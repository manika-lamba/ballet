A Folk Tale (Danish: Et Folkesagn) is a ballet in three acts, created in 1854 for the Royal Danish Ballet by the Danish ballet master and choreographer August Bournonville to the music of Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann and Niels W. Gade. The first performance took place on 20 March 1854. Set in the Middle Ages, the ballet tells the story of a changeling living among the trolls and elves. Bournonville declared the ballet ""The most complete and best of all my choreographic works.""[1]


Background[edit]
At the beginning of the 1850s, Svend Grundtvig initiated a systematic recording of Danish folklore - the stories were told and written down in every little village in Denmark – but Bournonville did not credit Grundtvig as his source of inspiration, even though today Grundtvig is probably considered to be the person who made the most effort to preserve the wealth of Danish national folk tradition. Bournonville found his inspiration in a collection of national Danish songs (Nationalmelodier) published by the philologist R. Nyerup and the composer A.P. Berggren in J.M. Thiele's collection of Danish folk legends (Danske Folkesagn) published in four volumes between 1818 and 1823. Bournonville also found inspiration in the tales collected by the Grimm brothers in Germany.
The Romantic artists had a passion for the national and the past. The early part of the 19th century was a difficult time both politically and economically for Denmark, and this naturally generated a glorification of times past. The emergent bourgeoisie needed to consolidate its cultural status and found motifs for this in national folklore. The economic growth in a rapidly expanding Copenhagen had to some extent overshadowed spiritual development. Artists interpreted their contemporary society in a purely materialistic light. Oehlenschläger's poem about The Golden Horns (Guldhornene) is probably the most famous example of this issue but Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale The Bell (Klokken) depicted the materialistic fixation of the period with humour, irony and gravity.
In the chapter about A Folk Tale in My Theatre Life (Mit Teaterliv), Bournonville makes his attitude to the present and the past clear: he indicates that our practical and rather unpoetic times (which seem about to precipitate a period of literary and artistic crop failure on the very lands that were once the richest soil of the imagination) art has fallen by the wayside. The poetic past has been replaced by a 'hypercritical' present, as Bournonville himself writes, and it is the duty of the artist to restore the spiritual, the poetry.
The artist saw himself as endowed by God with the ability to sense the true values and perspective in life. This insight was to be communicated to the ordinary citizen through art.
The function of art as a formative model was something about which Bournonville felt very strongly. In his choreographic credo he writes: It is the mission of art in general, and the theatre in particular, to intensify thought, to elevate the mind, and to refresh the senses. Music and dance elevate the mind and refresh the senses, but it is when the story comes into play that thought is intensified.
A Folk Tale takes as its starting point the archetypal dilemma of the folk ballad, the transition from one home to another in the context of a wedding, where both men and women run the risk of getting into difficulties. The men might be lured under a spell by elves and the women might be carried off by disguised nixes and it always happens in an outdoor, natural environment, which is both compelling and mysterious. Both the elves and the nixes exert a demonic and erotic power over the victims and in most cases have a fateful impact on them - many end in the grave.
Bournonville must have had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) in mind when he has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a beautiful and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For the young man in the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and the young man, who had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.
Despite this, Bournonville decided to compose his own version of the story about the young man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an engraving from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that she is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation in the same way as the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.
Even though both Junker Ove and Hilda suspect that they are in the wrong place in their lives as the story begins, they are not able to act on their own initiative. The dream gives Hilda an inkling of this other life, and the dream by the hill gives Junker Ove an idea about the ideal woman, but it is the crucifix and the golden goblet, two Christian symbols, which reveal the truth of the matter. Christianity is to be thanked for the restoration of harmony. Junker Ove gets his Hilda, and the promise of gold persuades Sir Mogens to be united with Birthe who, in a modern interpretation, represents the young woman with the unruly disposition unable to conform to society's norms. She is handed over - troll for gold - to Sir Mogens in order to continue her life somewhere else completely.
Following Bournonville's death, Hans Beck took over the stewardship of the ballets. In 1894,  A Folk Tale was once again on stage, in Hans Beck's production. It has since been passed down from generation to generation, re-read and re-staged by successive Bournonville interpreters: Gustav Uhlendorff in 1922, Kaj Smith in 1931, Harald Lander and Valborg Borschsenius in 1941, Niels-Bjørn Larsen and Gerda Karstens in 1952, Hans Brenaa and Kirsten Ralov in 1969, Kirsten Ralov in 1977 and 1979. The most recent version of this lively folklorist ballet was produced in 1991, staged by Frank Andersen and Anne Marie Vessel Schlüter, with settings and costumes designed by Queen Margrethe II.

Plot summary[edit]
Act I
The wealthy but fickle Birthe enjoys a forest outing with friends. She flirts with Sir Mogens though her bethrothed, the handsome Junker Ove is present. When the party leaves for home, Ove remains behind. An elf-hill nearby opens. Hilda, an elf-girl, tries to lure Ove into the hill with a magic drink in a gold cup but he refuses it and she returns to the elf-hill. The sorceress Muri conjures up a bevy of elf-girls who dance with Ove and leave him deranged.
Act II
In the elf-hill, troll brothers Diderik and Viderik both woo Hilda. Diderik, the elder, has the right of priority. Viderik protests, but his mother scolds him. In a dream, Hilda sees trolls take a human child from a cradle and steal a gold cup. Hilda recognizes the dream cup as the one she offered Ove. She suspects she is the human child in the dream and becomes uneasy. The wedding of Hilda and Diderik is celebrated with a feast. The trolls become drunk and Hilda flees.
Act III
In scene 1, Hilda dances near a holy spring as harvesters pass by and Mogens notices her. Junker Ove walks by, completely elf-struck after his nocturnal dances with the elf-girls. Hilda leads him to the healing spring where he regains his senses. When Ove tries to defend Hilda against Mogens, he is overpowered by the harvesters. Hilda flees. In scene 2, Birthe bullies her servants. She rages and admits that Hilda is the true heir to the estate while she is an elf. In the last scene of the ballet, Mogens marries Birthe after Muri offers him gold. Hilda is united with Junker Ove. Hilda and Ove celebrate their wedding with a waltz.

Sheet music Et Folkesagn
Music[edit]
Niels W. Gade provided the music for the beech forest scenes of Acts I and III, while J.P.E. Hartmann composed the music with an Old Norse tone for the burlesque trolls in Act II.
Act I presents the principal musical characteristics: the brisk music of the hunt, the ballad-like folksong melodies, the nobles' dignified minuet, the peasants' reel and the elf maidens' dance. Gade's orchestration shows patent inspiration from Felix Mendelssohn (1809–1957) and his A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Hartmann's music for Act II is typified by a clear-cut character idiom in which rhythmic tension and dark resonance dominate. For Hilda's solo he composed an elegant bolero and a festive galop for the drunken trolls.
In Act III, the final scene features a gypsy polonaise, followed by the Bridal Waltz, a famous composition Gade considered to be a trifle, but which nowadays accompanies practically every Danish wedding.

Edwin Landseer, Scene from A Midsummer Night's Dream, Titania and Bottom, 1851
A Midsummer Night's Dream is a two-act ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Felix Mendelssohn's music to Shakespeare's play of the same name.


History[edit]
A Midsummer Night's Dream, Balanchine's first completely original full-length ballet, premiered at New York City Ballet on 17 January 1962,[1][2] with Edward Villella in the role of Oberon, Melissa Hayden in the role of Titania, and Arthur Mitchell in the role of Puck. They were joined by Francisco Moncion in the role of Theseus- Duke of Athens.[3]

Description[edit]
In addition to the incidental music, Balanchine incorporated other Mendelssohn works into the ballet, including the Overtures to Athalie, Son and Stranger, and The Fair Melusine, the ""String Symphony No. 9 in C minor"" and The First Walpurgis Night.[1]
The ballet employs a large children's corps de ballet.[4]  Act I tells Shakespeare's familiar story of lovers and fairies while Act II presents a strictly classical dance wedding celebration.  The ballet dispenses with Shakespeare's play-within-a-play finale.  A Midsummer Night's Dream opened The New York City Ballet's first season at the New York State Theater in April, 1964.[1]

Videography[edit]
A 1966 performance was filmed and released the following year. It featured Suzanne Farrell, Edward Villella, Arthur Mitchell and Gloria Govrin.[5]
A performance in 1986 was filmed as a part of Live from Lincoln Center. The Lincoln Center released the video online in light of the impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts.[6]
In 1999, a Pacific Northwest Ballet performance at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London was filmed and released as a DVD.[7]
The Paris Opera Ballet also released a recording of a performance during the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic , which featured Eleonora Abbagnato, Laëtitia Pujol, Alice Renavand, Stéphane Bullion, Hugo Marchand and Karl Paquette.[8]
When the coronavirus pandemic cut short the San Francisco Ballet 2020 performance to just its opening night on March 6, it was subsequently recorded in an empty War Memorial Opera House shortly after its opening and released as part of the all-digital 2021 season.[9][10]

3,A Month in the Country,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Month_in_the_Country_(ballet%29,"A Month in the Country , to music by Frédéric Chopin , 1976","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



A Month in the Country is a narrative ballet created in 1976 with choreography by Frederick Ashton, to the music of Frédéric Chopin (three works for piano and orchestra) arranged by John Lanchbery. It is based on the play by Ivan Turgenev of the same name, and lasts for about 40 minutes.[1]


History[edit]
Ashton had had the idea of a ballet based on A Month in the Country since seeing the play in the 1930s at the Westminster Theatre, but a meeting with Isaiah Berlin in the late 1960s helped him decide on the subject, and he took up Berlin's suggestion of using the music of Chopin. During the preparation of the ballet, Ashton encouraged the dancers to see the play in London with Dorothy Tutin as Natalia.[2] Ashton also credited Michael Somes ""who brought the music used in the ballet to my notice"" and Martyn Thomas who helped construct the action of the ballet to correspond with this music.[3]
The ballet was first performed on Thursday, 12 February 1976, by The Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, with Lynn Seymour and Anthony Dowell in the leading roles; later interpreters have included Merle Park and Sylvie Guillem as Natalia and Michael Coleman, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Bruce Sansom and Ivan Putrov as Belaiev. The work was performed by the Royal Ballet every season from 1976 to 1979 and has been regularly revived at Covent Garden.[4]
It has also been seen on tour in New York and Havana. In 1995, Dowell mounted the ballet for the National Ballet of Canada with Karen Kain as Natalia and Robert Conn as Beliaev, the first time it had been performed by any other company.
Peggy Ashcroft – after seeing a performance – told Ashton that she thought his adaptation was better than the original.[2]

Story[edit]
The action takes place at Yslaev's country house in 1850.
The story concerns the emotional disturbance caused by the presence of a tutor in the home of a country Russian family. Natalia Petrovna, a bored wife, falls for the young tutor of Kolia, Belaiev. The ballet contains a series of pas de deux (dance of two people) which carry the action forward: Natalia and her admirer Rakitin, followed by Belaiev and Vera, then Natalia's ward, Belaiev and the maid Katia, and finally Belaiev and Natalia. In the finale, Vera summons the household to witness the embraces of Natalia and Belaiev; Rakitin tells Belaiev that both should leave the house. Alone on stage, Natalia despairs at the young man's departure, but he returns unseen and unheard and leaves her the rose she had given him.

Music[edit]
The music is by Chopin:

Variations on ""Là ci darem la mano"" in B-flat major
Fantaisie brillante on Polish Airs in A major
Andante spianato et grande polonaise brillante[5]
Ashton dedicated the work to Sophie Fedorovitch and Bronislava Nijinska ""Chopin's compatriots and my mentors"".[3]
An audio recording of the ballet score prepared by Lanchbery and conducted by him, with the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and Philip Gammon (piano) was issued on the HMV Greensleeve label in 1977.[6] It was filmed for television in May 1978 (after The Dream), with Seymour and Dowell, and issued on videotape.[7]

A Suite of Dances is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to Johann Sebastian Bach's Cello Suites. The ballet was created for Mikhail Baryshnikov and premiered on March 3, 1994, at the New York State Theater.[1]


Production[edit]
Jerome Robbins had earlier attempted to choreograph Bach's Cello Suites with dancers Victor Castelli and Peter Boal, although the project was abandoned. He used the music for A Suite of Dances with Mikhail Baryshnikov, who was in his 40s, as the sole dancer instead.[2][3] As Baryshnikov was touring and Robbins was staging his works in Paris and St. Petersburg, A Suite of Dances was made over the course of two years, and according to Robbins, most of the choreography was made without Baryshnikov's presence,[2][3] before the ballet, a 16-minutes-long solo,[2] premiered at a performance of the White Oak Dance Project, Baryshnikov's company, with Wendy Sutter on the cello.[4]

Music[edit]
The ballet uses the following music from Bach's Cello Suites:[1]

Prelude from Suite No. 1 in G major, BWV 1007
Sarabande from Suite No. 5 in C minor, BWV 1011
Gigue from Suite No. 1 in G major, BWV 1007
Prelude from Suite No. 6 in D major, BWV 1012
Revivals[edit]
In May 1994, at a New York City Ballet performance, Baryshnikov performed A Suite of Dances as a guest artist, with Sutter also returning.[5] The ballet then entered Paris Opera Ballet's repertory, and New York City Ballet's members danced it for the first time in 1997.[6] In subsequent revivals, the ballet is usually danced by an experienced dancer.[2] In March 1999, eight months after Robbins died, Nicolas Le Riche danced  A Suite of Dances at a Robbins tribute gala organized by the Paris Opera Ballet.[7] In 2008, at New York City Ballet's Jerome Robbins Celebration program, Le Riche reprised the role.[8] The ballet has also been performed at Carlos Acosta's solo program in 2009 and the Vail Dance Festival in 2018, by American Ballet Theatre's Herman Cornejo.[9][10]

Videography[edit]
In light of the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, Paris Opera Ballet released a recording of  A Suite of Dances, as a part of the Tribute to Jerome Robbins program.[11]  The Vail Dance Festival released a video of an excerpt danced by Cornejo online.[12]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Frederick Ashton's first ballet
A Tragedy of Fashion, or the Scarlet Scissors is a ballet which was first choreographed and performed on 15 June 1926 by Frederick Ashton, who starred with Marie Rambert. The BBC described this debut as ""a pivotal moment in the history of ballet,"" as it launched the careers of both Ashton and Ballet Rambert.[1] The music was by Eugene Goossens, arranged by Ernest Irving.
The ballet was inspired by the tragic suicide of the 17th-century French chef, François Vatel. In 1671, Vatel was responsible for a grand banquet in honour of King Louis XIV and became so upset that the fish delivery was late that he killed himself with a sword.[1][2] In the ballet, the tale is of a couturier who despairs when his work is not liked and then kills himself with a pair of scissors.[3] The style of the ballet was influenced by the sophisticated productions of Sergei Diaghilev in the 1920s such as Les biches.[4]

It was Ashton's first choreographed work and it was for a 1926 revue staged by Nigel Playfair and Rambert's husband Ashley Dukes. The Observer commented: an engaging little ballet called 'A Tragedy of Fashion: or The Scarlet Scissors' which Mr. Eugene Goossens has set most suitably to music. Miss Marie Rambert, as an impudently vivacious mannequin, and Mr. Frederick Ashton as a distracted man modist, lead the dancing. It is as chic a trifle as Mr Playfair's modish establishment leads you to expect.[5] The costumes and scenery were by Sophie Fedorovitch, who continued to work with Ashton for more than twenty years, and became, in his words, ""not only my dearest friend but my greatest artistic collaborator and adviser.""[6]
In 2004, Ballet Rambert revived it as part of their celebration of Ashton's birth centenary, reinterpreted and restyled by choreographer Ian Spink, following six months of research. The Guardian review gave it four stars and commented ""It is a witty and clever achievement but Spink and his superb collaborators have gone one better. They have imbued Tragedy with the quality that made Ashton irresistible – his charm.""[7]

Adam Zero is a ballet with music composed by Arthur Bliss and choreographed by Robert Helpmann in 1946.


Background[edit]
After World War I, Bliss developed an interest in ballet after seeing the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev in London. Bliss composed Adam Zero for the Sadler's Wells Ballet, in collaboration with Michael Benthall[1] and Robert Helpmann, with whom he had seen success with Miracle in the Gorbals. The first performance at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden in London on 6 April 1946 was conducted by Constant Lambert.[2]  The premiere dancers included the following:

David Paltenghi (The Stage Director)
June Brae (The Choreographer / The Ballerina)
Robert Helpmann[3] (Adam Zero)
Jean Bedells (The Designer)
Julia Farron (The Wardrobe Mistress)
Gillian Lynne (The Daughter)
Palma Nye (The Dresser)
Leslie Edwards (The Mime)
Gordon Hamilton (The Dog)
Bliss considered Adam Zero his ""most varied and exciting ballet score; the music is instinctively theatrical and strongly characterized.""[4] The orchestra is augmented by cor anglais, saxophone, tuba, two standard percussionists and two dance band percussionists, plus celesta and harp.
It was revived as a ballet with choreography by Sergei Vanaev and conducted by Marc Niemann at the Stadttheater Bremerhaven in 2016.[5]

Sections[edit]
Fanfare Overture: Allegro Molto[6]
The Stage: Andante sostenuto [7]
Birth of Adam: Molto sostenuto

Destruction of Adam’s World: Allegro molto
Approach of Winter: Andantino
Dance with Death: Largo maestoso
Finale – the stage is reset for the next life-cycle: Allegro moderato
The complete ballet runs for around 40 minutes.

Synopsis[edit]
The ballet is an allegory of the cycle of man’s life; the world in which he lives is represented by a stage on which a ballet is being created: Adam is cast as the principal dancer, Omnipotence is represented by the Stage Director and Adam’s Fates by the Designer, Wardrobe Mistress and Dresser.
Adam falls in love, marries, and achieves power, but his triumph is brief; his world crumbles about him, he is stripped of his glory, and a new generation (Understudy) takes his place. He seeks distraction in dissipation but everyone deserts him and he is left alone to face Death.[2]

Ballet choreographed by Hans van Manen


Adagio HammerklavierChoreographerHans van ManenMusicLudwig van BeethovenPremiere4 October 1973 (1973-10-04)StadsschouwburgOriginal ballet companyDutch National BalletDesignJean-Paul Vroom
Adagio Hammerklavier is a ballet choreographed by Hans van Manen to the Adagio from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 29, Hammerklavier. The ballet is plotless and danced by three couples. Van Manen made Adagio Hammerklavier for the Dutch National Ballet, and it premiered on 4 October 1973, at the Stadsschouwburg, Amsterdam.


Production[edit]
Van Manen decided to choreograph a new ballet on six Dutch National Ballet dancers, Monique Sand, Sonja Marchiolli, Alexandra Radius, Henry Jurriëns, Francis Sinceretti, Han Ebbelaar [nl], when the company was rehearsing Swan Lake. Though the six were also set to dance in Swan Lake, the rehearsal schedule made them available at the same time while the rest of the company were working on the production.[1]
Van Manen set the ballet to the Adagio, the third movement from Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 29, Hammerklavier. He was inspired by Christoph Eschenbach's recording of the music, which was played at an exceptionally slow tempo.[1] Van Manen explained, ""I thought adagio. You hardly ever see adagio; you see slow motion, but that's different. That's based on total balance. I always think of adagio as a wheel that you push – and that moment where the wheel is still moving, just before it falls.""[1]
The costumes and set were designed by Jean-Paul Vroom, with the women in pale blue chiffon dresses, and the men in white tights, bare-chested and wearing necklaces. The decor features a white curtain at the back of the stage.[1][2]

Choreography[edit]
Dance critic Zoë Anderson wrote, ""Like many of van Manen's works, Adagio Hammerklavier is a plotless work with a strong edge of sexual drama."" She noted although the ballet was created in a time when choreographers were experimenting with complex lifts, in Adagio Hammerklavier, women are ""curling and drooping to the floor.""[1] She added that in other parts of the ballet, ""couples move in unison... With unexpected assertiveness walks will turn unto stamps. The dancing is understated, gaining drama from small turns of the head or changes of pose, small details that break the line of the choreography.""[1]

Performances[edit]
Adagio Hammerklavier premiered on 4 October 1973, at the Stadsschouwburg, Amsterdam.[3]
Other ballet companies performing Adagio Hammerklavier include the Royal Ballet in London, Houston Ballet, Berlin Opera Ballet,[3] Mariinsky Ballet,[4] English National Ballet,[5] Stuttgart Ballet,[6] La Scala Theatre Ballet,[7] Pennsylvania Ballet and Northern Ballet.[8][9]

Ballet by Nijinsky
This article is about the Nijinsky ballet. For musical composition by Claude Debussy, see Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. For other ballets and uses, see Afternoon of a Faun.
L'Après-midi d'un fauneProgramme illustration by Léon Bakst for the balletChoreographerVaslav NijinskyMusicClaude DebussyBased onL'Après-midi d'un faune by Stéphane MallarméPremiere29 May 1912Théâtre du Châtelet in ParisOriginal ballet companyBallets RussesDesignLéon BakstSettingWoodland gladeCreated forSergei Diaghilev
The ballet, The Afternoon of a Faun (French: L'Après-midi d'un faune), was choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky for the Ballets Russes, and was first performed in the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris on 29 May 1912. Nijinsky danced the main part himself. The music is Claude Debussy's symphonic poem Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. Both the music and the ballet were inspired by the poem L'Après-midi d'un faune by Stéphane Mallarmé. The costumes, sets and programme illustrations were designed by the painter Léon Bakst.
The style of the 12-minute ballet, in which a young faun meets several nymphs and proceeds to flirt with and chase them, was deliberately archaic. In the original scenography designed by Léon Bakst, the dancers were presented as part of a large tableau, a staging reminiscent of an ancient Greek vase painting. They often moved across the stage in profile as if on a bas relief. The ballet was presented in bare feet and rejected classical formalism. The work had an overtly erotic subtext beneath its façade of Greek antiquity and ended with a scene of graphic sexual desire. This led to a controversial reception from both audience and critics, and the quality of the ballet was debated widely through multiple news reviews. The piece also led to the dissolution of a partnership between Nijinsky and Michel Fokine, another prominent choreographer for the Ballets Russes, due to the extensive amount of time required to train the dancers in what was then an unconventional style of dance.
L'Après-midi d'un Faune is considered one of the first modern ballets and proved to be as controversial as Nijinsky's Jeux (1913) and Le Sacre du printemps (1913).


Creation[edit]
Conception[edit]
The ballet was developed as a possible new production for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Michel Fokine choreographed most of the dances that the company performed. Fokine had originally worked as a choreographer with the Imperial Russian Ballet. In addition to Fokine, all the different specialists for the new ballet company had also come from the Imperial Russian Ballet company. Initially, the Ballets Russes took advantage of the 3 months summer break when the Imperial ballet closed and its staff were free to do other things. The Ballets Russes used this time to stage their own ballets and operas in Paris. Diaghilev began looking around for an alternative to the style which Fokine customarily delivered before deciding to allow his senior male dancer, Vaslav Nijinsky, to try his hand at choreography.

Menelaus intending to strike Helen is struck by her beauty instead. Louvre museum, Campana collection acquired 1861
Diaghilev, Nijinsky, and Bakst developed the original idea for The Afternoon of a Faun. The artwork on ancient Greek vases and Egyptian and Assyrian frescoes, which they viewed in the Louvre museum, was their source of inspiration.[1] Bakst had previously worked with Vsevolod Meyerhold who was an innovative theatre producer and director that had introduced concepts like two-dimensionality, stylized postures, a narrow stage, and pauses and pacing to emphasise significant moments into his productions. Bakst, Nijinsky, and Diaghilev transferred these concepts to a ballet format in Faun.[2] Nijinsky's aim was to reproduce the stylised look of the ancient artworks on the stage. In his portrayal of the faun, Nijinsky managed to reproduce exactly the figure of a satyr shown on Greek vases in the Louvre.[3][4]

Development[edit]
Jean Cocteau, a French poet, explained the Mallarmé poem to Nijinsky who spoke little French, and helped develop an outline for the ballet's acts. Claude Debussy's symphonic poem, Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune, was used for the orchestral music. After the summer season in Paris, Nijinsky returned to St Petersburg for the new Russian season. There, he began work on the choreography with the help of his sister, Bronislava Nijinska, who was herself a senior dancer. Bronislava would later choreograph her own ballets for the Ballets Russes.[1]
Léon Bakst designed the stage setting which was more impressionist than representational. The splashes of muted greys, browns, and greens on the backcloth mirrored the fluid music, suggesting the scene rather than defining it precisely. It was hung at the line of the second wings rather than the back of the stage to deliberately narrow the performance space. The stage floorcloth was black as far back as the mound which the Faun lies upon. From there, it was green to the back of the stage. Baskt organized the lighting to emphasise the flattened look of the dance.[5]

A design by Léon Bakst for the stage setting
The dancers' costumes were designed to stand out against the muted background. Nijinsky wore a cream body suit with brown piebald patches to represent the coat of an animal. His faun costume was completed with the addition of a short tail, a belt of vine leaves, and a cap of woven golden hair surrounding two golden horns which gave the impression of a circlet. Nijinsky's ears were extended with wax to look more pronounced and pointed while his makeup was designed to make his face appear more animal. The nymphs wore white muslin that was tailored into long pleated tunics and decorated with stencilled patterns in blue or rust red. Some tunics had checkered borders and others had wavy lines or leaves. The nymphs had little makeup, except that their eyes were painted in pale pink. They wore tight wigs of golden rope which hung down in long strands. The Faun and senior nymph wore golden sandals while the rest of the dancers had bare white feet with rouged toes.[5]

Difficulties[edit]
Vaslav Nijinsky was an exceptional dancer but not an exceptional teacher. Nijinsky's sister notes in her memoir that, throughout the development of all his ballets, he had difficulty explaining to others what he needed them to do and operated through demonstration rather than explanation. Bronislava notes that Nijinsky ignored the gap in ability between the dancers he directed and his artistic vision for the choreography. Nijinsky had difficulty accepting the limitations of others, expecting them to be able to perform as well as he could. Bronislava acted as his guinea-pig, trying out dances and positions. She describes the experience as feeling as though Nijinsky were a sculptor and she the clay which he positioned through each step.[6]
Nijinsky and his sister performed the partially developed work for Diaghilev and Bakst in St. Petersburg at the start of 1911. From the beginning, the ballet's development was kept secret until Diaghilev was ready to stage it, because he feared it would offend Fokine. The company was relying on Fokine for other ballets that were also in production, and thought that he might walk out if his position as undisputed choreographer to the company was challenged. The régisseur, Grigoriev, was let into the secret in early 1912. In March of the same year, rehearsals began with other members of the company. Fokine, who now knew about the project, resented the loss of rehearsal time for his own productions. He attacked Nijinsky's incompetence at getting across his own ideas, claimed he only had the job because he was Diaghilev's lover, and announced his intention to resign which confirmed Diaghilev's fears.[7]
The 12-minute ballet required 90 rehearsals. This led to the reduction of time Fokine received with the dancers which was the basis for many of his complaints. All the dancers suffered the same difficulties Bronislava had reported in trying to adapt to the strange new movements. Nijinsky's choreography felt completely unnatural to them which lengthened the time they needed for training. By this time, Nijinsky had fully devised what he wanted each dancer to do, so he could focus on training them without having to work on developing the ballet at the same time. The general view amongst the dancers was that he was mad and the ballet was doomed to failure. Even Diaghilev started to have doubts and asked Nijinsky whether there might be changes to the difficult choreography. In response to this, Nijinsky threatened to resign.[8]

Choreography[edit]
Much of the movement takes place with groups of dancers passing each other in parallel lines, as if in a moving frieze. As the focus of attention passes from one group to another, dancers take a stylised pose, as might be seen on an ancient vase, and become still. The music is suggestive of a languorous summer's day in an exotic clime, and the dancers move steadily and languorously to match.[5]

The Faun locks arms with the nymph
The ballet starts with the sound of a flute as the curtain rises to show the faun lying on his mound. The faun is supporting himself with his left arm while his right holds a flute to his lips. He then eats from first one and then another bunch of grapes, holding them to his face. The movements are stylised and angular, but are also suggestive of the movements of an animal. The flute music is then joined by horns and a rippling harp. As the flute tune repeats for the third time, three nymphs walk on from the left of the stage with synchronised, stylised movements. Then, two more nymphs, moving in unison but differently from the first group, join the other dancers onstage.
They perform a long arabesque to music from two flutes and a harp. These instruments are joined by strings as the music progresses while a sixth nymph walks to centre stage and holds a pose before joining the pair. The six nymphs freeze when the last nymph enters with a mechanical walk across the stage as she lets her outer veils fall to reveal a short golden garment beneath. The nymphs all begin to move. The tableau on the stage consists of a group of three, a group of two, and a single nymph who either dances with the pair to balance the scene or strikes poses at variance to the pair.[9]
The faun remains motionless as the first six nymphs enter, but then he follows the progress of the last nymph with his eyes. A clarinet starts to play as his head begins to move, and he rises to his feet as a cello joins in. The six nymphs have begun to bathe the new arrival. Accompanied by an oboe, they move in and out, kneeling and rising with their elbows turned out from their sides as they keep their hands pointed at their waists or to the sky. Violins accompany an increase in tempo as the faun descends from his mound. The pair of nymphs depart to the left of the stage carrying one of the discarded veils while the first three nymphs carry off a second veil to the left. The music changes to a soulful clarinet solo. The sixth nymph who has been left isolated centre stage suddenly notices the faun behind her and runs off to the left, hands in air.[9]
The faun and the last nymph are alone on stage as the music changes with a new air of excitement from the woodwind section which builds along with the violins and the harp. The faun approaches the nymph with bursts of movement, and the two dance around each other in a standoffish courting display. He executes his only jump in the ballet across an imagined stream issuing from a waterfall shown on the backdrop. The music becomes louder as the nymph becomes more enthusiastic. It subsides again as they link arms, but she breaks away and exits flat footed to the left. The faun watches her go in disappointment before smiling, then he turns back to her discarded veil. To a solo violin backed by horns, flute, and clarinet, the faun throws back his head and bares his teeth. Laughing, he takes the veil. He examines it with great delight as the harp and the flute repeat the opening melody.[9]

The faun starts to lie down on the nymph's veilThe woodwind brings in staccato chords as the three nymphs return from stage left to challenge the faun who falls back from their advance. The music changes with an oboe taking up the tune as the nymphs turn back offstage again with their hands in the air. The faun examines the veil, holding it in the air against his head until the cor anglais and flutes accompany the pair of nymphs as they enter from stage left. They again challenge the faun with flapping arms, and are followed by the lagging sixth nymph who dances the same challenge just as the pair turn to leave. The faun falls back, exchanging stares with the nymphs before the last nymph breaks off and she too retires. The faun is now alone. He nods his head over the veil and returns to his mound. A cello and flute carry the tune with the harp continuing in the background. The faun holds the veil to his face before spreading it on the ground and lowering his body onto it with his head tucked in and arms to his sides. Soft horns and a harp accompany a final flute passage as his body tenses and curls back, head rising, before relaxing back onto the veil.[10]
Lydia Sokolova, the first English dancer in the Ballets Russes, described Nijinsky's performance as ""thrilling."" She highlighted his powerful, animalistic movements in his handling of the nymph's veil, and lauded his acting during this visceral scene.[11]

Premiere and reaction[edit]
On 28 May 1912, an invited audience attended the dress rehearsal. There was silence as it finished. Gabriel Astruc, a French impresario who assisted Diaghilev with finance, publicity, and bookings, came on stage and announced that the ballet would be repeated. This time, there was some applause before the audience was presented champagne and caviar in the theatre foyer.
The Afternoon of a Faun was premiered on 29 May at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris. The faun was danced by Vaslav Nijinsky, senior nymph by Nelidova, and Bronislava Nijinska danced the 6th nymph. The conductor was Pierre Monteux. On the opening night, the ballet was met with a mixture of applause and booing, and again it was repeated. After the repeated performance, the audience applauded, and the sculptor, Auguste Rodin who was in the audience, stood up to cheer.[12]
Commedia published a long article by its editor, Gaston de Pawlowski, where he praised the ballet and supported articles by Louis Vuillemain and Louis Schneider.[13] Vuillemain wrote that this ballet had the most pleasing acting, dancing, and music he had ever seen before.[14] Le Théâtre carried a review by Schneider where he applauded Nijinsky's ability to accurately adapt his choreography to Debussy's composition.[15]
A strikingly different response appeared in Le Figaro, where the editor, Gaston Calmette, also carried a front page article on the ballet. Calmette denounced the ballet after declining to publish the favourable report of his normal theatre critic, Robert Brussel.[16] Calmette wrote that the ballet was not artful, imaginative, nor meaningful. He then goes on to criticize the choreography of the faun as being ""filthy"" and ""indecent"", which he argued deservedly incited the booing at the initial showings.[17] Calmette was much more complimentary about Nijinsky's other performances that were part of the same evening's schedule as the showing of the Faun. He applauded Nijinsky in Le Spectre de la Rose, which Michel Fokine choreographed, and said that this was the kind of ballet that should be performed for the public.[17]

Cartoon by Daniel de Losques published in Le Figaro, 30 May 1912
Diaghilev responded to Calmette by forwarding letters of support to Le Figaro which they published the following day. The painter, Odilon Redon, a friend of Mallarmé, suggested how much the author of the original poem on which the ballet had been based would have approved: ""more than anyone, he would have appreciated this wonderful evocation of his thoughts.""[18]
In another letter that Diaghilev submitted, Auguste Rodin wrote that Nijinsky's acting and attention to detail over the movements of his body worked wonderfully to convey the character and mind of the faun. Rodin noticed the antique forms of the frescoes and other art in Nijinsky's display. The artist expressed the feeling that Nijinsky was a sculptor's ""ideal model.""[19]
The dispute over the ballet spread, taking on a political tone. Le Figaro was accused of attacking the Ballets Russes because they opposed France's political policy to ally with Russia, and that they represented an opening to smear all things Russian.[20] The Russian ambassador became involved, French politicians signed petitions, and the President and Prime Minister asked a government commission to report. The Paris police attended the second night of the ballet because of its alleged obscenity, but took no action after they saw the public's support. The ending of the ballet may have been temporarily amended to be more proper. Tickets to all performances were sold out, and Parisians clamoured to obtain them by any means.[21]
Michel Fokine claimed to be shocked by the explicit ending of Faun, despite at the same time suggesting that the idea of the faun lying down in a sexual manner on top of the nymph's veil had been plagiarised from his own ballet Tannhäuser. In this ballet, Fokine choreographed the hero to lie down in a comparable manner upon a woman. However, Fokine found some points to compliment in the ballet, including the use of pauses by the dancers where traditionally there would have been continuous movement, as well as the juxtaposition of angular choreography with the very fluid music.[22]
Fokine's animosity to Faun is partly explainable by his own difficulties in preparing Daphnis and Chloe, which was to premiere the week following Faun but was not complete. Diaghilev tried to cancel Daphnis; instead it was postponed to 8 June. Daphnis only received two performances even though it was considered a success by critics such as Le Figaro. The company was sharply divided into two factions by the quarrel, some supporting Nijinsky and some Fokine. The final result consisted of Fokine leaving the company on bad terms with Nijinsky regardless of the fact that the partnership between Nijinsky as dancer and Fokine as choreographer had been enormously successful for them both.

Further performances by the Ballets Russes[edit]

The Ballets Russes chose not to show Faun in the London season immediately following its Paris appearance. Instead, the company premiered L'Oiseau de feu, Narcisse, and Thamar for the first time in London. In the autumn, a German tour began at the Stadt-Theater in Cologne on 30 October before moving to the New Royal opera House in Berlin on 11 December. The Berlin programme included Faun which was performed before the Kaiser, the King of Portugal, and sundry dignitaries. Diaghilev reported to Astruc that this showing was a ""huge success"" which resulted in ten encores without protest.[23] Serge Gregoriev, who had just resigned from the Mariinsky Theatre to join Diaghilev full-time as stage manager, was more sanguine, reporting that ""faun fell flat,"" but he confirmed the overall success of the German tour.[24]
In spring 1913, the ballet was performed in Vienna, where it again had a cool reception, though not so bad as Petrushka, which the orchestra of the Vienna Opera House initially refused to play because they disliked the music.[25] The company returned to London, where the response was completely different and both ballets were well-received. During its first performance, there was some hissing in the audience, but the majority favoured it, and it received an encore once again. The Times described Nijinsky's performance as ""extraordinarily expressive,"" and complimented the ballet on its ability to appeal to the audience in a way the public had never seen a ballet do before.[26] Writing in the Daily Mail, music critic Richard Capell said, ""The miracle of the thing lies with Nijinsky – the fabulous Nijinsky, the peerless dancer, who as the faun does no dancing.""[27] Capell goes on to praise his acting as well as the single leap which he deems an ""illumination"" of the faun's dichotomy between man and animal.[28]

Later performances by other companies[edit]
In 1931, shortly after the death of Diaghilev, when some of his dancers settled in London, the Rambert Ballet took L'Après-midi d'un faune into its repertoire.[29] Leon Woizikovsky, who had danced the faun in the last years of the Diaghilev company and whom Nijinsky taught, reproduced the ballet for Rambert's company.[30] Rambert Ballet revived Faun for several years.[31] The reproduction met with criticism from Cyril Beaumont who commented in his book that the ballet becomes “meaningless, if given, as sometimes happens, without the essential nymphs.”[32]
At the Nureyev Festival at the London Coliseum in July 1983, Rudolf Nureyev danced the faun as part of a Homage to Diaghilev in a mixed bill of ballets.[33] Then, in the late 1980s, dance notation specialists Ann Hutchinson Guest and Claudia Jeschke reconstructed the ballet from Nijinsky's own notebooks, his dance notation, and the photographs of the dancers that Baron Adolph de Meyer produced shortly after the original performance of the ballet. This reconstructed version is often presented alongside Nijinsky's other works or repertoire from the Ballets Russes.

Lita Grey Chaplin, the second wife of Charlie Chaplin,  notes in her memoir that the nymph dance in the dream sequence of the Chaplin film Sunnyside (1919) was a tribute to the ballet as well as to Nijinsky whom the filmmaker had met two years prior.[34]
A pastiche of the ballet forms part of the music video for Queen's 1984 single I Want to Break Free. Freddie Mercury dances the role of the faun, with dancers from the Royal Ballet also performing, including Jeremy Sheffield. This version also proved controversial in the US.[citation needed]

Ballet by Jerome Robbins

Afternoon of a Faun is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to Claude Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. The ballet features two young dancers meeting at a rehearsal studio. Robbins was influenced by Stéphane Mallarmé's poem L'après-midi d'un faune, the inspiration for Debussy's score, as well as Vaslav Nijinsky's 1912 ballet to the same score, and his own observation of dancers.
The ballet was made for the New York City Ballet, and premiered on May 14, 1953, at the City Center of Music and Drama, with the two roles of the ballet originated by Tanaquil Le Clercq and Francisco Moncion. Afternoon of a Faun has since been performed by various other ballet companies.


Background and development[edit]
Claude Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune was inspired by Stéphane Mallarmé's poem L'après-midi d'un faune, about a faun's encounter with nymphs. The first ballet set to the score was choreographed by Vaslav Nijinsky and premiered in 1912. This ballet was scandalous due to its overtly sexual nature.[1] Kasyan Goleizovsky and Serge Lifar made versions of the ballet in 1922 and 1935 respectively.[1] In 1940, Jerome Robbins made a parody of the Nijinsky ballet, titled PM of a Faun.[2]: 47  In 1948, Robbins joined the New York City Ballet soon after it was founded, as both a dancer and choreographer.[3]
For New York City Ballet's 1953 season, Robbins decided to choreograph to the Debussy score.[4] Robbins explained that he was inspired by various factors, including his fascination with the Nijinsky ballet.[5] He was inspired by watching Edward Villella, then a seventeen-year-old student at the School of American Ballet,[2]: 221  in a ballet class, who ""suddenly began to stretch his body in a very odd way, almost like he was trying to get something out of it. And I thought how animalistic it was... he didn't know what he was doing, and that sort of stuck in my head.""[5] Another source of inspiration was watching Louis Johnson, a young black dancer, and a female student rehearsing the adagio from Swan Lake while watching themselves in the mirror, and as Robbins described, he ""was struck by the way they were watching that couple over there doing a love dance and totally unaware of the proximity and possible sexuality of their physical encounter.""[2]: 221  Robbins also read a translation of Mallarmé's poem.[4]: 223 [5]
Robbins decided to set the ballet in a dance studio, rather than a Greek setting like the Nijinsky ballet. He removed the nymph attendants, and instead have two young dancers meeting in the studio.[4]: 223  Tanaquil Le Clercq was Robbins' first choice for portraying the female role.[4]: 222  When Robbins began working on the ballet, Le Clercq was still on her honeymoon.[2]: 223  Robbins original choice for the male role was Buzz Miller, who was not a member of the company. However, miscommunication between Miller and company co-founder George Balanchine prevented him from appearing as a guest artist.[4]: 222  Robbins also considered Johnson, who attended the School of American Ballet, and had previously danced in Robbins' Ballade as a guest artist.[3] He had one rehearsal with Le Clercq but was not cast.[4]: 222  In their respective biographies on Robbins, authors Deborah Jowitt and Greg Lawrence both speculated that it was due to the all-white New York City Ballet's reservation about having an interracial couple performing a romantic pas de deux.[4]: 222 [6]: 211  Johnson later stated that he believed it was Balanchine who rejected his casting, because the role would have led to him joining the company permanently.[6]: 211  Jowitt also noted that perhaps Robbins was just experimenting with Johnson.[3] Robbins ultimately chose the Dominican-born Francisco Moncion, for his ""animal"" quality.[2]: 222 [3]
Robbins was unsure whether the mirror of the dance studio should be straight front, where the audience would be at, or at the side, right-angled to the audience. He made both versions, and chose to use the straight front version. He explained, ""When the dancers' attention is to the side, it's easier for the audience to watch - they are sort of looking in - but when it's straight front, I think something more arresting happens.""[5] Le Clercq recalled that Robbins completed the ballet quicker than his other works she was familiar with. She also said that she was given very few acting notes from Robbins.[5] The costumes were designed by Irene Sharaff, with the woman in a practice tunic and the man in tights and bare-chested.[1] The set and lighting was by Jean Rosenthal.[7] Robbins showed Rosenthal a drawing of dancers in a studio by Paul Cadmus. She then conceived the idea of using white silk as the wall.[6]: 213  Instead of the French title used in both the poem and the score, Robbins gave the ballet a stripped-down English title, Afternoon of a Faun.[2]: 222 

Choreography and interpretation[edit]
The ballet is set on a summer day, in a dance studio.[5] The man lies asleep on the floor, before a woman enters and starts warming up at the barre. The two then start dancing together, while looking at themselves in the mirror, which is in fact the audience.[5] At the end of the ballet, the man kisses the woman on her cheek. She then leaves, while he returns to his sleep.[1]
Author Amanda Vaill wrote that the ballet is ""deliberately devoid of flashy steps or complicated lifts; spare and poetic'.[2]: 222–223  Moncion noted that the choreography referenced the poem, ""the gestures he used were evocative of Mallarmé's faun - such as pushing through the reeds on a hot humid afternoon.""[7] Le Clercq noted that many of her natural gestures were incorporated to the choreography.[6]: 212 
Author Nancy Reynolds noted that different ballerinas interpret the role differently, some ""do it very literally, very realistically"" and some ""are totally, eerily removed.""[5] Le Clercq stated that her interpretation ""was removed.""[5] Robbins said of the woman, ""I always thought the girl had just washed her hair and just had on new toe shoes and a new clean practice dress and came into the studio to preen and practice.[2]: 222  Moncion noted that Le Clercq's version of the character ""was never innocent"", while some later interpretations are.[5] While the ballet had also been interpreted as a commentary on dancers' narcissism, Robbins was resistant with this idea as ""The mirror is the dancers' work tool.""[6]: 212  Despite the various interpretations, the performance by Le Clercq and Moncion is generally deemed closest to Robbins' ideas.[4]: 255

Afternoon of a Faun premiered on May 14, 1953, at the City Center of Music and Drama.[5] The ballet continues to be a mainstay in the New York City Ballet's repertory.[1] Between 1958 and 1961, Afternoon of a Faun was performed by Ballets: USA, Robbins' company, during their State Department-funded tours. During these tours, John Jones, a black dancer, was paired with Wilma Curley, and later Kay Mazzo, both white women.[8]
Since the 1970s, Afternoon of a Faun has been performed by other ballet companies.[1] The Royal Ballet first performed the ballet in 1971,[9] featuring Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell.[6]: 398  The Australian Ballet made their debut of the ballet in 1978, with Marilyn Rowe and Gary Norman.[10] The Norwegian National Ballet, the Bolshoi Ballet and San Francisco Ballet had their respective company premieres of the ballet in 1991, 2000 and 2006 respectively.[9] Other ballet companies that had danced Afternoon of a Faun include the Paris Opera Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Royal Danish Ballet, La Scala Ballet, National Ballet of Canada and Dance Theatre of Harlem.[1][11] Robbins also allowed Valery Panov to perform the ballet without paying royalty fees.[12]

Videography[edit]
The only footage of Le Clercq and Moncion in Afternoon of a Faun is an amateur silent black-and-white film that was shot from the side.[4]: 225 [3]
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation filmed a performance of Afternoon of a Faun, featuring Le Clercq and Jacques d'Amboise.[4]: 226, 294 
In 1980, the ballet was among several of Robbins' work that was filmed for NBC's series Live from Studio 8H, with Patricia McBride and Ib Andersen performing.[6]: 439 [13]
In 2016, Afternoon of a Faun was included on a  Royal Ballet DVD, danced by Sarah Lamb and Vadim Muntagirov.[14]
In 2020, during the New York City Ballet's digital spring season, which replaced the canceled repertory season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company released an archival video of Sterling Hyltin and Joseph Gordon performing the ballet in 2018.[15]

Ballet written by Tim Rushton
This article is about Tim Rushton's ballet. For musical composition by Debussy, see Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune. For other ballets and uses, see Afternoon of a Faun.

Afternoon of a Faun is a ballet made by Danish Dance Theatre balletmaster Tim Rushton on Johan Kobborg; principal dancer at the Royal Ballet, London; to Debussy's Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune.
The premiere took place in February 2006 at New York City Center as part of the Kings of the Dance gala and subsequently at Orange County Performing Arts Center, Costa Mesa, Calif. Kobborg performed it again in October 2007 as part of City Center's Fall for Dance festival. Both Rushton and Kobburg danced for the Royal Danish Ballet earlier in their careers, Kobburg a principal there as well as in London.
Rushton's setting differs materially from Nijinsky's original in its use of three pools of light produced by beam projectors which appear successively stage center, left and right (center, right and left from the audience's perspective), in which the faun / dancer capers and bathes; it resembles what is known of the original mostly in its costuming.

2005 ballet by Christopher Wheeldon with music by Arvo Pärt

After the Rain is a ballet choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon on New York City Ballet to music of Arvo Pärt, including Tabula Rasa (first movement, Ludus) and Spiegel im Spiegel. The ballet premiered on January 22, 2005, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center.[1] The final pas de deux is commonly performed separately from the remainder of the ballet.[2]


Production[edit]
External videos New York City Ballet MOVES: After The Rain, YouTube video NYC Ballet Presents NEW BEGINNINGS, YouTube video
Background[edit]
After the Rain was commissioned as a part of New York City Ballet's annual New Combinations Evening, which honors the anniversary of George Balanchine’s birth with new ballets. It was the last ballet Wheeldon created for Jock Soto before Soto's retirement in June 2005.[3]

Choreography and music[edit]
The first part of the ballet, set to Arvo Pärt's Tabula Rasa, features three couples.[4] The second part is a pas de deux originated by Soto and Wendy Whelan, which Wheeldon said it was a ""love letter, this poem to both of them as artists.""[2] The music, Pärt's Spiegel im Spiegel, was sent to Wheeldon by a friend after he said he was ""stressed out."" According to Wheeldon, the pas de deux was created within three rehearsals.[2] The female dancer wears flat shoes instead of pointe shoes, which Whelan was initially ""miffed and confused"" about as she had never been off pointe in any New York City Ballet performance, and she later recalled thinking Wheeldon was making her ""walk like an old lady"", but later realized ""exactly the opposite of that. It has so many images that are meaningful to me. It's so simple, and yet there's so much love in it.""[5] Wheeldon encouraged dancers to interpret the pas de deux in their own ways, and said the worst thing dancers could do is to ""act"" it.[2]

Revivals[edit]
The pas de deux has since been danced by companies such as Joffrey Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, The Australian Ballet and The Royal Ballet.[2][6] In 2014, Whelan danced the pas de deux at her final performance with the New York City Ballet, and partnered Craig Hall.[7] The Royal Ballet performed the entirety of After the Rain for the first time in 2016.[8]

1953–1957 ballet by Igor Stravinsky


AgonChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicIgor StravinskyPremiereDecember 1, 1957City Center of Music and Drama, New YorkOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletTypeClassical ballet
Agon is a 22-minute ballet for twelve dancers with music by Igor Stravinsky. It was choreographed by George Balanchine. Stravinsky began composition in December 1953 but was interrupted the next year; he resumed work in 1956 and concluded on April 27, 1957. The music was premiered in Los Angeles at UCLA's Royce Hall on June 17, 1957, conducted by Robert Craft. Stravinsky himself conducted the sessions for the work's first recording the following day on June 18, 1957.[1] Agon was first performed on stage by the New York City Ballet at the City Center of Music and Drama on December 1, 1957.[2]
The composition's long gestation period covers an interesting juncture in Stravinsky's composing career, in which he moved from a diatonic musical idiom to one based on twelve-tone technique; the music of the ballet thus demonstrates a unique symbiosis of musical idioms. The ballet has no story, but consists of a series of dance movements in which various groups of dancers interact in pairs, trios, quartets, etc. A number of the movements are based on 17th-century French court dances – saraband, galliard and bransle. It was danced as part of City Ballet's 1982 Stravinsky Centennial Celebration.
The title of the ballet, Agon, is a Greek word which means “contest”, “protagonist” but also “anguish” or “struggle”.


Form[edit]
Stravinsky laid out the ballet in a duodecimal form, with four large sections each consisting of three dances. A Prelude and two Interludes occur between the large sections, but this does not fundamentally affect the twelve-part design because their function is caesural and compensatory:[3]

I.
Pas-de-quatre (4 male dancers)
Double pas-de-quatre (8 female dancers)
Triple pas-de-quatre (4 male + 8 female dancers)
Prelude
II. (First pas-de-trois: 1 male, 2 female dancers)
Sarabande-step (1 male dancer)
Gaillarde (2 female dancers)
Coda (1 male, 2 female dancers)
Interlude
III. (Second pas-de-trois: 2 male, 1 female dancers)
Bransle simple (2 male dancers)
Bransle gay (1 female dancer)
Bransle double (2 male, 1 female dancers)
Interlude
IV.
Pas-de-deux (1 male, 1 female dancer)
Four Duos (4 male, 4 female dancers)
Four Trios (4 male, 8 female dancers)
Instrumentation[edit]
Agon is scored for a large orchestra consisting of 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 4 trumpets, 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass), harp, piano, mandolin, timpani, tom-tom, xylophone, castanets, and strings.  At no point does the entire orchestra play a tutti.  Each section is scored for a different combination of instruments.

Music[edit]
This was not the first composition in which Stravinsky employed serial techniques, but it was the first in which he used a twelve-tone row, introduced in the second coda, at bar 185. Earlier in the work, Stravinsky had employed a seventeen-tone row, in bars 104–107, and evidence from the sketches suggests a close relationship between these two rows.[4] The Bransle Double is based on a different twelve-tone series, the hexachords of which are treated independently.[5] Those hexachords first appear separately in the Bransle Simple (for two male dancers) and Bransle Gay (for solo female dancer), and are then combined to form a twelve-tone row in the Bransle Double. These three dances together constitute the second pas-de-trois.[6]

Italy[edit]
When Agon was performed in Italy in 1965,[7] Stravinsky was particularly pleased with the performance of mandolinist Giuseppe Anedda. ""Bravo Mandolino!"" shouted Stravinsky at Anedda and caught up with him to congratulate him and shake his hand.[8]

2011 ballet by Christopher Wheeldon
This article is about the 2011 Wheeldon ballet. For the ballet film, see Alice in Wonderland (Kalabis).

Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is a ballet in three acts by Christopher Wheeldon with a scenario by Nicholas Wright, based on Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. It was commissioned by The Royal Ballet, Covent Garden, and the National Ballet of Canada, and had its world premiere on Monday, 28 February 2011. The music by Joby Talbot is the first full-length score (1 hour 40 minutes) for the Royal Ballet in 20 years.[1] It is also the first full-length narrative ballet commissioned by The Royal Ballet since 1995.[2]


Production[edit]
The work is based on Lewis Carroll's 1865 well-known children's book Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Wheeldon was attracted by the physicality of the characters and the perfect central role for a ballerina: ""The Royal Ballet already has a wealth of full-blooded ballets. I wanted to create something lighter and more friendly."" He chose Lauren Cuthbertson for the lead role of Alice as someone who could ""captivate the audience and make them believe in Alice."" As for the music, Talbot explained that he ""wanted to find a new sound, the right timbre for Wonderland."" His orchestral score has a large percussion section and four female voices.[3]
Karen Kain, the artistic director of National Ballet of Canada contacted the Royal Ballet and proposed a co-production after learning about the ballet.[4] The company had the production's North American premiere in 2011, starring Jillian Vanstone.[5]
By 2012, Wheeldon had changed the structure of the ballet so that it consisted of three acts instead of the original two and had inserted an additional pas de deux for Alice and the knave.[6]
The ballet had since been performed by Royal Swedish Ballet in 2016,[7] Royal Danish Ballet in the 2016-17 season,[8] The Australian Ballet in 2017,[9] and by the New National Theatre, Tokyo in June of 2022.[10] Amongst others.[11]

Instrumentation[edit]
Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland is scored for the following orchestra:[12]
Woodwinds: Piccolo I and II, flute I, II and III, oboe I and II, 
oboe d'amore, cor anglais, clarinet I in B♭, II in B♭ and III in B♭,

Characters[edit]

Reviews of premiere[edit]
The premiere was well received by the audience although some reviewers commented on an excessively long first act. Wheeldon's choreography sometimes had to fight for attention, given all the special staging effects. Joby Talbot's exuberant score was credited with providing sophisticated, danceable music with vividly descriptive melodies. Lauren Cuthbertson's performance was said to be ""alert, funny and deliciously un-twee"".[15][16] Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Sarah Crompton commented: ""Wheeldon’s Alice will undoubtedly be hugely popular; it’s colourful, enjoyable fun. But it needed a little more dance and a little less action to take its place alongside those English story ballets the choreographer himself so admires."".[17]

Ballet by George Balanchine
This article is about Balanchine's ballet. For Mendelssohn's composition, see Allegro Brillant (Mendelssohn).


Allegro BrillanteKansas City Ballet's Tempe Ostergren and Anthony Krutzkamp in Allegro BrillanteChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicPyotr Ilyich TchaikovskyPremiereMarch 1, 1956 (1956-03-01)City Center of Music and DramaOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignKarinskaJean RosenthalCreated forMaria TallchiefNicholas MagallanesGenreNeoclassical ballet
Allegro Brillante is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 3. The ballet is danced by a principal couple and a corps de ballet of eight. Balanchine said it ""contains everything I knew about classical ballet.""[1] Allegro Brillante was made for the New York City Ballet, and premiered on March 1, 1956, at the City Center of Music and Drama, with Maria Tallchief and Nicholas Magallanes originating the two principal roles.


Choreography[edit]
Allegro Brillante is danced by a lead couple and a small corps de ballet of eight.[1][2] The ballet is set to Piano Concerto No. 3, which Balanchine found to be ""brisk and declarative but is also deeply contemplative.""[3]
Balanchine said the ballet ""contains everything I knew about classical ballet – in thirteen minutes.""[1] He also wrote, ""I had no narrative idea for the work, only wishing to have the dancers complement the music as best I could.""[3] Maria Tallchief, who originated the lead ballerina role, noted both the ballet's ""expansive Russian romanticism,"" and the fast speed of some of the choreography.[1] Author Nancy Reynolds commented that the ballet ""offers a chance  for virtuoso display and is at the same time 'dancey' and flowing"". She added that while the tempo of the score made the ballet seem ""impossibly difficult"", Balanchine strategically placed exits for the performers so most dancers find their roles easier.[1]

The lead ballerina, according to Balanchine, ""follows the piano in the cadenza"", while her partner and the corps de ballet play the supporting role in conveying ""what I hope is the spirit of the work.""[3] Dancer Violette Verdy described the lead role,There's a lot of strong, broad dancing spaced in very little time. The gestures have to be big, ample, spacious, and they have to look free. Under all that freedom has to be control – the pirouettes, exactness, beats and turns, and, as always with him, the fast work. But if the ballerina is afraid that it will not produce enough of an effect by itself, if she feels she has to compensate by telling the audience that it is hard, a false drama is created. It should be left alone, and one should dance it with passion but with happiness. It's quintessentially Russian in its best possible meaning – a great, romantic, beautiful plastic piece.[1]

Production[edit]
Balanchine made Allegro Brillante at the last minute,[1] after Jerome Robbins canceled the premiere of Suite from ""The Guest"", a revival of his earlier work, because his work on The Concert, another ballet slated to premiere in March 1956 was too time-consuming.[4][5] Balanchine then decided to choreograph to Piano Concerto No. 3. The concerto was Tchaikovsky's last work, as he died less than a month after completing its first movement, Allegro Brillante.[3] Balanchine had previously choreographed Ballet Imperial to Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 2.[3]
The principal roles of the ballet were originated by Maria Tallchief and Nicholas Magallanes. The costumes were designed by Karinska. The original lighting was designed by Jean Rosenthal.[2]

Performances[edit]
Kansas City Ballet dancers in Balanchine's Allegro Brillante
Allegro Brillante premiered on March 1, 1956, at the City Center of Music and Drama.[2] Léon Barzin conducted while Nicholas Kopeikine played the piano.[4] Despite being made as a last minute addition, the New York City Ballet performs Allegro Brillante regularly.[6] Due to its small cast size and short length, the ballet is often placed in the middle of a mixed bill when performed.[1]
Allegro Brillante has been performed by other ballet companies, including Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Royal New Zealand Ballet, Morphoses,[2] American Ballet Theatre,[7] Stuttgart Ballet, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens,[8] National Ballet of Canada, Ballet BC, Royal Winnipeg Ballet,[6] Miami City Ballet,[9] Pennsylvania Ballet,[10] Washington Ballet,[11] Suzanne Farrell Ballet,[12] Dance Theatre of Harlem,[13] Kansas City Ballet,[14] Ballet Arizona,[15] BalletMet[16] and Ballet West.[17] Students of the School of American Ballet, the New York City Ballet's affiliated-school, has performed Allegro Brillante in its annual workshop performance.[18]

Critical reception[edit]
John Martin of the New York Times commented, ""Whether the Balanchine work had been planned previously or was a short-notice assignment does not appear in the quality of the work itself, for though it is certainly not one of his masterpieces, it is put together with all his skills and authority. Its main handicap is its music, which is choreographically unevocative in the extreme.""[4]

Videography[edit]
In 1979, a New York City Ballet performance of Allegro Brillante was televised on PBS's Great Performances. The performance was led by Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins, and the corps de ballet consisted of Renee Estopinal, Lisa de Ribere, Marjorie Spohn, Heather Watts, Tracy Bennett, Stephen Caras, Victor Castelli and Joseph Duell.[19]
In 2020, the New York City Ballet released an archival video of an Allegro Brillante online, as the first program of its digital season, after its repertory season had to be canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The recording features Tiler Peck and Andrew Veyette, and was filmed in 2017.[20]

Ballet by Christopher Wheeldon to music by George Gershwin


An American in ParisChoreographerChristopher WheeldonMusicGeorge GershwinPremiereMay 4, 2005 (2005-05-04)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignHolly HynesAdrianne LobelNatasha Katz
An American in Paris is a one-act ballet choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon, to the eponymous music by George Gershwin, costumes designed by Holly Hynes, sets designed by Adrianne Lobel and lighting designed by Natasha Katz. The ballet premiered on May 4, 2005, at the New York State Theater. Wheeldon later directed and choreographed the musical adaptation of the An American in Paris film.

Production[edit]
Choreographer Christopher Wheeldon was first invited to choreograph the musical version of the film An American in Paris, though the project was abandoned. Wheeldon, who said George Gershwin's orchestral piece of the same name was ""a great piece of classical music"" in addition to being a film score, decided to make a ballet version instead.[1]
On the choreography, Wheeldon said he wanted to create a more ""balleticize"" version with his own choreography, as the film's choreography is simple and uninteresting, but the cinematography made the film work on screen. He said he considered to have one of the dancers be off pointe, but went against it as it is a ballet.[1] The set, designed by Adrianne Lobel,[2] was inspired by Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso.[3] Holly Hynes and Natasha Katz were brought in to design costumes and lighting respectively.[4]
An American in Paris premiered on May 4, 2005, at the New York State Theater, the three lead roles were originated by Carla Körbes, Jenifer Ringer and Damian Woetzel, and Andrea Quinn conducted the orchestra. The ballet received mixed reviews.[5] The reviewer for The New York Times wrote that Wheeldon was ""clever in capturing idealized Paris street life"" though ""the dance never quite coheres.""[2] Another Times reviewer wrote that the scenes were unmemorable but ""well crafted that the overall result is amiable entertainment.""[5] Wheeldon later claimed he ""never felt entirely happy"" with the ballet.[3]

Musical[edit]
Further information: An American in Paris (musical)
Wheeldon later went on to direct and choreograph musical adaptation of the An American in Paris film, which was Wheeldon's directorial debut.[3] The musical opened at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris in 2014,[6] Palace Theatre, Broadway in 2015,[7] and Dominion Theatre, West End in 2017.[8] NYCB principal dancer Robert Fairchild and Royal Ballet's Leanne Cope originated the roles Jerry Mulligan and Lise Dassin respectively. Wheeldon was awarded the Tony Award for Best Choreography.[9]

El amor brujo ([el aˈmoɾ ˈbɾu.xo], ""Love, the sorcerer"") is a ballet by Manuel de Falla to a libretto by María de la O Lejárraga García, although for years it was attributed to her husband Gregorio Martínez Sierra. It exists in three versions as well as a piano suite drawn from four of its movements. Andalusian in character, its music includes the celebrated Danza ritual del fuego (Ritual Fire Dance), the Canción del fuego fatuo (Song of the Will-o'-the-Wisp) and the Danza del terror. Its songs use the Andalusian Spanish dialectal modality.


Versions and performance history[edit]
Gitanería (1915)[edit]
El amor brujo was commissioned in 1914 as a gitanería, or danced gypsy entertainment, dedicated to the flamenco dancer and cantaora Pastora Imperio. It was finished the next year but its premiere, on 15 April at the Teatro Lara in Madrid, proved unsuccessful. This version, in two scenes, is for dancers and actors and is scored for cantaora voice and chamber ensemble. 

First revised version (1916)[edit]
Falla then revised the ballet by removing its spoken dialogue, replacing the cantaora part with three songs for mezzo-soprano and enlarging the accompaniment for sextet and small orchestra. The plot was slightly changed as well.[1] This more concise version, still in two scenes, was played on 12 March 1916 by members of the Madrid Symphony Orchestra under Enrique Fernández Arbós. But it was modified several times, starting the following year when Fernández Arbós proposed a production at the Teatro Real. 

Ballet pantomímico (1924)[edit]
By 1924 Falla had evolved El amor brujo into the one-act ballet pantomímico best known today, mainly by enlarging its orchestration. This was published by Chester the next year and given in Paris. It premiered in America on 17 March 1927 at Philadelphia's Metropolitan Opera House with Alexander Smallens conducting the Philadelphia Civic Opera Company and mezzo-soprano soloist Kathryn Noll. 

Suite of excerpts for piano (1922)[edit]
Before completing the published ballet, Falla made a suite for piano comprising four of the movements: Pantomima, Danza del terror, Romance del pescador and Danza ritual del fuego. This is G69 in the published works.

Synopsis[edit]
El amor brujo is the story of an Andalusian gypsy woman called Candela. Although her affection is for a man named Carmelo, as a girl she was promised to be married to another man (then a boy). After many years Candela's husband has died (at the hands of the husband of a woman named Lucia), but he continues to haunt his wife.
The entire village knows about the haunting, but still brands Candela as crazy because she dances every night with her husband’s ghost (""Danza del terror""). Candela, now a widow, is free to establish a relationship with Carmelo, but continues to be haunted by her husband's ghost.
After a conversation with other women of the village, Candela finally comes to realise that her husband was unfaithful to her, despite all her efforts to make their marriage work; her husband's lover is revealed to have been Lucia.
Candela and Carmelo get advice that a ritual dance is necessary to cast the ghost off (""Danza ritual del fuego""), but it does not work. The ghost is still obsessed with Candela's soul.
Candela manages to trick Lucía to come that night, with the excuse of hooking her up with Carmelo. As she turns up, the nightly ritual of Candela's dance with her husband's ghost begins, but at the last moment Candela moves away from her husband and Lucía is taken away by her now dead lover (""Danza del juego de amor"").
Dawn breaks, Candela and Carmelo are now truly free to enjoy their love.

Films[edit]
In 1967 Francisco Rovira Beleta directed a film version. It was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, but lost to Jiří Menzel's Closely Observed Trains. However, it won the ""National Syndicate of Spectacle, Spain"" award.
In 1986, Spanish director Carlos Saura directed El amor brujo based on the ballet, starring and choreographed by Antonio Gades. It was the third in his trilogy of dance films, following Bodas de sangre (Blood Wedding) and Carmen. The film filled out the story with spoken dialogue, but nevertheless used the entire score of the ballet, along with additional songs and dances performed by characters in the film. The Orquesta Nacional de España was conducted by Jesús López-Cobos, and the cante jondo singer heard on the soundtrack was Rocío Jurado. A soundtrack album, now out of print, was issued by EMI.

Music[edit]
The section ""Cancion del Fuego Fatuo"" was recorded in 1960 by jazz musician Miles Davis as ""Will O' the Wisp"" in an arrangement by Gil Evans for their album Sketches of Spain.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Anastasia is a ballet created by Kenneth MacMillan. The first version in one act was premiered in 1967 by the Deutsche Oper Ballet. In 1971 MacMillan expanded the work to three acts for the Royal Ballet; the original one-act version became the final act of the 1971 work.[1]
The 1967 version uses Bohuslav Martinů's Symphony No. 6 (1953) and untitled electronic music by Fritz Winckel and Rüdiger Rüfer. The three-act version also used Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 1 and Symphony No. 3.[1]
The ballet is based on the story of Anna Anderson, who purported to be the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia. After MacMillan's death, DNA tests showed that Anderson was unrelated to the Russian imperial family, but at the time the ballet was created many, including MacMillan, were inclined to accept that she might be the lost Grand Duchess.[2] Anderson was confined for a time to a mental institution in Berlin in 1920. The 1967 ballet depicts her there, painfully attempting to recover her memory. The first two acts of the 1971 version show Anastasia's life (or Anderson's mental image of it) in her privileged surroundings before the Russian Revolution. MacMillan chose Tchaikovsky's music for these acts, to provide a dramatic contrast with the musique concrète and the edgy Martinů score in the third act.[3]
The first performance of the single-act version was given at the Deutsche Oper, Berlin on 25 June 1967. The title role of Anastasia/Anderson was danced by Lynn Seymour. The three-act version was premiered by the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 22 July 1971. Barry Kay designed costumes and scenery for both productions.[4][5] After MacMillan's death the ballet was revived, with minor changes, under the supervision of his widow Deborah MacMillan in May 1996.[6] New costumes and scenery were designed by Bob Crowley. In that, and later revivals, the title role was performed by Viviana Durante, Leanne Benjamin, Gillian Revie, Mara Galeazzi, Lauren Cuthbertson, Laura Morera, and Natalia Osipova.[7]

The ballet was made for the New York City Ballet's Tchaikovsky Festival, and premiered on June 4, 1981, at the New York State Theater, originated by Darci Kistler and Ib Andersen.

Choreography[edit]
Andantino is a pas de deux set to the second movement of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 1.[1] It does not follow the structure of a classical pas de deux, and has neither solos nor the coda.[1] New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff and writer Amanda Vaill both compared its choreography to figure skating.[1][2] Kisselgoff also commented, ""There's more than a hint of a romantic relationship and embraces.""[1]

Production[edit]
Andantino was created for the New York City Ballet's Tchaikovsky Festival, and was Robbins' first ballet to Tchaikovsky's music.[3] The festival was conceived by George Balanchine.[4] Robbins, however, was not interested in choreographing to Tchaikovsky's works.[5] He nevertheless choreographed three ballets for the festival.[4] He later recalled, ""Two months before the Tchaikovsky festival, I thought, I don't like Tchaikovsky ... Why should I do Tchaikovsky? Because Mr. Balanchine wants me to do Tchaikovsky? But you don't necessarily have to enjoy doing something for it to be good.""[4]
The ballet was created on Darci Kistler, a fifteen-year-old who was just handpicked by Balanchine to join the company from the School of American Ballet, and Ib Andersen, a new principal dancer who was previously a member of the Royal Danish Ballet.[2] The costumes were designed by Ben Benson.[3] The lighting was designed by Ronald Bates,[6] who was also the stage manager.[2]
Andantino was among the ballets performed on the opening night of the Tchaikovsky Festival. Robbins had planned Andantino for a ""special place in the program"", but found out it would be included on that day through the presentation order, which was changed by Balanchine. It resulted in the only serious clash between Robbins and Balanchine, though Balanchine apologized the following day.[2][4] It premiered under the title Pas de Deux, but was renamed to its current title later that year.[7]

Performances[edit]
Andantino premiered on June 4, 1981, at the New York State Theater.[6] It was included in New York City Ballet's Jerome Robbins Celebration, held in honor of the 90th anniversary of Robbins' birth and 10th anniversary of his death.[8] In 2018, for Robbins' centenary, it was performed by New York City Ballet members at Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival.[9]

Critical reception[edit]
Following the premiere, Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times commented that although the ballet was Robbins' first ballet to Tchaikovsky's music, he ""managed to create a major work in the process.""[3]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Les Animaux modèlesSerge Lifar and Yvette Chauviré in the original 1942 productionChoreographerSerge LifarMusicFrancis PoulencBased onFables of Jean de La FontainePremiere8 August 1942Paris Opera, Paris
Les Animaux modèles, FP 111, is a ballet dating from 1940 to 1942 with music by Francis Poulenc. It was the third and final ballet that he composed and was staged at the Paris Opéra in 1942, with choreography by Serge Lifar, who also danced in the 1942 premiere. The themes of the ballet are drawn from the Fables of Jean de La Fontaine.


History[edit]
The sections of the ballet are based on stories from Jean de La Fontaine's Fables.[1] These tales had inspired works by French composers from Lully to Gounod, Offenbach and Saint-Saëns.[2] Its title was provided by the poet Paul Eluard, as he had done for several other works by Poulenc at his request.[3]
Poulenc began work on his ballet in 1940, completing a piano score in September 1941 and orchestrating it between October 1941 and June 1942.[2] He wrote his own scenario for the ballet, making the various animals more human-like than usual.[2] In his words, ""The grasshopper has become an ageing ballerina, the ant an old provincial housemaid, the amorous lion a pimp, Death an elegant woman – a kind of duchess with a mask"".[4] The commentator Gérald Hugon observes:

[D]ifferent musical styles are brought together in delightful fashion – passionate ""grand piano"" writing set against the ""bad boy's"" waltz-java in Le Lion amoureux, the verve of the Offenbachian can-can in L'Homme entre deux âges et ses deux maîtresses, Mussorgskyan turns of phrase in La Mort et le Bûcheron and a deliberate borrowing from Paganini's Caprice No. 24 in Les Deux Coqs.[5]
Hugon comments that all these influences are absorbed by Poulenc and turned into his own style.[5] At the time of the premiere, Poulenc's friend and colleague Arthur Honegger wrote that ""the influences that have worked upon him – Chabrier, Satie, Stravinsky – are now completely assimilated. Listening to his music you think – it's Poulenc.""[6]
The company for the premiere was headed by Serge Lifar (who also choreographed the work) and Yvette Chauviré. Paris was under Nazi occupation, and the many German officers in the audience failed to spot the composer's defiant incorporation of the anti-German song ""Vous n'aurez pas l'Alsace et la Lorraine"" in his score.[2][7] Poulenc later reduced the full score to a shorter orchestral suite.[5]
Poulenc dedicated the ballet to the memory of his childhood friend Raymonde Linossier (1897-1930).[8]

Antique Epigraphs is a ballet made on New York City Ballet by ballet master Jerome Robbins to an orchestrated version of Debussy's Six épigraphes antiques, L131, for piano, four hands, from 1914:

“Pour invoquer Pan, dieu du vent d'été”
“Pour un tombeau sans nom”
“Pour que la nuit soit propice”
“Pour la danseuse aux crotales”
“Pour l'égyptienne”
“Pour remercier la pluie au matin”
and his Syrinx, L129, a melody for unaccompanied flute from 1913. Six épigraphes antiques were originally written to accompany Pierre Louys' Les Chansons de Bilitis, prose poetry which was purported to be a translation of freshly discovered autobiographical verse by a lover and contemporary of Sappho. The premiere took place on February 2, 1984, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, with costumes by Florence Klotz and lighting by Jennifer Tipton.

1927–1928 ballet by Igor Stravinsky
This article is about Igor Stravinsky's 1928 ballet. For the Greek god, see Apollo. For other uses, see Apollo (disambiguation).

Apollo (originally Apollon musagète and variously known as Apollo musagetes, Apolo Musageta, and Apollo, Leader of the Muses) is a neoclassical ballet in two tableaux composed between 1927 and 1928 by Igor Stravinsky. It was choreographed in 1928 by twenty-four-year-old George Balanchine, with the composer contributing the libretto. The scenery and costumes were designed by André Bauchant, with new costumes by Coco Chanel in 1929. The scenery was executed by Alexander Shervashidze, with costumes under the direction of Mme. A. Youkine. The American patron of the arts Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge had commissioned the ballet in 1927 for a festival of contemporary music to be held the following year at the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C.
The story centres on Apollo, the Greek god of music, who is visited by three Muses: Terpsichore, muse of dance and song; Polyhymnia, muse of mime; and Calliope, muse of poetry. The ballet takes Classical antiquity as its subject, though its plot suggests a contemporary situation. It is concerned with the reinvention of tradition, since its inspiration is Baroque, Classical, or even post-baroque/rococo/galant.
It is scored for chamber orchestra of 34 string instruments (8.8.6.8.4).


Music[edit]
Stravinsky began composing Apollo on 16 July 1927 and completed the score on 9 January 1928. He composed for a refined instrumental force, a string orchestra of 34 instrumentalists: 8 first violins, 8 second violins, 6 violas, 4 first cellos, 4 second cellos and 4 double basses.
The commission from the Library of Congress and underwritten by Mrs. Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge paid him $1,000 for the piece, which was required to use only six dancers, require a small orchestra, and last no more than half an hour, but allowed him free choice of subject. Stravinsky had been thinking of writing a ballet on an episode in Greek mythology for some time and decided to make Apollo, leader of the muses, its central figure while reducing the number of muses from nine to three. They were Terpsichore, personifying the rhythm of poetry and the eloquence of gesture as embodied in the dance; Calliope, combining poetry and rhythm; and Polyhymnia, representing mime. Stravinsky explained the original title Apollon Musagète to mean ""Apollo, Leader of the Muses"".
Stravinsky wrote for a homogeneous ensemble of bowed string instruments, substituting contrasts in dynamics for the contrasts in timbre he employed in Pulcinella. The ballet takes its inspiration from the grand tradition of French 17th- and 18th-century music, in particular that of Lully, a source Stravinsky returned to when composing Agon in 1957. The prologue begins with dotted rhythms in the style of a French overture. The work relies on a basic rhythmic cell, presented at the beginning of the work, which Stravinsky transforms by subdivisions of successive values that become increasingly complex. Stravinsky revised the score slightly in 1947. In 1963, he indicated he intended to make further changes, particularly with respect to double-dotting many of the dotted-rhythm passages in Baroque style.[1]

Ballet[edit]
Falco Kapuste as Apollo
The first ballet version of Stravinsky's Apollon musagète, commissioned especially for the Washington festival, premiered on 27 April 1928 with choreography by Adolph Bolm, who also danced the role of Apollo. Adolph Bolm put together a company of dancers for the premiere in a country which, at that time, lacked a readily available source of classically trained dancers. Ruth Page, Berenice Holmes (Gene Kelly's ballet teacher), and Elise Reiman were the three Muses and Hans Kindler conducted. Stravinsky took no interest in the U.S. performance, and Bolm's choreography is now practically forgotten.[2]
He had reserved the European rights to the score for Sergei Diaghilev, whose Ballets Russes production, choreographed by the 24-year-old Balanchine, opened at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt in Paris on 12 June 1928. Stravinsky conducted the performance. The concertmaster was Marcel Darrieux.[3]
In accordance with Stravinsky's wishes, the style of dancing was essentially classical, and Stravinsky thought of ""Apollon musagète"" as a ballet blanc, that is, costumed in traditional minimal white. Balanchine later said that when he heard Stravinsky's music all he could see was pristine white.[4] The clarity, calm, even serenity of the music makes it seem infinitely remote from the colorful excitement of Stravinsky's earlier ballets. The avoidance of any conflict in the scenario, of any narrative, psychological or expressive intent, was further matched by monochrome costumes for the dancers and the absence of elaborate scenery on stage.[5]
Scenery and costumes for Balanchine's production were by French artist André Bauchant. Coco Chanel provided new costumes in 1929. Apollo wore a reworked toga with a diagonal cut, a belt, and laced up sandals. The Muses wore traditional tutus. The decoration was baroque: two large sets, with some rocks and Apollo's chariot.
The scenario involved the birth of Apollo, his interactions with the three Muses, Calliope (poetry), Polyhymnia (mime) and Terpsichore (dance and song), and his ascent as a god to Mount Parnassus. The original cast included Serge Lifar as Apollo, Alice Nikitina as Terpsichore (alternating with Alexandra Danilova), Lubov Tchernicheva as Calliope, Felia Doubrovska as Polyhymnia and Sophie Orlova as Leto, mother of Apollo.[6]
For a revival with Mikhail Baryshnikov as Apollo in 1979, he also omitted Apollo's first variation and re-choreographed the ballet's ending. This revision concluded not with Apollo's ascent to Mount Parnassus but rather with moving the ""peacock"" tableau of the Muses in arabesques of ascending height beside Apollo, which originally happened slightly earlier, to the final pose. In the 1980 staging for the New York City Ballet, Apollo's first variation was restored.
Suzanne Farrell restored the birth scene for her company in 2001, as did Arthur Mitchell for his Dance Theatre of Harlem performance at Symphony Space's Wall to Wall Balanchine in conjunction with City Ballet's Balanchine centennial and Iain Webb for The Sarasota Ballet's Tribute to Nureyev performance in February 2015 (staged by Sandra Jennings).

Form[edit]
The characters are Apollo and three muses: Calliope, the muse of poetry; Polyhymnia, the muse of rhetoric; and Terpsichore, the muse of dance. The theme is: Apollon musagetes instructs the muses in their arts and leads them to Parnassus. The ballet is divided into two tableaux:

First tableau
Prologue: The Birth of Apollo
Second tableau
Variation of Apollo
Pas d'action (Apollo and the Three Muses)
Variation of Calliope (the Alexandrine)
Variation of Polyhymnia
Variation of Terpsichore
Second Variation of Apollo
Pas de deux
Coda
Apotheosis
Other premieres[edit]
American Ballet Theatre first premiered the ballet in 1943 in New York City at the Metropolitan Opera House.[7]
The New York City Ballet premiere was 15 November 1951, at City Center of Music and Drama, New York.[8]
The Royal Ballet premiere was on 15 November 1966, with Donald MacLeary as Apollo, Svetlana Beriosova as Terpsichore, Monica Mason as Polyhymnia and Georgina Parkinson as Calliope.[9]
The first performance of the Balanchine work in Australia was by the Australian Ballet on 3 May 1991, when it was staged for the company by Karin von Aroldingen, former leading artist of New York City Ballet. On opening night, Steven Heathcote danced the role of Apollo with Justine Miles as Calliope, Miranda Coney as Polyhymnia and Lisa Pavane as Terpsichore.[10]
First performance by Birmingham Royal Ballet was on 24 September 2003 at the Birmingham Hippodrome.[citation needed]
The Stravinsky score was used by Margaret Scott in creating her version of Apollon Musagete for the Ballet Guild in 1951, by Charles Lisner in his 1962 version for the Queensland Ballet, and by Robin Grove in his 1967 production for the Victorian Ballet Company.[10]
The first performance of the Balanchine work in South America was in Peru by the Ballet Nacional del Peru on September 8, 2017. It was staged for the company by Elyse Borne, former soloist of New York City Ballet who had performed the role of Polyhymnia herself under Balanchine's staging.

Further information[edit]
Balanchine shortened the title to Apollo in the 1950s, which Stravinsky himself came to prefer. Despite the popularly considered Balanchine-Stravinsky Greek link due to Balanchine's later work with Stravinsky scores in Orpheus and Agon, the music for Apollo was commissioned by the Library of Congress. Orpheus may be considered a sequel to Apollo but Agon is a formal plotless ballet whose title in Greek evokes a contest.[12]

Recordings[edit]
In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performing arts, New York City Ballet released a recording featuring Taylor Stanley, Tiler Peck, Brittany Pollack, and Indiana Woodward, filmed in 2019.[13]

Appalachian Spring is a ballet created by the American composer Aaron Copland and the choreographer Martha Graham, later arranged as an orchestral work. Commissioned by Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, Copland composed the ballet for Graham; the original choreography was by Graham, with costumes by Edythe Gilfond and sets by Isamu Noguchi. The music was well-received at the 1944 premiere, earning Copland the Pulitzer Prize for Music after the ballet's 1945 United States tour. The orchestral suite composed in 1945 was played that year by many symphony orchestras; the suite is among Copland's best-known works, and the ballet remains essential in the Martha Graham Dance Company repertoire.
Graham was known for creating the ""Graham technique"" of dance; in the 1930s, she began commissioning scores from various composers, often related to American history and culture. Around the same time, Copland incorporated relatable and accessible musical characteristics of the Americana style to increase his music's appeal to the general public; he first implemented this in earlier ballets like Billy the Kid and Rodeo. The initial scenario for Appalachian Spring devised by Graham was revised many times by both her and Copland; the title characters' names were changed numerous times and other characters from the early revisions were cut in the final production. Originally orchestrated for a thirteen-piece chamber orchestra, the score was arranged into various suites by Copland for different purposes; the original ballet featured eight episodes, three of which were cut in the well-known orchestral suite.
The ballet takes place in a small settlement in 19th-century Pennsylvania. There are four main characters: the Bride, the Husbandman, the Pioneer Woman, and the Revivalist; the last is accompanied by four Followers.[a] Appalachian Spring follows the Bride and the Husbandman as they get married and celebrate with the community. Themes of war are present throughout the story; it is suggested that the Husbandman leaves for war, causing worry and anxiety among the community. Shaker themes also influenced the ballet, notably in the music, where Copland incorporated a theme and variations on the common Shaker tune ""Simple Gifts"".


History[edit]
Background[edit]
During the late 1920s and early 1930s, Aaron Copland spent much of his time promoting American composers and music.[1] Copland's compositions during this time turned jazzy and dissonant,[2][3] a style that interested few.[1] During the Great Depression, his left-wing political stances strengthened, motivated by addressing the concerns of ordinary people.[4][1][5] This initiated the idea of music that was simple and accessible enough to be liked by the general public,[1][6] a concept pioneered in his opera for children The Second Hurricane (1937) and his greatly successful ballet El Salón México (1936).[1][7][8] This ""ordinary music"" idea is present in Appalachian Spring; Copland remarked in a 1980 interview that the music was ""plain, singing, comparatively uncomplicated and slightly folksy. Direct and approachable"".[9] The composer solidified his populist and Americana style with ballets like Billy the Kid (1938) and Rodeo (1942),[10][11] both of which used cowboy songs and fit with the popular stereotypes about the Wild West.[11][12] In addition, Lincoln Portrait (1942) and Fanfare for the Common Man (1942) received widespread acclaim for their American themes, distinguishing Copland's versatility as a composer.[13]
Martha Graham was a modern dancer and choreographer best known for creating the ""Graham technique"" of dance.[14][15] The Martha Graham Dance Company originally consisted of only women due to Graham's feminism; this played a key role in productions like American Document (1938), which mixed important moments in American history with Native American themes and American folklore.[16] In the 1930s, she began commissioning scores from various composers; the scenarios often involved American history and culture.[14]

Commission and writing[edit]
In 1941, Graham proposed to Copland a dark ballet about the Greek mythology figure Medea; despite being a great admirer of Graham, he declined.[17] The following year, Erick Hawkins, the chief male dancer in Graham's dance company, convinced the music patron Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge to commission a ballet from Copland for Graham's company; Copland happily accepted the offer.[18] Graham first proposed a scenario titled ""Daughter of Colchis"", which was inspired by the story of Medea but set in 19th-century New England. Copland found it ""too severe"", and the idea was given to another Coolidge commissionee, Carlos Chávez.[17] In May 1943, Graham sent Copland a scenario titled ""House of Victory"", about a newlywed couple in a small 19th-century Pennsylvania settlement. Copland revised the scenario before composing the music, though his occupation with the score for The North Star caused the beginning of his work to be delayed.[17][19][20]
Per Coolidge's commission, the orchestra was to be no bigger than twelve musicians.[17] Copland originally planned to orchestrate it for double string quartet and piano, but later decided to add a double bass, flute, clarinet, and bassoon, a scoring similar to Chávez's work.[21] During the 1940s, Copland spent much of his time on the West Coast scoring Hollywood films; as a result, he composed the music for Appalachian Spring far from Graham's East Coast-based work.[22][23][24] Since he could not meet with Graham, he relied greatly on the various scenarios sent to him. In total, Copland was sent three scripts: the original ""House of Victory"", and two revisions titled ""Name"".[21][25] In composing the music, he drew from all three scripts to devise his own scenario, which Graham planned around as she received various drafts of the score.[26] Copland used the working title ""Ballet for Martha"" during the composition process.[27]
The original scenario, ""House of Victory"", used characters based on common American archetypes and was set during the Civil War, but also drew from Greek mythology and French poetry.[b][29][30] Four main characters were present: the Mother, who represents the preindustrial American; the Daughter, a brave pioneer; the Citizen, a smart civil rights advocate who marries the Daughter; and the Fugitive, who embodies the slave in the Civil War.[a][29][31][32] Graham based some of the ballet on her own experiences. She grew up in small-town Pennsylvania, and later wrote that the Mother was based on her own grandmother.[31][33] Other characters include the Younger Sister, Two Children, and Neighbors.[34][31] In the later revisions, a new character was added: a Native American girl to represent the land, associated with the story of Pocahontas. The Native American girl was meant to act as a theatrical device, interacting with everyone in the ballet without being acknowledged, but the idea was scrapped in Copland's final composition.[19][31][35] Additionally, Graham planned for the Mother to speak excerpts from the Book of Genesis throughout, ""not in a religious sense so much as in a poetic sense"";[36] this too was cut by the premiere.[37]
The final scenario featured eight episodes:[c]

Prologue: Graham did not want this opening episode to be long; she wanted it to have ""a sense of simple celebration"". As the lights went up, the Mother observed her land.[36]
Eden Valley: The Daughter and the Citizen dance together in a ""duet of courtship"".[36]
Wedding Day: Graham divided this episode into two parts. The first opens with a dance between the Younger Sister and the Two Children. The Citizen exhibits his strength before carrying the Daughter into the couple's new home. In the second part, the Daughter and the Citizen dance a love scene in the home, while those outside celebrate in an ""old fashion charivari"".[36]
Interlude: This episode depicts daily life in the town during spring planting.[36]
Fear in the Night: The central conflict of the ballet begins in this episode. The Fugitive enters with an ""awkward"" and ""tragic"" solo, bringing forth the fear and suffering of the Civil War.[36][38]
Day of Wrath: This episode was intended to represent the tragedies of war, accompanied by music reminiscent of the Civil War. The Citizen dances a violent solo ""reminiscent of Harper's Ferry and John Brown"" while the Two Children play a war game.[39][40]
Moment of Crisis: The women of the town gather, their behavior suggesting ""a barely suppressed hysteria"".[41]
The Lord's Day: The final scene was intended to depict ""Sabbath in a small town"". The Daughter and the Citizen perform a love duet outside the home, and the rest of the community attends a revival meeting.[41][42]
The ""House of Victory"" script included an extra episode after the ""Interlude"" presenting scenes from Uncle Tom's Cabin, strengthening the ballet's connection to the Civil War; but, upon Copland's persuasion, Graham cut the episode from the revisions.[34][41] In addition, the original script used a different final scene, where the Daughter and the Citizen reunite in the home. The second script ended with ""the town settling down for the night"" and the Daughter standing at the fence just before the curtain falls. The third script put forth ""The Lord's Day"" as it would stand in the final scenario.[41]
Graham received half of the score in January 1944 and began work on the choreography.[43] Copland completed the condensed score in June 1944, and the orchestration was finished in August.[21] The premiere was originally set to take place at the Library of Congress on October 30, 1943, which was Coolidge's birthday. By May 1943, Copland had not begun composing the ballet, and given the further problems introduced by World War II, the premiere was postponed to early 1944.[17] Despite a new December 1943 deadline for the music, a completed score was still not in view, and the premiere was pushed to late 1944.[21]

Production[edit]
Isamu Noguchi's set
Shortly before the premiere, Graham decided upon the title ""Appalachian Spring"".[d] It was taken from the cycle of poems The Bridge[e] by Hart Crane, an American poet also seeking to create unique American art;[42][45] one of the poems, titled Powhatan's Daughter, contained the line ""O Appalachian Spring!""[42][46] Crane's work was a great inspiration to Graham while she wrote the various scripts.[45][47]
To construct the set, Graham hired Isamu Noguchi, a sculptor and common collaborator with the company. While planning, she took Noguchi to the Museum of Modern Art and showed him Alberto Giacometti's sculpture The Palace at 4 a.m.[f] as a reference for what she wanted:[48] something depicting the inside and outside of a house without actually dividing it, a sort of blurred mix. Noguchi's use of an outline of a house served as a metaphor for the general idea of the work being about ""the bone structure of a people's living"".[49][50] The set featured the outline of a house, part of a porch with a ledge, a rocking chair, a small fence, and a tree stump (serving as the Revivalist's pulpit).[30][51] Edythe Gilfond created the costumes and Jean Rosenthal designed the lighting.[52][53][54]
Many changes were made to the scenario after the score was finished. The Younger Sister, the Two Children, and the Neighbors were all cut, and the rest of the cast was renamed: the Daughter to the Bride; the Citizen to the Husbandman; the Mother to the Pioneer Woman; and the Fugitive to the Revivalist.[g][19][55] Four Followers of the Revivalist were added to the cast for a total of nine dancers in the ballet.[55] The choreography often deviated from both the final scenario and Copland's annotations in the score; for example, the closing love duet between the Bride and the Husbandman became a dance between the Revivalist and his four Followers.[56] Regardless, Copland was not irritated by this, later commenting, ""That kind of decision is the choreographer's, and it doesn’t bother me a bit, especially when it works.""[57] The cast at the premiere starred Graham as the Bride, Hawkins as the Husbandman, May O'Donnell as the Pioneer Woman, and Merce Cunningham as the Revivalist.[58] Yuriko, Pearl Lang, Nina Fonaroff, and Marjorie Mazia danced the Revivalist's followers.[59][60]
Graham's performance was young and lively, which critics praised.[61][62] On the contrary, Hawkins was stiffer, exhibiting a masculinity and suppleness that stuck in the role with future performers. Cunningham, who choreographed his own solo during ""Fear of the Night"", was instructed to display great anger; Graham later described the role to a new dancer as being ""ninety-nine percent sex and one percent religion: a real popular spellbinder, a magnetic man who had power over women.""[61] Graham's vision for the four Followers was spontaneity; they would remain perfectly still until their time came, and when they did dance, it would be with energy and focus. Agnes de Mille, fellow choreographer and close friend of Graham's, pointed out that many subsequent productions featured cute and perky Followers, but that this was not Graham's original intention.[63] Much of the contrast between female and male characters was intentional. While the female characters remained bouncy and light, the male characters were stiff and took up much space.[64]
The press described the choreography as simple and precise.[65][66][67] Despite being set during such a scenario, the choreography does not explicitly depict a wedding; rather, the dance expresses the emotions of individual characters.[52] This non-literal plot allowed for free emotional interpretation by the audience.[68] The Bride's movements featured quick patterns that stayed within an imaginary box around her. This contrasted with the Revivalist's strict posture and the flowing movements of the Pioneer Woman.[69] One reviewer pointed out the solitude of the characters and its manifestation in their movements, writing, ""The separateness of still figures... which their poses emphasize, suggests that people who live in these hills are accustomed to spending much of their time alone.""[70]

Initial run and reception[edit]
Appalachian Spring premiered on October 30, 1944, at the Coolidge Auditorium, conducted by Louis Horst, the music director of the company.[h][72][73] The premiere was the closing concert of a four-day chamber music festival honoring Coolidge's 80th birthday.[74][75] Copland had not attended any of the rehearsals at Graham's request, first seeing the full performance a day before the premiere.[76][26] The ballet was well-received by critics and the public.[58][71][77] The New York Times critic John Martin wrote of the music, ""Aaron Copland has written a score of fresh and singing beauty. It is, on its surface, a piece of early Americana, but in reality it is a celebration of the human spirit.""[78] The Dance Observer critic Robert Sabin wrote of the story, ""Appalachian Spring works outward into the basic experiences of people living together, love, religious belief, marriage, children, work and human society.""[71] The dance was also praised; Martin continued, ""There is throughout the work a very moving sense of the future, of the fine and simple idealism which animates the highest human motives.""[78] The dance critic Walter Terry praised Graham in particular, writing in 1953, ""Miss Graham brought to the role a wonderful radiance which dominated the entire ballet.""[79] The group of dancers was commended for being well-trained and enthusiastic.[65] Copland's idea for ordinary music continued to be popular; one reviewer commented that it was ""comprehensible even to the bored businessman"".[34] Copland himself had a modest opinion of the premiere; a week later, he wrote in a letter: ""People seemed to like it so I guess it was all right.""[80]
The great demand for tickets caused a repeat of the October 30 program to occur the following evening.[81] Shortly after the premiere, the Graham Company took Appalachian Spring on tour across the United States with the same cast. The debut show of the tour took place in Washington, D.C., on January 23, 1945.[58][82] The New York premiere of the ballet occurred days after Victory in Europe Day; the ballet's American populist themes, combined with Copland winning the Pulitzer Prize for Music in the same week, caused this show to be even more successful.[58][83][84] After every performance sold out, the New York run was extended by one night.[85]

Later performances[edit]
Appalachian Spring remains an essential production in the Martha Graham Dance Company repertoire.[52][86] Due to the high cost of licensing, the ballet was not performed by another company until 1998, when the Colorado Ballet staged it led by artistic director Martin Fredmann.[87] In 2013, the Baltimore School for the Arts put on a production for the ""Appalachian Spring Festival"" in association with the Graham Company, which featured a complete performance of the ballet and various art exhibits. It marked the first time a non-professional company was granted permission from the Martha Graham Center to perform the ballet.[88] Appalachian Spring has been performed by numerous dance companies since, including the Onium Ballet Project in Hawaii,[89] the Nashville Ballet in Tennessee,[90] Dance Kaleidoscope in Indiana,[91] and the Sarasota Ballet in Florida.[92]
Many consider Appalachian Spring to be one of Copland's best and most famous works;[76][93] it holds equal notability in the Graham company's repertoire.[94][95] The critic Terry Teachout wrote, ""It is probably the greatest piece of classical music composed by an American. Certainly the greatest dance score composed by an American, completely comparable in quality to the great ballets of Tchaikovsky or Stravinsky. All that is best about mid-century American music is in this piece.""[76] In addition, the ballet was essential to the development of modern American ballet;[96] it and Copland's other Americana works represented the leftist national ideals important to the postwar era,[97] but used traditional themes, steering away from the outwardly political works of many New York artists at the time.[98] Lynn Garafola compared Copland and Graham's collaboration to that of Stravinsky and Diaghilev; whereas Stravinsky composed purely Russian scores for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, Copland composed American music for Graham's company, helping define American dance.[99]

Themes[edit]
Themes of war, particularly the American Civil War, are present throughout Appalachian Spring.
Themes of war are present throughout the conflict of Appalachian Spring.[100][101] The central conflict begins in the ""Fear in the Night"" episode, where the Revivalist delivers a haunting sermon. Howard Pollack argued that this scene represented the spirit of John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry, something that could cause the Husbandman to be drafted in the Civil War. Furthermore, the subsequent ""Day of Wrath"" episode can be seen as the Husbandman leaving for war, depicted with waves of goodbye. ""Moment of Crisis"" is an expression of anxiety and concern for the Husbandman, and ""The Lord's Day"" is a prayer for peace and safety. When the Husbandman rejoins the Bride at the end, Pollack suggests this is actually in her imagination, further supported by her final gesture of reaching out to the horizon.[100] Mark Franko says that the Civil War themes are possibly a reference to the civil rights movement and ongoing racial inequality in the United States.[28]
The opening of the music uses delicately placed dissonances to create a dreamy landscape. In the scripts Copland worked from, this scene was to feature the Pioneer Woman sitting ""terrifyingly still"" and looking over her land. Elizabeth Crist speculates that the entire ballet is the Pioneer Woman's memory; Crist suggests that the dissonances in the music depict the Pioneer Woman reflecting on the hardships she faced, and that the following episodes are entirely her own experiences.[102] Crist continues that when the opening themes are recalled at the end of the ballet, the Bride disconnects from the Pioneer Woman's memory, becoming her own individual memory; the Bride sits where the Pioneer Woman sat at the beginning, the context having shifted to a new time. Crist describes this as an embodiment of the link between wars among generations: as the youth during World War II saw similar circumstances to the generation of the Civil War, the Bride represents the common experiences of people living on the homefront during the 19th and 20th centuries.[93] Graham's explanation for this was the fluidity of time, where younger generations feel the ramifications of things the older generations experienced.[103]
Shaker themes are also heavily present in Appalachian Spring.[104][105] This idea is found in the original ""House of Victory"" script, where the Pioneer Woman is said to sit in a ""Shaker rocking chair"".[104][106] Copland's interest in Shakers was not new, as they became a common subject of American art during the Great Depression.[104][105] After Copland included the Shaker tune ""Simple Gifts"" into the ""Interlude"", Graham added ""The Lord's Prayer"" as a possible ""Shaker meeting"".[i][108] Copland had decided to use ""Simple Gifts"" early on; by extracting a basic melodic motif from the tune, he created variations on it throughout the composition, first referring to it in the opening measures.[109][110] The lyrics of ""Simple Gifts"" are connected to the ballet's themes of peace and remembrance during wartime: ""'Tis the gift to be simple, 'tis the gift to be free"".[111]

Music and plot[edit]
Prologue[edit]
Audio playback is not supported in your browser. You can download the audio file.The ballet opens with a soft, quiet A major triad in the clarinet.[117][118] The cello sustains the A tonic while the flute, violin, and viola stack build the A major triad again, this time with the dominant chord (E major) stacked in top. This creates a luminous scenescape, but the dissonances foreshadow danger.[119][120] Copland conjures images of a pastoral scene by ending the chords with a deep tonic in the piano and following it with a shepherd flute-like reiteration of the triad.[121] This opening polychord, consisting of the tonic A major and dominant E major, is found throughout the score as a foundation for many of the melodies and tonalities.[122] The Revivalist enters first, in darkness, followed by the Pioneer Woman, who takes a seat in her rocking chair. Then, the Husbandman and Bride enter; as the Husbandman pauses to observe the home, daylight illuminates the stage.[123][124] The four Followers join the Revivalist, who has observed the land with the Pioneer Woman.[54] The two-minute opening has set up the themes present throughout the ballet, and Copland employed the upwards building of chords to depict a ""nonmilitant fanfare"", as Graham described in the early scripts.[54][125]
Eden Valley[edit]
Audio playback is not supported in your browser. You can download the audio file.

An allegro melody bursts forth as the Daughter bounds from inside the home.[126] The melodies of ""Eden Valley"", meant to express the Bride's joy, use elements of an ""old-fashioned swing"" described in the early scripts.[125] The new melody is followed by a bouncy restatement of the polychord from the ""Prologue"". A chorale-like second theme is introduced alongside the first. This chorale features odd rhythms between the different voices; while the upper line emphasizes the second beat, the bass line accents the first and third beats.[127] The music calms down to a moderato; as the Husbandman enters, jagged rhythms show his awkward movement, but it is twice interrupted by the gentle chorale.[128][125]
As the two back out of the home, the couple dances a duet, this time accompanied by a new, more forceful theme in the strings. A descending melodic line is contrasted with the chorale theme; this connection of themes is seen throughout the episode and was used by Graham to easily shift the characters. The two receive the blessings of the Pioneer Woman and the Revivalist. This section is reminiscent of the Cowgirl's music from Rodeo, or the soft parts of Lincoln Portrait for the love theme; near the end, the clarinet brings back the chorale, and the flute answers, a call and response between the Bride and the Husbandman.[129][102][125] Throughout the episode, the Followers participate in various group solos; the group often features a ""spiraling"" motion, moving into a kneeling position. ""Eden Valley"" closes with the Followers returning to the bench, each taking a seat one-by-one. Illustrating the choreography's close connection to the music, the moment each Follower sits is cued by a short motif in the woodwinds.[130]

Wedding Day[edit]
Audio playback is not supported in your browser. You can download the audio file.
A playful, childlike melody springs from the clarinet,[131] opening the first part of ""Wedding Day"" and signifying the start of festivities. Graham wanted the first part to have ""a little sense of a County Fair, a little of a revival meeting, a party, a picnic""; Copland achieves this by relating the music to square dancing and fiddling.[132][125] The music becomes heavier and the jagged rhythms return for the Husbandman's Davy Crockett-esque solo; the love theme returns in the calmer music as the Husbandman carries the Bride into the home.[133] The second part of ""Wedding Day"" depicts the ""old fashion charivari"" mentioned in the scripts. The joyous and bouncy music uses scales and rhythmic jolts to conjure the image of party and celebration.[111] The Bride dances a rhythmically complex solo, similar to the Husbandman's dance in the first part. Instrument sections are clearly divided by quick jumps through changing metres. The uneven rhythms are replaced by consistent eighth notes, starting a light presto; here, Stravinsky's influence on Copland is evident in the Petrushka-like ascending and descending scales.[134] As the music calms down with a restatement of the choral, the Revivalist dances with his Followers before the full cast proceeds onstage. A reprise of the calm opening (marked as at first) follows the characters as they exit for a walk; the light focuses on the Pioneer Woman's face, then fades into darkness as ""Simple Gifts"" begins.[135][111]

Audio playback is not supported in your browser. You can download the audio file.Copland used the Shaker song ""Simple Gifts"" throughout much of Appalachian Spring, first playing it in its entirety at the start of the ""Interlude"".[110][111][136] Throughout the ""Interlude"", four variations on ""Simple Gifts"" are introduced, some fitting the atmosphere of the action on stage (like one variation reminiscent of the clip-clop of a horse's hooves). Most of the variations leave the melody essentially the same, changing other elements of the music, such as the harmony and instrumentation. This technique was meant to depict the lives of various townspeople doing their daily rounds, while the Husbandman and the Bride are dancing joyfully.[111][137] The two are strongly connected throughout the duet, signified by eye contact, ease of physical touch, and openness of the body.[138] Partway through, the Revivalist and his Followers join in. The Revivalist solos in close alignment with the bassoon, accompanied by the Followers.[139] During the half-speed fourth variation played as a canon in the woodwinds, the Revivalist dominantly watches the couple's high-spirited duet, and follows them as they walk into the home.[140][102][138]
Fear in the Night, Day of Wrath, Moment of Crisis[edit]
Audio playback is not supported in your browser. You can download the audio file.
The music of ""Fear of the Night"" nervously jolts and twitches, similar to the ""Gun Battle"" in Billy the Kid.[141][142] Fragmented ""stingers"", as Fauser called them, make the fast section the most ""filmic"" part of Copland's score.[140] The Revivalist takes off his hat and approaches the bowing Husbandman and Bride.[102] The Revivalist's four Followers surround him as he warns the couple of their eventual separation due to the war.[137] His agonized, frenzied dance was informed by the ""dark"" experiences of Peter Sparling, a dancer in the company who would dance the role in later productions; his emotional interpretation influenced future dancers of the role.[143] The Revivalist's solo uses violent shaking to relate the dance to traditional Shaker festivities; the shaking travels throughout the body, like a spirit trying to escape from the body.[144] The demonstration scares the Bride and sends her into turmoil, but she quickly rejoins the Husbandman and accepts the risks of her love.[137]
In ""Day of Wrath"", Copland was ""riffing rather aimeously of the arpeggiated polychord of the opening ... strengthened by an elusive displacement of the beat"", as Fauser described.[145] The Pioneer Woman enters with deep anger, and after prayer, she enters the home. The Husbandman leaves the home and performs a leaping solo, where the music uses a distorted version of the A major ""Wedding Day"" music stacked atop B minor harmonies to evoke anguish as he waves goodbye and exits.[145][146][147]
The Bride opens ""Moment of Crisis"" by frantically running across the stage, and the other women join in an anxious frenzy. The music becomes rushed and agitated into perpetual motion; consistent sixteenth-note patterns jump around the orchestra, with no sense of musical direction.[148][149] The tonality is unstable and different from the common tonal language used throughout the rest of the score.[145] The music begins to calm and the chorale returns as the Husbandman briefly comes back to dance with the Bride. Another variation of ""Simple Gifts"" underlines the Husbandman's slow drift away, and a grand, final restatement of the Shaker tune signals the end of the fear as the Pioneer Woman dances with the Followers.[150][148][149]

The Lord's Day[edit]

A gentle hymn-like melody, marked ""like a prayer"", is heard in the strings as the community gathers for prayer.[147][151][152] The chorale is stated a final time, followed by the return of the opening theme.[153] Graham wrote that this episode ""could have the feeling of a Shaker meeting where the movement is strange and ordered and possessed or it could have the feeling of a negro church with the lyric ecstasy of the spiritual about it"".[41] The Bride dances her final solo and finishes by putting her hand to her lips and then reaching out to the sky. The Husbandman returns and holds her briefly, but the Revivalist comes and touches his shoulder.[151] As the music from the ""Prologue"" returns, the Bride sits in the rocking chair that the Pioneer Woman sat in and she looks over the empty stage. The Husbandman rests his hand on her should"

AschenbrödelChoreographerEmil GraebMusicJohann Strauss IIJosef BayerPremiere2 May 1901BerlinOriginal ballet companyBerlin Royal OperaTypeclassical ballet
Aschenbrödel (Cinderella) is a ballet written by Johann Strauss II. He had written all the principal parts of the ballet, and was intending to fill in the orchestration as time permitted. However, Strauss died in 1899, and it was finished by composer Josef Bayer in 1900.

History[edit]
The idea for Strauss to write a ballet came from Rudolf Lothar, editor of the influential magazine Die Waage (The Weighing Scales). This occurred after the music and dance critic Eduard Hanslick, having been encouraged by Strauss' impressive act 3 ballet score in his only opera, Ritter Pázmán, suggested that Strauss should write a full-score ballet. On 5 March 1898, a contest was organised in order to decide a proper scenario for Strauss' new ballet. The panel of judges consists of Hanslick; Gustav Mahler, the controversial conductor and composer who at the time also directed the Vienna Court Opera (including its ballet company); patron Nikolaus Dumba; Strauss himself, and Rudolf Lothar.
Finally, it was decided (after receiving over 700 entries) that the winner was a certain A. Kollmann from Salzburg. The prize money was even effected through a lawyer representative and there were even rumors circulated that Kollmann was a pseudonym and that he may even be a member of the royalty in Emperor Franz Josef's court.
Strauss was not particularly impressed with the scenario set in a modern department store, although he set to work almost immediately. He worked at his pace and refused to be rushed, and by the winter of 1898, he had completed act 1 and was able to perform small parts of the orchestral version on the piano. By the time Strauss died in Vienna on 3 June 1899, the work lay unfinished, although sketches of the entire work were already done.
Josef Bayer completed the work in 1900 and presented the score to Gustav Mahler for future production at the Vienna Court Opera. Mahler refused to appraise the score, doubting the originality of the work, as Bayer himself was also a ballet composer, and when shown the original score in Strauss' writing, he claimed that he could not care for the music. Many persistent rumors suggested that he was not interested in ballet at all and only concentrated on full-scale opera works. This has been disputed by the fact that Mahler himself was eager to obtain the rights to stage Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty ballet and that due to the lack of budget, he was not able to stage Aschenbrödel as envisioned in the scenario.
In 1901, Berlin's Royal Opera took interest in the score, with its directors captivated by the music, although they disapproved of the scenario. Their choreographer, Emil Graeb, suggested a change to the scenario and the task fell to Austrian writer Henrich Regel. The work's premiere on 2 May 1901 was a success, although reservations were made by Strauss' biographer, Ignaz Schnitzer, who commented that Bayer's orchestration fell short of Vienna's light-heartedness and the now-revised scenario was too ""puritanical"".
Mahler left the Vienna Court Opera at the end of the 1907 season. The new director, Felix Weingartner, who was impressed with the score, eagerly sought it out and conducted the orchestra himself at the premiere in Vienna on 4 October 1908. The ballet was regularly performed for seven years, achieving forty-six performances until the outbreak of World War I. Ironically, Mahler proved to be more accurate in his judgment as to the cost of the production, as the Viennese performances were expensive, and it was neglected until 1975 when the ballet was resurrected.

Summary of plot[edit]
The action takes place in a department store, The Four Seasons. The leading characters are Gustav, owner of the store, and Franz, his younger brother and rival for the love of Grete (Cinderella), who works in the women's fashions department. Grete's stepmother, Mme. Leontine, is the department's supervisor. She has, of course, two daughters who lord it over Grete and do not seem to work though they are often in the store. Another key character, Piccolo, Gustav's valet, is a travesty role. As mentioned, the ballerina (the part is referred to as ""Floral"") appears only in the ballroom (act 2) for the floral divertissement.
Typically, the printed program for Cinderella lists all the dances. From this inventory one gets an inkling how Viennese ballets at the time differed from those of Saint Petersburg, which we know at least a little. There are four dances in act 1. The first, called ""Franz's Self-portrait"", introduces the ballet's junior male lead (probably demicaractère) to the female cast of characters and to the audience. In this solo, Franz (Ferdinand Rathner) proclaims who he is and what he does. One of the things he masters is driving an automobile—dancemiming this topic seems very Léonide Massine. The stepsisters (danced by real sisters, Lydia and Olga Berger) have a Promenade Adventure and Piccolo (Luise Wopalenski) does a ""Love Letter Delivery"" to Grete (Marie Kohler) who, with her trained birds, dances the ""Waltz of the Doves"".
Apparently there are no ensemble dances in act 1, though there are several in act 2, at the party thrown by Gustav. First comes the ""Marveilleusen Quadrille"" for Franz and the female corps. A pas de trois, ""Masked Game"", is for the stepsisters and Gustav (Karl Godlewski, one of Joseph Haßreiter [de]'s deputy choreographers). Grete dances a solo named the ""Blue Domino"" after the costume she wears (probably as covering as she arrives at the party). The ""Confections Waltz"" (which may have something to do with the refreshments being served) features nine female soloists and the female corps; this is followed by a ""Salon Quadrille"" for four couples, a mazurka for the stepsisters, and Grete's big solo, the ""Cinderella Waltz"". The ballerina (Cäcilie Cerri, Vienna's last Italian prima, was ""Flora"") enters in a ""Welcome with Flowers"", which leads into the biggest dance number, the ""Flowertorch Polonaise"" with ""Flora,"" Grete, thirteen female soloists, Gustav, four male soloists, the adult female corps and the group of female students.
An ""Amoretten Polka"" is the first dance in act 3, followed by the ""Bridal-Treasure Waltz"" for Grete, a female soloist, Piccolo, Gustav, and the female students. The next dance, ""Old Vienna Porcelain"", for Piccolo plus four solo women and four solo men, may represent a wedding present, and the final ""Jewels Waltz"" for Piccolo, nine female soloists and the female corps, is perhaps, the setting for the bridegroom's gift to his bride.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Les Aventures de Pélée (The Adventures of Peleus; Russian: Приключения Пелея) is a ballet in three acts and five scenes with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Ludwig Minkus, with additional music adapted from works by Léo Delibes.[1] The libretto by Marius Petipa is derived from the Greek Myth concerning the Goddess Thetis and the circumstances surrounding her marriage, arranged by Jupiter (or Zeus), to the mortal Peleus.
It was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on January 30 [O.S. January 18] 1876 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kammeny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, with Eugeniia Sokolova (as the Goddess Thetis), Pavel Gerdt (as Peleus), Lyubov Savitskaya (as Cupid), Mariia Gorshenkova (as Venus), Christian Johansson (as Jupiter), Lev Ivanov (as Adonis), and Platon Karsavin (as Triton).

Revivals[edit]
The ballet was revived by Marius Petipa as Les Noces de Thétis et Pélée in one act/3 scenes for the Imperial Ballet, with Riccardo Drigo making additions and revising the Minkus/Delibes score, and presented for the Imperial court outdoor at Olga Island in the parc of Peterhof on 9 August [O.S. 28 July] 1897, for a gala performance in honour of a state visit from Kaiser Wilhelm II. Principal Dancers: Mathilde Kschessinskaya (as the Goddess Thetis), Pavel Gerdt (as Peleus), Olga Preobrajenskaya (as Cupid), Olga Leonova (as Venus), Lyubov Roslavleva (as Flora), Alexei Bulgakov (as Jupiter), and Sergei Legat (as Adonis).
There was only one full resumption of this ballet by choreographer Alexey Bogdanov.

32,Babek,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babek_(ballet%29,"Babek , Agshin Alizadeh , 1986","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Babek (Azerbaijani: Babək) is a heroic Spartacus-like ballet in two acts, based on the story of the people’s liberation struggle against Abbasid Caliphate under the leadership of Babak Khorramdin. Akshin Alizadeh composed the music and the prominent Azeri choreographers of the Soviet era Rafiga Akhundova and Maksud Mamedov choreographed the ballet for Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater (National Ballet of Azerbaijan) in 1986.[1]


Story[edit]
The ballet creation narrates the story of the brave Iranian national hero, Babak Khorramdin, who in the 9th century led the rebellion against foreign occupying forces and local feudal lords in Iran. Babak succeeded Javidan, a rebel who had led the resistance during many years. On his deathbed, Javidan declares Babak as his successor and the one who would lead the resistance against the foreign occupation. For more than twenty-two years, Babak bravely fought the Arab invaders from his remote castle in the mountains of northwestern Iran and inflicted heavy casualties on the army of the Abbasid Caliphate. Finally he was betrayed by Afshin and captured by the army of the Caliph. Babak was brutally executed but his legend lives until today.[1]

World premiere[edit]
Created for the National Ballet of Azerbaijan, the ballet was staged in Baku at V.I. Lenin Palace[2] (now Heydar Aliyev Palace) on 20 May 1986.  The principal role of the ballet was performed by Vitaliy Akhundov,[2] winner of the Grand Soviet Ballet Contest. Four performances were staged at the V.I. Lenin Palace and later the ballet was included in the repertoire of the national ballet at Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater.[3]

Presentation in the West[edit]
A series of performances followed the world premiere in Baku during 1986. After a successful season during the same year, the ballet fell into oblivion and was never re-staged in Azerbaijan. Nima Kiann, the founder and artistic director of Les Ballets Persans discovered the forgotten ballet and invited the choreographers to revive the ballet in order to be included in the world premiere production of the newly established Les Ballets Persans in Sweden. Thus, Babek was introduced for the first time in the West and for a European audience sixteen years after its world premiere in Baku. Staging of Babek in Stockholm was also the first presentation of the art form of Azerbaijanian ballet outside the country after the fall of the Soviet Union.

Legacy[edit]
The expressing and colorful music of Babek is one of Azerbaijan's musical compositions best representing the genre of historical and epic music. The composer, Akshin Alizadeh, has mentioned Babek as the composition he was born and living for to create:
""Babek"" is my whole life. I applied much effort into this ballet. When I was working on this ballet, I felt myself like a gladiator. I wrote this composition during the course of 10 years.[4]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Bacchus and Ariadne (French: Bacchus et Ariane), Op. 43 is a ballet score by the French composer Albert Roussel written in 1930.[1]


Ballet[edit]
Its composition roughly coincides with that of Roussel's Symphony No. 3. It describes the abduction of Ariadne by Dionysus. The Paris Opera premiered the two-act work under the direction of Philippe Gaubert on 22 May 1931, with choreography by Serge Lifar and sets by Giorgio de Chirico.[2]

Orchestral Suites[edit]
Roussel created two orchestral suites from the score, the first premiered by Charles Münch on 2 April 1933, and the second by Pierre Monteux a year later.

Style[edit]
A late work, the piece reflects Roussel's distinctive orchestration style and his preference for late classical rhythms and harmonies.

35,Baldurs draumar,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldurs_draumar,"Baldurs draumar , Geirr Tveitt , 1938","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet by Geirr Tveitt
For the poem in the Poetic Edda, see Baldrs draumar.
Baldur's Dreams (Norwegian: Baldurs draumar) is a ballet by the Norwegian composer Geirr Tveitt. It is loosely based on the poem Baldrs draumar from the Poetic Edda. It has never been staged as an actual ballet. The music was performed by a symphony orchestra in Oslo in 1938. The score was lost during World War II but reconstructed and rediscovered in the early 2000s.


Background[edit]
Geirr Tveitt in the 1930s
Geirr Tveitt wrote Baldurs draumar when he was developing his own vision of a Nordic primitivism.[1] He had come to support the neopagan group around Hans S. Jacobsen, which was ideologically National Socialist but against Adolf Hitler. Baldurs draumar is the work by Tveitt that most fully realizes the pagan ideas of this milieu.[2] It was written for a large orchestra with twelve percussionists, some of which would perform on nine special made ""Stone Age drums"" tuned for the pentatonic scale.[1]

Synopsis[edit]
The ballet is in three acts. It tells the Norse myth of Baldr's death, recited by a narrator and loosely adapted from the poem Baldrs draumar from the Poetic Edda.[3]

Production history[edit]
Baldurs draumar has never been performed as an actual ballet, like Tveitt originally intended.[3] A piano version was performed on 23 October 1935 at the Städtisches Kaufhaus in Leipzig and on 16 November 1935 at the Meistersaal in Berlin. The full ballet-score version premiered on 24 February 1938 at ""Aulaen"" of the University of Oslo. It was performed by the Oslo Philharmonic, enlarged to 100 performers, with Tveitt as conductor, Einar Tveito as narrator, Randi Helseth as soprano, Erling Krogh as tenor and Egil Nordsjø as bass.[4] Selected parts were also performed in Copenhagen and Paris, before Tveitt sent the score to London where it was set to be performed at Covent Garden, although this did not come to be.[5]

Disappearance and rediscovery[edit]
The score was believed to be lost in the bombings of London during World War II, and after the war Tveitt reconstructed parts of the work in a shortened orchestral version titled Solgud-symfonien [Sun God Symphony]. In 1970, Tveitt's home in Norheimsund burned down, and many of his scores were lost. In the late 1990s, the Russian composer Aleksey Rybnov began to reconstruct the score for Baldurs draumar, based on a recording of NRK's radio broadcast of the 1938 performance; Rybnov's work took three years to finish. In 2001, the composer Kaare Dyvik Husby looked through the collected remains from Tveitt's home and discovered the original ballet score. It was damaged by fire but possible to use to make corrections to Rybnov's reconstruction. The reconstruction premiered on 24 May 2002 at the Grieg Hall in Bergen, performed by the Stavanger Symphony Orchestra.[4] BIS Records released a recording on CD in November 2003.[6]

Reception[edit]
In spite of Tveitt's claim that Baldurs draumar is ""a wholly and completely Norse, Norwegian work"", critics have received it as an impressionist and orientalist composition.[3]

Legacy[edit]
For Tveitt's 100th anniversary in 2008, Sondre H. Bjørgum directed the documentary film Baldurs Draumar for the Norwegian public broadcaster NRK. The film tells Tveitt's life story with Baldurs draumar as the common thread.[7]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


1581 French court spectacle
Engraving of the first scene of the Ballet Comique de la Reine. Click to enlarge.
The Ballet Comique de la Reine (at the time spelled Balet comique de la Royne) was an elaborate court spectacle performed on October 15, 1581, during the reign of Henry III of France, in the large hall of the Hôtel de Bourbon, adjacent to the Louvre Palace in Paris.[1] It is often referred to as the first ballet de cour.[2]


Creation[edit]
The Ballet Comique de la Reine was created under the auspices of Henry III's mother, the dowager queen Catherine de' Medici, as part of the wedding celebrations for the Duke de Joyeuse and Queen Louise of Lorraine's sister, Marguerite de Vaudemont.[3] The ballet was choreographed by Balthasar de Beaujoyeulx and was the first piece to combine poetry, music, design and dance according to the rules of Jean-Antoine de Baïf's Académie de Poésie et de Musique. The ballet was inspired by the enchantress, Circe, from Homer's Odyssey. The pricey production lasted five and half hours and the Queen and King both participated in the performance. The Queen, along with a group of lady court dancers arrived on a fountain that was three tiers high dressed as dryads. The dancers were entering and exiting from both sides of the set, which was unusual for previous court ballets.  The ballet was also made in hopes of bringing resolution to the religious hardship that caused the French people to separate.  Circe was a symbol of civil war, while the restoration of peace at the end of the ballet represented the country's hopes for the future.[4][5]
Nicolas Filleul de La Chesnaye, the King's almoner, wrote the text, sets and costumes were designed by Jacques Patin.[6] The music was provided by Jacques Salmon, maitre de la musique de la chambre de Roi, and a certain ""Sieur de Beaulieu."" This composer was identified as ""Lambert de Beaulieu"" by Fétis' in his Biographie universelle, following a probable error in a letter by Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor, but is today identified with the bass singer Girard de Beaulieu who with his wife, the Italian soprano Violante Doria themselves sung the airs to Circé.[7]

""Amaryllis""[edit]
The final nine measures of the first ballet, labelled ""Le Son de la clochette auquel Circé sortit de son jardin"" (the sound of the bell at which Circe leaves her garden), contain a tune that forms the basis of a nineteenth-century arrangement by Henri Ghys, which the latter mistakenly attributed to the air ""Amaryllis"" composed by Louis XIII.[8] In Japan, this arrangement was given Japanese lyrics and introduced as ""Amaryllis"" on NHK's Minna no Uta series in 1968. The tune has since become well known as a French folk song there, and its melody can be heard today as a chime signaling the hour over the PA systems of some schools and rural municipalities.
Likely as a result of its popularity in Japan, it was selected as the tune that plays when a Zojirushi rice cooker finishes its job.[9]

Title page of the programme booklet for the first performance of the Ballet de la Merlaison
An illustration of the Ballet de la Merlaison from ""The Three Musketeers"" by Maurice Leloir.
The Ballet de la Merlaison is a ballet de cour first performed on 15 March 1635 at the Château de Chantilly, during the reign of – and commonly attributed to – Louis XIII.[1] It is the most popular ballet performed during the reign of Louis XIII, which marked an important development of the ballet de cour.


Music[edit]
The music of this ballet à entrées is considered to be written with the participation of Louis XIII. While some claim he had written only a few airs,[2] most experts consider the entire ballet to be written by Louis XIII.[3] One thing we know for sure is that Louis XIII made up the story, the choreography and danced himself in the ballet.[1][3] The music is very typical for the era of Louis XIII, yet it is very interesting for modern musicologists, since it is crucial for the understanding of development from Late Renaissance to Early and High Baroque music.[4]

Recordings and depictions in fiction[edit]
A full recording of the Ballet de la Merlaison was made in 1967 by Roger Cotte and Jacques Chailley with the Groupe d'instruments anciens de Paris.
Although the ballet is said to be composed in 1635, André Danican Philidor the elder includes in his ""Recueil de plusieurs vieux Airs faites par Philidor l'Aîné"" a concert, allegedly composed in 1627, which features the air ""Les Gascons"" from the ballet.
In Alexandre Dumas' The Three Musketeers , at the famous ball where the queen recovers the diamond studs she had given to Buckingham, the Ballet de la Merlaison is performed.[5] However, there are some historical errors: The Ballet de la Merlaison was first performed in 1635 at the Château de Chantilly, whereas this ball takes place at the Hôtel de Ville de Paris, before 1627 (since the Siege of La Rochelle started that year and is described from chapter 41 [The Siege of La Rochelle ] onwards, 19 chapters after the ball had taken place). Also, the Ballet de cour is described as a simple ball (with the men dancing with the ladies), not as a court spectacle which not only included dance, but acting and singing as well.

Yet it wasn't easy and the curiosity of the king left him worried. The Ballet de la Merlaison he enjoyed so much on other occasions, seemed endless to him...""

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet égyptien, Op. 12 (1875), is Alexandre Luigini's best-known composition and the only one of his works in the standard repertoire. It was dedicated to Jules Pasdeloup. The ballet consists of eight movements, from which two different concert suites have been extracted. The first suite is the better known.
It originally gained prominence when it was included in Act II of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Aida for a performance in Lyon in 1886. The fame of the piece inspired Luigini to write other pieces on exotic themes, such as Ballet russe, Marche d'émir,[1] and symphonic poems Fête arabe, Op. 49 and Carnaval turc, Op. 51.[2]
Ballet égyptien has been arranged for piano solo, 2 pianos 4-hands and 2 pianos 8-hands,[3] as well as for brass band.
It has been recorded numerous times, by conductors such as Anatole Fistoulari, John Lanchbery, Jean Fournet and Richard Bonynge.  It often appears in compilations of light music.[4]
It is perhaps best known as the background music used by the British music hall act Wilson, Keppel and Betty for their sand dance.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


First page of a 1690 manuscript copy of the musical score for the Ballet Royal de la Nuict, part of the Philidor Collection at the Bibliothèque nationale de France[1]
The Ballet Royal de la Nuit (Royal Ballet of the Night), Ballet Royal de la Nuict in its original spelling and often referred to simply as the Ballet de la Nuit, is a ballet de cour with a libretto by Isaac de Benserade and music by Jean de Cambefort, Jean-Baptiste Boësset, Michel Lambert and possibly others, which premiered on February 23, 1653, at the Salle du Petit-Bourbon in Paris.[2] It took 13 hours to perform and included the debut of the fifteen-year-old Louis XIV as Apollo, the Sun King (Le Roi Soleil).[3]


Plot and music outline[edit]
The Ballet de la Nuit concerned the four Watches (veilles) of the night, beginning at 6 o'clock in the evening and ending at 6 o'clock in the morning: the first watch (sunset) lasted from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m.; the second, from 9 p.m. to 12 a.m.; the third, from 12 a.m. to 3 a.m., and the fourth (sunrise), from 3 a.m. to 6 a.m.[3] With airs by Jean de Cambefort, it was an extravagant court spectacle featuring forty-five entrees and three ballets within a ballet, which took about 13 hours to perform. The plot included mythological goddesses such as Venus and Diana, werewolves, demonic creatures and witches who celebrated a black Sabbath in the horrors of the night. Shepherds, gypsies, thieves, lamplighters, beggars and crippled are among the “realistic” characters of the play. King Louis XIV appears with the coming of the day as the sun god Apollo, one of his many personifications as the rising sun, emphasizing the power of the monarchy and its closeness to the divine.[4]

Costumes[edit]
Henri de Gissey (c. 1621–73), Dessinateur ordinaire du Cabinet du Roy, was in charge of dress design for the royal ballets. A collection of 10 scenic and 117 costume designs for the ballet made for Louis Hesselin (1602-1662) and attributed to Gissey are now at Waddesdon Manor. Another folio with 119 costume designs made for Denis-Pierre-Jean Papillon de la Ferté (1727-1794) is now in Paris at the Bibliothèque de l'Institut (MS 1004).

Ballet de la Nuit in facsimile[edit]
The Ballet de la Nuit was the subject of the annual Oxford Dance Symposium in 2004, and there is an extensive study of the work by a group of scholars.[5] The symposium met at Waddesdon Manor, where the folio volume (Rothschild B1/16/6) with the arms of Louis Hesselin on the cover that contains stage and costumes designs is kept. It also met at Oxford on the same day, where papers were given on many aspects of the ballet. Michael Burden and Jennifer Thorp subsequently published a volume Ballet de la Nuit: Rothschild B1/16/6 with the Pendragon Press in New York. The essays in the volume are: Michael Burden ""The Ballet de la Nuit""; David Parrott: ""Art, ceremony and performance: Cardinal Mazarin and cultural patronage at the court of Louis XIV""; Jennifer Thorp: ""Dances and dancers in the Ballet de la Nuit""; and  Catherine Massip: ""The Ballet de la Nuit: a political and musical statement"". The foreword is by Jacob Rothschild, 4th Baron Rothschild.
	 The volume also includes some of the surviving sources for the ballet, including a facsimile of the livret and a reproduction of the scenography from Rothschild B1/16/6. It also includes a modern edition of the surviving music by Lionel Sawkins. This was the first ballet de cour to be published in complete form.

Film[edit]
There is one scene from Ballet Royal de la Nuit in the historical movie Le Roi danse (scene used in this movie is from the end of ballet, called The sun rise, fr. Le Roi représentant le soleil levant).

Ballo della ReginaChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicGiuseppe VerdiPremiereJanuary 12, 1978 (1978-01-12)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignBen BensonRonald BatesCreated forMerrill AshleyRobert WeissGenreNeoclassical ballet
Ballo della Regina is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine. Set to the ballet divertissement from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Don Carlos, the Balanchine ballet is plotless but alludes to the grotto setting of the divertissement. The ballet is danced by a lead couple and an all-female ensemble, with choreography that showcases the speed and precision of the lead ballerina. Ballo della Regina was made for the New York City Ballet, and premiered on January 12, 1978, at the New York State Theater, with Merrill Ashley and Robert Weiss in the two lead roles.


Development[edit]
Ballo della Regina is set to the Act III ballet divertissement from Giuseppe Verdi's opera Don Carlos, which he had reluctantly included at the request of the Paris Opera,[1]: 295  and cut from most subsequent productions of the opera.[2] In the opera, the ballet divertissement was performed in honour of Queen Elizabeth of Spain, who was absent and in her place her lady-in-waiting Princess Eboli, donning a mask, presided over the festivities. The ballet divertissement is set in a grotto and depicts a fisherman discovering the La Peregrina pearl.[3][4]
Balanchine had choreographed for several Verdi operas early in his career, and told his biographer Bernard Taper, ""From Verdi's way of dealing with the chorus, I have learned how to handle the corps de ballet, the ensemble, the soloists, how to make the soloists stand out against the corps, and when to give them a rest.""[5] Balanchine made the piano reduction of the music himself as none existed. Aware that the music would be uninteresting for the orchestra, Balanchine apologised to the orchestra and hinted he would use more challenging music for his next ballet, which would be Kammermusik No. 2.[1]: 296 [6]

For the lead roles, Balanchine chose Merrill Ashley, recently promoted to principal dancer, and Robert Weiss. Balanchine had spoken to Ashley about a virtuoso role, but she was unaware he was planning for a role for her. She then returned from vacation to find out about her promotion and casting in Ballo della Regina.[7] Debra Austin, Bonita Borne, Stephanie Saland and Sheryl Ware originated the soloist roles.[3] Balanchine choreographed the ballet in a week.[1]: 296  Ashley described her experience working on the ballet, Balanchine was in very good spirits, and I think it was inevitable that he would do something fast for me. He wanted to push me and see how far I could go. He didn't say that to me, but to other people. 'I kept giving her harder things to do, and I couldn't believe she could do it.' There were some things I couldn't do which eventually got changed, but when he makes a ballet for you it's comfortable. He knows how to make one step flow into the next. They're difficult, but you're not forcing your body into an unnatural pattern.[7]

The costumes and lighting, designed by Ben Benson and Ronald Bates respectively, along with the sea-blue backcloth used in the ballet, evoke the grotto setting of the ballet divertissement in Don Carlos.[2][3] In his will, Balanchine bequeathed the rights to the ballet to Ashley.[1]: 318 

Choreography[edit]
Ballo della Regina is plotless,[4] and performed by a lead couple, along with an all-female ensemble consisting of four soloists and twelve corps de ballet dancers. It features a prologue, pas de deux, variations for the two lead dancers and four soloists, and a coda.[3]

The ballet was choreographed to highlight Ashley's speed and precision.[8] Balanchine's biographer Bernard Taper described the ballet as ""essentially a display piece, spotlighting the bravura talent of Merrill Ashley.""[5] Another Balanchine biographer, Jennifer Homans, described the role, In Ballo [Balanchine] gave [Ashley] some of the most difficult feats ever devised in the classical repertory, yet it wasn't bravura that emerged. It was a kind of muscular physics. The squareness and tension through her shoulders and face dissolved in her mercurial speed, legs slicing, as her torso and hips peeled open with ever extreme torque and an épaulement that spiraled through her limbs and brought her once-studied anatomy to life.""[9]

New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff noted the choreography was also tailored to Weiss' virtuosity,[3] and Weiss said Balanchine took advantage of his speed and jumps. He added, ""The qualities that work best in that ballet were qualities that he saw in [Ashley and I].""[10]
Kisselgoff also found that in addition to ballet divertissement from Don Carlos, Balanchine took inspiration from ""underwater‐pearl"" ballets that he became familiar with as a child, such as Saint-Léon's The Little Humpbacked Horse and Petipa's La Perle. According to her, the Verdi score's structure and mood ""has given [Balanchine] his cue"", and the two lead roles of Ballo della Regina evoke the fisherman and pearl of the opera divertissement.[3]

Performances[edit]
Ballo della Regina had a preview performance at a gala benefit in November 1977,[1]: 296 [3] before it officially premiered on January 12, 1978, at the New York State Theater.[5] In a performance later that year, Weiss tore his Achilles tendon and Ashley completed the ballet by herself.[9]
Ballo della Regina has also entered the repertory of other ballet companies, including the San Francisco Ballet,[11] Royal Winnipeg Ballet,[12] Cuban National Ballet,[13] Boston Ballet,[14] Miami City Ballet,[15] Pennsylvania Ballet,[16] American Ballet Theatre,[17] Houston Ballet,[8] the Royal Ballet,[18] and Royal Danish Ballet.[19]

Critical reception[edit]
Upon the premiere, New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff wrote that Ballo della Regina ""is not a great ballet. It is merely terrific."" She added that the ballet ""contains some of the most original combinations of steps that Mr. Balanchine has devised in a long time.""[3]

Videography[edit]
In 1979, Ballo della Regina was televised on PBS's Dance in America, featuring Ashley and Weiss.[20]
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the New York City Ballet made an archival video of the ballet featuring Megan Fairchild and Anthony Huxley available online.[21] The Royal Danish Ballet also made a recording of the ballet, featuring Holly Dorger and Jonathan Chmelensky, available to stream.[19]

Il ballo delle ingrateBallet by Claudio MonteverdiDrawing for Il ballo delle ingrate by Peter Hoffer (undated).OccasionDucal wedding in MantuaTextby Ottavio RinucciniLanguageItalianPerformed4 June 1608 (1608-06-04)Published1638
Il ballo delle ingrate (The Ballet of the Female Ingrates) is a semi-dramatic ballet by the Italian composer Claudio Monteverdi set to a libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini. It was first performed in Mantua on Wednesday, 4 June 1608 as part of the wedding celebrations for Francesco Gonzaga (the son of Monteverdi's patron Duke Vincenzo of Mantua) and Margaret of Savoy. Both Vincenzo and Francesco Gonzaga took part in the dancing.[1]  Monteverdi also composed the opera L'Arianna (to another libretto by Rinuccini) and the music for the prologue to Guarini's play L'idropica for the occasion.
Il ballo delle ingrate was published as part of Monteverdi's Eighth Book of Madrigals (Madrigali guerrieri, et amorosi) in 1638. This printed version probably contains revisions Monteverdi made for a revival in Vienna. The virtuosic bass writing for Plutone is closer in style to Monteverdi's late operas than to that of his Orfeo (1607).[2] The musicologist Paolo Fabbri believes that the revisions were made for a performance to celebrate the coronation of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor in 1636. The sudden death of the previous emperor meant Monteverdi had to produce music at short notice, so he reworked Il ballo delle ingrate, removing the references to the Mantuan wedding.[3]

Synopsis[edit]
The stage shows the mouth of the Underworld. Venus and Cupid visit Pluto, King of the Underworld, and complain that the arrows from Cupid's bow are no longer effective on the women of Mantua, who are scorning their lovers. Cupid asks Pluto to bring the spirits of women who rejected love up from the Underworld to show what fate awaits them in the afterlife. Pluto agrees and the spirits of the ""female ingrates"" enter and dance ""two by two...with grave steps"" as Pluto sings a warning to the women in the audience. As said ingrates return to the underworld, one of them sings a lament regretting she must leave the ""pure and serene air.""

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia





Un bar aux Folies Bergère, by Edouard Manet, completed in 1882
Bar aux Folies-Bergère is a one-act ballet created in 1934 with the scenario and choreography by Ninette de Valois. The music consists of piano works of Emmanuel Chabrier selected and arranged by Constant Lambert, and the designs were by William Chappell after Manet.


Background[edit]
The Ballet Rambert in 1934 had a dancer, Elisabeth Schooling, who had a very similar appearance to the barmaid in Manet's Un bar aux Folies Bergère. Ashley Dukes, Marie Rambert's husband suggested there might be a ballet around the picture, also introducing can-can dancers. In fact the role was created by Pearl Argyle, but Schooling danced it subsequently.[1] The original owner of Manet's 1882 painting was Chabrier; it now hangs in the Courtauld Institute of Art in London.
Bar aux Folies-Bergère was first performed on 15 May 1934 by Ballet Rambert at the Ballet Club at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill, London on a programme with Mermaid and Les Masques by Ashton. The cast included Alicia Markova as the can-can dancer La Goulue, Frederick Ashton as the waiter Valentin le Désossé, Pearl Argyle as the Barmaid,[2] with Diana Gould, Mary Skeaping, Tamara Svetlova and Mona Kimberley (Can-can dancers), William Chappell and Walter Gore (Adolphe and Gustave, habitues of the Bar), Oliver Reynolds (an old man) and Suzette Morfield (a servant).[3] Antony Tudor was the production stage manager.[4] According to the IMDB website, there was a television broadcast of the ballet in 1938, the cast including Schooling, Celia Franca, Sally Gilmour, Gore and Frank Staff.[5]
An early review in  The Daily Telegraph praised de Valois's ""intelligent and amusing"" choreography, and noted the ""star"" dancing of Markova, the ""statuesque"" Gould's skills as a ""comedienne"", and found Ashton's performance and the whole production ""deliciously gay"".[6] Cyril Beaumont commended the way in which the choreographer had made ""a succession of appropriate and reasonable incidents which afforded excuse for dancing and mime. He noted Markova's ""piquant and harmless"" La Goulue which she did with ""such artless naughtiness, and with so engaging an air, as to be irresistible"", while Ashton was ""brilliant ... dapper, suave, deft, lively as quicksilver"".[3]
It was the only work choreographed by de Valois for the Rambert company, was included in the repertoire when the company toured France in 1937, and was performed regularly by them until the late 1940s.[1] The last recorded performance on the Ballet Rambert archive is in Brighton in November 1952.[7]

Synopsis[edit]
The ballet springs from the image of Manet's late masterpiece Un bar aux Folies Bergère. The curtain opens on the barmaid looking into space then busying herself wiping off bottles and glasses. Adolphe and Gustave enter and orders drinks. A waiter, Valentin, is in love with the barmaid, whom he persuades to come from behind the counter to dance with him. When the can-can dancers appear (entering through the audience, as at the real Folies Bergère) and dance, she retreats behind the bar again. When La Goulue does her turn, Valentin becomes besotted with her, breaking the heart of the barmaid, who, after everyone has left and the cleaner starts her work, finally resumes the pose of Manet's painting.[1][3]
The music was chosen by Constant Lambert from the ten Pièces pittoresques of 1881 by Chabrier. Some of the movements were slightly altered by Lambert – such as ""Mélancolie"" and ""Tourbillon"", or cut, as in ""Idylle"", ""Scherzo-valse"" and ""Danse villageoise"" (used as the overture).[4]
Valois's 36-page loose-leaf notebook describing the choreography with comments by Rambert is kept in the archives of the Rambert Dance Company.[4][8]

History[edit]
Marius Petipa created the ballet Bluebeard for his own benefit performance given in honor of his 50th anniversary of service to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The ballet was given a lavish production of the most sumptuous costumes and décor, with the Mariinsky Theatre's machinists creating complex and rapid stage metamorphoses. Many critics who attended the ballet's premier complained that Bluebeard sacrificed plot and artistic sensibilities in favor of spectacle, with the libretto merely serving as an excuse for elaborate stage transformations and even more elaborate dances. Nevertheless, Petipa's dances for Bluebeard were universally hailed as masterworks of classical choreography. The critic from the St. Petersburg Gazette commented on the danced numbers in Bluebeard:

...(Petipa) shows an endless variety ltaste, with his work for the corps de ballet being masterfully executed. This year the ballet master celebrates his 50th year of service to our theatre, demonstrating once again that no one in Europe can claim to be his rival.
Although Bluebeard was very successful during its opening run, the ballet did not find a permanent place in the repertory of the Imperial Ballet. The last presentation of the full-length production of Bluebeard was given in 1899 for the benefit performance of Pierina Legnani. In 1901, the first and third acts of the ballet were given as part of a program staged for the farewell benefit of Legnani before retiring to her native Italy.
A revival of Bluebeard was mounted for the Imperial Ballet in 1910 by the premier danseur and pedagogue Nikolai Legat. As with the ballet's original inception in 1896, the first performances of Legat's revival of Bluebeard were successful. Nevertheless, the large cast the ballet required and in particular the complex stage effects were impossible to produce by the outset of World War I in 1914. The full-length Bluebeard was performed for the last time in 1913. Excerpts from the ballet were given sporadically in galas and benefit performances until 1916, when the ballerina Elsa Vill and the danseur Fyodor Lophukov were featured in a performance of Petipa's celebrated Pas de deux éléctrique.
In 2009, the Russian choreographers Yuri Burlaka and Vasily Medvedev utilized several pieces of Pyotr Schenk's score for Bluebeard in their revival of La Esmeralda for the Bolshoi Ballet, with the music accompanying a new Grand pas des fleurs in the second act.
In 2014, Vasily Medvedev staged a new version of the Grand Pas de deux électrique from Bluebeard for the Dance Open Festival Gala at the Alexandrinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. The performance featured Kristina Kretova and Semyon Chudin from the Bolshoi Ballet in the leads and framed by four couples.

Libretto[edit]
Act I
A garden in front of the castle owned by the De Renounalle family
To the left, the castle with machicolated towers and a large window and door leading on to the terrace. In the depths of the garden is an elaborate gate and railing, through which can be seen a beautiful landscape dominated by Bluebeard's cast. It is a morning in early spring
Arthur, a page, who is in love with Ysaure de Renoualle, steals into the castle belonging to her brothers. Having made certain that he has entered unobserved, he signs to his fellow pages, who creep in masked and bearing musical instruments. Under Arthur's direction, they prepare to serenade Ysaure.
During the serenade, Ysaure appears; she listens with pleasure to the music. Arthur entreats her to descend. She agrees and the lovers embrace. Meanwhile, her brothers, Raymond and Ebremard, watch the proceedings from the shelter of a gallery. A dance is formed in which the lovers take part and at this point, the brothers enter and the merriment abruptly ceases. They order Arthur to unmask. The page and his friends remove their masks. Arthur tells the brothers that he is passionately in love with Ysaure and asks for her hand. They point out his poverty and the stupidity of his request. Arthur admits his lack of wealth, but continues to urge his love, which only arouses the brothers' laughter. Raymond and Ebremard go to their sister and inform her that Bluebeard, a wealthy neighbor, is a suitor for her hand; they counsel her to accept him. Ysaure is filled with grief, but accedes to her brothers' wishes and enters the castle to prepare for her suitor's visit.
Trumpets are heard and the Major-domo announces the arrival of an important visitor. Through the garden gates winds a magnificent procession, which includes the sad-faced Arthur and finally, Bluebeard himself. The brothers accord him every honor, while Ysaure descends the steps and offers him a cup of wine. Bluebeard asks Ysaure for her hand. She hesitates, then consents. Arthur cannot disguise his sorrow. Bluebeard offers Ysaure his arm and together they mount the terrace, where members of his retinue are presented to her. The betrothal is celebrated by a succession of dances.
Ysaure is delighted to see Arthur among the dancers and they exchange words of love. Ysaure's brothers, seeing her happy mood, attribute it to her pleasure in the match they have made. Bluebeard gazes passionately at his fiancée so that Arthur's jealousy is aroused, but he is helpless.
When the dances finally end, Ysaure's ladies bring in a wedding gown in which they clothes their mistress, who then takes her place in a litter, which is borne in procession for the wedding ceremony. Arthur, left alone, gives way to tears.
Bluebeard and Ysaure return and the married couple, attended by their retinue, go towards the former's castle. Arthur wishes to offer Ysaure a flower, but her sister stays his hand. As the unhappy page bestows a farewell glance on his beloved, the curtain falls.
Act II
Scene 1 - Ysaure's Chamber
The rear wall is adorned with a large mirror screened by a curtain. To the left is a rich four-poster bed with hangings. To the right, a couch. Ysaure is making her toilette, while her ladies offer her flowers and other articles of adornment. Arthur entertains Ysaure by playing on lute
Anne and Arthur dance a passepied. Then Ysaure orders the curtain to be drawn and she dances in front of the mirror. Footsteps announce the approach of Bluebeard who, entering the room, hurries to his wife. Meanwhile, Anne and Arthur withdraw. While Bluebeard converses with Ysaure, Arthur enters and announces that a knight desires an audience with him. Surprised and annoyed, Bluebeard consents to receive him. The knight enters and, having delivered a warlike message from his lord, flings his gauntlet. Bluebeard picks up the gage and accepts the challenge. The knight departs.
Bluebeard tells his wife that he must set out on a military expedition, but promises soon to return. Ysaure expresses her sorrow, but is secretly delighted at the thought of his departure. He bids her not to languish in his absence, but to amuse herself with games and dances. He also gives her a collection of keys fashioned of various metals, which afford access to his underground treasure-chambers. She may use all these keys save one, which is made of iron, and if she disobeys him in that respect, he warns her of his severe displeasure. Distant horns are heard. Bluebeard's retainers enter with a suit of armor, which they buckle on their lord. Ysaure passes her scarf over his shoulders. He kisses her and departs. Ysaure, left alone, is all eagerness to try the keys, especially the forbidden one. In the distance can be heard the fading tones of a military march.
Ysaure is now visited by the Spirit of Curiosity, who tries to make Ysaure follow her underground. With a golden key the Spirit of Curiosity opens a door on the left and descends the stairs.
Scene 2 - The First Underground Chamber
The walls are lined with glittering vessels of gold and silver; there are gold candelabras with candles and caryatides bearing baskets of flowers on their heads
The Spirit of Curiosity leads Ysaure through the right-hand door into the chamber. Ysaure is amazed at the treasures it contains. Suddenly, the caryatids become alive and the candles burst into flame. The gold and silver vessels become animated and cause a vast clanging as they jostle together. At the conclusion of their dance, Ysaure opens another door with a silver key.
Scene 3 - The Second Underground Chamber
Here the walls are covered with wonderful materials of all shapes and sizes and from every country
All these precious things come to life. There is a Japanese dance with a fan, a Hindu dance, an Eastern variation, a coda and a final ensemble. Then Ysaure opens the left-hand door with a diamond key.
Scene 4 - The Third Underground Chamber
Ysaure, urged on by the Spirit of Curiosity, enters from the right. The room is in semi-darkness, but gradually, it lightens and is seen to contain heaps of precious stones, which come to life and begin to dance. First, there is a waltz by Diamonds, then a dance by Emeralds, Colored Diamonds, Rubies and Sapphires. Next follows a variation and finally comes another waltz where the Jewels disappear and complete darkness ensues.
Ysaure notices another secret door, which is heavily barred. The Spirit of Curiosity urges to insert the iron key to open this door. At the Spirit's suggestion, Ysaure goes half-eagerly, half-fearfully towards the door. With trembling hands, she slips the key in the lock and turns it. Then she takes a candle and, lighting it, moves towards the chamber, which is seen to contain the bodies of Bluebeard's numerous wives, whom he killed as a punishment for their disobedience. Horrified, Ysaure drops the candle and falls senseless on the threshold.
Act III
Scene 1 - The Terrace of Bluebeard's Castle
To the right, a large tower with steps leading to the top of it. The castle entrance has an iron sconce, to the left is a low stone wall. On the right, a fountain with a stone basin
Ysaure, pale and distraught, comes out of the castle. She calls her sister, Anne and tells her of her discovery behind the fateful door. ""Look!"" she cries, holding up the key, ""it fell into some blood and I cannot wash away the stain.""
The sisters hurry to the fountain and vainly strive to clean the key in the running water. At the same moment, distant trumpets announce the return of Bluebeard. The sisters are filled with terror.
Arthur, who has been watching the scene, runs to Ysaure in the hope of saving her. She entreats him to fetch her brothers immediately. He hurries away on his mission and is seen on horseback galloping towards their castle. Ysaure watches him until he is lost to view and fervently prays for help.
Anne mounts the tower so that she can watch for the coming of her brothers. The trumpets sound nearer and presently, Bluebeard enters in triumph, having vanquished his enemy.
Ysaure goes to meet him. Bluebeard kisses his wife and asks her how she had fared during his absence. She, trying to maintain outward calm, expresses joy at his return, but he observes her nervous manner and is filled with suspicion.
He asks for the keys, which Ysaure trembling restores to him. Remarking the absence of the iron key, he demands to know where it is. Shaking with fear, she gives it to him. He examines the key and asks Ysaure how it has come to be blood-stained.
When she professes her ignorance of the case, Bluebeard tells her that she has disobeyed his commands and must suffer the penalty. Ysaure begs for time to say her prayers. Bluebeard consents, but bids her to make haste.
Overwhelmed with grief, she can hardly walk to the tower. She asks her sister if her brothers are in sight. Anne replies that nothing can be seen.
Bluebeard orders Ysaure to descend from the tower. Once more, she asks her sister if she can see any signs of her brothers. Anne replies that she can now see some horsemen.
Bluebeard, raging with impatience, begins to mount the steps leading to the tower. Ysaure, trying to gain time, hurries to the topmost step. Bluebeard follows and drags her down to the terrace. Then, lifting his swords, he prepares to cut off her head.
At this moment, the brothers dash through the castle gates, followed by Arthur. They rescue Ysaure, and Ebremard challenges Bluebeard to single combat. The contest is waged with varying fortunes, until finally, Ebremard mortally wounds his opponent, who topples over the wall into the moat.
Ysaure swoons into her brother's arms.
Anne thanks her brothers for coming in time. They declare that Ysaure would have been killed, but for Arthur. The page again asks for Ysaure's hand, which is granted and the curtain falls on the happiness of the reunited lovers.
Scene 2 - A Magnificent Garden
In the center is a temple in honor of the god Saturn, with a colonnade in three parts: the temples of the past, of the present and of the future. At the sides are staircases leading to these temples, which are decorated with fantastic marble sphinxes
The wedding guests enter in a splendid ensemble. Next come four astrologers with their trains supported by pages. At their command, the god Uranus descends from the skies, followed by the goddess Venus and the god Mars and lastly, Stars of various grades. The Stars form groups and dance. Then there is a variation by Venus, followed by a waltz rendered by the Stars.
The door of the Temple of the Past opens and there emerges a procession of characters typical of an ancient period of France, who render several early dances such as the Gaillarde. The door of the Temple of the Present opens and now come characters representative of the present, who dance contemporary dances.
Finally, the door of the Temple of the Future opens and Ysaure and Arthur present the Grand Pas de deux éléctrique.
The ballet ends with a final ensemble and apotheosis.

Marius Petipa's final revival of La Bayadère, with the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre shown in the scene The Kingdom of the Shades. In the center is Mathilde Kschessinskaya as Nikiya and Pavel Gerdt as Solor. The three soloist shades are seen kneeling to the left: Varvara Rhykhliakova, Anna Pavlova, and Julia Sedova. St. Petersburg, 1900.
La Bayadère (""the temple dancer"") (ru. «Баядерка», Bayaderka) is an 1877 ballet, originally staged in four acts and seven tableaux by the French choreographer Marius Petipa to music by Ludwig Minkus and libretto by Sergei Khudekov [ru]. The ballet was staged for the benefit performance of the Russian Prima ballerina Ekaterina Vazem, who created the principal role of Nikiya. La Bayadère was first presented by the Imperial Ballet at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 4 February [O.S. 23 January] 1877. From the first performance the ballet was hailed by contemporary critics and audiences as one of the choreographer Petipa's masterpieces, particularly the scene of act II The Kingdom of the Shades, which is one of the most celebrated pieces in all of classical ballet.
Nearly all modern versions of La Bayadère are derived from Vladimir Ponomarev [ru] and Vakhtang Chabukiani's redacted version staged for the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet in 1941 that has remained in the company's repertory to the present day. Outside of the Soviet Union, Natalia Makarova staged the first full-length production of La Bayadère in 1980 for American Ballet Theatre, a version that is itself derived from Ponomarev and Chabukiani's production of 1947.


Origins[edit]
La Bayadère was the creation of the dramatist Sergei Khudekov [ru] and of Marius Petipa, the renowned Premier maître de ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The music was composed by Ludwig Minkus, who from 1871 until 1886 held the official post of Ballet Composer to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres.

Plot outline[edit]
Khudekov's libretto for La Bayadère (meaning The Temple Dancer or The Temple Maiden) tells the story of the bayadère Nikiya and the warrior Solor, who have sworn eternal fidelity to each other. The High Brahmin, however, is also in love with Nikiya and learns of her relationship with Solor. Moreover, the Rajah Dugmanta of Golconda has selected Solor to wed his daughter Gamzatti (or Hamsatti, as she is known in the original production), and Nikiya, unaware of this arrangement, agrees to dance at the couple's betrothal celebrations.
In his effort to have Solor killed and have Nikiya for himself, the jealous High Brahmin informs the Rajah that the warrior has already vowed eternal love to Nikiya over a sacred fire. But the High Brahmin's plan backfires when, rather than becoming angry with Solor, the Rajah decides that it is Nikiya who must die. Gamzatti, who has eavesdropped on this exchange, summons Nikiya to the palace in an attempt to bribe the bayadère into giving up her beloved. As their rivalry intensifies, Nikiya picks up a dagger in a fit of rage and attempts to kill Gamzatti, only to be stopped in the nick of time by Gamzatti's ayah. Nikiya flees in horror at what she has almost done. As did her father, Gamzatti vows that the bayadère must die.
At the betrothal celebrations[1] Nikiya performs a somber dance while playing her veena.[2] She is then given a basket of flowers which she believes are from Solor, and begins a frenzied and joyous dance. Little does she know that the basket is from Gamzatti, who has concealed beneath the flowers a venomous snake. The bayadère then holds the basket too close and the serpent bites her on the neck. The High Brahmin offers Nikiya an antidote to the poison, but she chooses death rather than life without her beloved Solor.

Ekaterina Vazem costumed as Nikya for Act I of La Bayadère. St. Petersburg,  1877.
Lev Ivanov costumed as Solor for Act I of La Bayadère. St. Petersburg, 1877.
In the next scene the depressed Solor smokes opium. In his dream-like euphoria he has a vision of Nikiya's shade (or spirit) in a nirvana among the star-lit mountain peaks of the Himalayas called The Kingdom of the Shades. Here, the lovers reconcile among the shades of other bayadères. (In the original 1877 production, this scene took place in an illuminated enchanted palace in the sky.[3][4]) When Solor awakes, preparations are underway for his wedding to Gamzatti.
In the temple where the wedding is to take place the shade of Nikiya haunts Solor as he dances with Gamzatti. When the High Brahmin joins the couple's hands in marriage, the gods take revenge for Nikiya's murder by destroying the temple and all of its occupants. In an apotheosis, the shades of both Nikiya and Solor are reunited in death and eternal love.

Early productions[edit]
La Bayadère was created especially for the benefit performance of Ekaterina Vazem, Prima ballerina of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The role of Solor was created by the forty-three-year-old Lev Ivanov, Premier danseur of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, with the classical dances of the character Solor being performed by the younger Pavel Gerdt. The celebrated ballerina Maria Gorshenkova created the role of Gamzatti (or Hamsatti, as the character was known in the original production), while the role of the High Brahmin was created by Nikolai Golts. Dugmanta, the Rajah of Golconda was created by Christian Johansson, former Premier danseur of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres and an influential teacher.  The lavish décor was designed by Mikhail Bocharov for Act I-scene 1; Matvei Shishkov for Act I-scene 2 and Act II; Ivan Andreyev for Act III-scene 1 and Act IV-scene 1;  Heinrich Wagner for Act III-scene 2 The Kingdom of the Shades; and Piotr Lambin for the Act IV-scene 2 Apotheosis.
Petipa spent almost six months staging La Bayadère. During rehearsals, Petipa clashed with the Prima ballerina Vazem over the matter of her entrance in the ballet's final Grand pas d'action, while also experiencing many problems with the set designers who constructed the ballet's elaborate stage effects. Petipa was also worried that his new work would play to an empty house, as the Imperial Theatre's Director Baron Karl Kister increased the ticket prices to be higher than that of the Italian Opera, which at that time were expensive. The most celebrated and enduring passage of La Bayadère was Petipa's grand vision scene known as The Kingdom of the Shades. Petipa staged this scene as a Grand pas classique, completely devoid of any dramatic action. His simple and academic choreography was to become one of his most celebrated compositions, with the Sortie des bayadères of the thirty-two member Corps de ballet of shades arguably becoming his most celebrated composition of all.
Petipa's final revival of La Bayadère was first given on December 15 [O.S. December 3] 1900 for the benefit performance of the Imperial Theatre's Premier danseur Pavel Gerdt, who performed the role of Solor. The Prima ballerina Mathilde Kschessinskaya performed the role of Nikiya, and Olga Preobrajenskaya performed as Gamzatti. Among Petipa's changes for this revival was the re-setting of the scene The Kingdom of the Shades from a brightly lit castle in the sky to a dark and rocky landscape on the peaks of the Himalayas. In this scene Petipa increased the number of dancers in the corps de ballet from thirty-two to forty-eight, making the illusion of descending spirits all the more effective.
In 1894, the Imperial Ballet implemented a project to document the company's repertory in the  Stepanov method of choreographic notation. Petipa's 1900 revival of La Bayadère was notated by the Imperial Ballet's régisseur Nikolai Sergeyev as rehearsals were conducted. Nearly the entire ballet was notated in detail.
In March 1903, the scene The Kingdom of the Shades was performed independently during a gala performance at Peterhof Palace in honor of a state visit from Kaiser Wilhelm II. This is the earliest occasion where the scene The Kingdom of the Shades was performed independently.

Vaganova's revival[edit]
On December 13, 1932 the great pedagogue of the Soviet Ballet Agrippina Vaganova presented her version of La Bayadère for the Kirov Ballet (the former Imperial Ballet). Vaganova revised the ballerina's dances for her star pupil Marina Semenova, who danced Nikiya. This included triple pirouettes sur la pointe (on the toes), and fast piqué turns en dehors. Although Vaganova's revival did not find a permanent place in the repertory, her modifications to the Ballerina's dances would become the standard.

The Kirov Ballet's revival of 1941[edit]
In 1940 the Kirov Ballet once again made plans to revive La Bayadère, this time in a staging by the Balletmaster Vladimir Ponomarev [ru] and the Premier danseur Vakhtang Chabukiani. This version would be the definitive staging of La Bayadère from which nearly every subsequent production would be based. The Ponomarev/Chabukiani revival of La Bayadère premiered on February 10, 1941 to a resounding success, with Natalia Dudinskaya as Nikiya and Vakhtang Chabukiani as Solor.
The choreography for the character of Nikiya went through a renaissance in when performed by the virtuoso ballerina Dudinskaya, whose revisions to the choreography remain the standard. Although her interpretation of the tragic Nikiya was looked on as unsuitable for the stellar ballerina, she nevertheless excelled in The Kingdom of the Shades, where Petipa's strict academic patterns prevailed. In the Variation de Nikiya (often referred to as the Scarf Duet) Ponomarev and Chabukiani changed the original staging of Petipa – originally, this variation called for Nikiya to perform her variation alone, with a long veil connected by wire to a fly-space above the stage, with the veil flying upward upon the final moments of the variation. The variation was changed so that Solor would now hold one end of the veil as Nikiya danced, departing the stage half-way through her solo offstage. Dudinskaya studded the choreography with multiple tours en arabesque, and included, for the first time, airy splits in her Grand jetés during the Entrée de Nikiya, as well as adding fast piqué turns in the Grand coda. The choreography for Solor went through a renaissance as well with the great Premier danseur Chabukiani in the role. Although the dances for the role of Solor had become far more prominent since La Bayadère had been performed in Imperial Russia, Chabukiani's revisions to the choreography would become the standard for all proceeding male dancers.
In 1977, the Kirov Ballet's 1941 Ponomarev/Chabukiani production of La Bayadère was filmed and later released onto DVD/video with Gabriella Komleva as Nikiya, Tatiana Terekhova as Gamzatti, and Rejen Abdeyev as Solor.

La Bayadère in the West[edit]
Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn in the scene The Kingdom of the Shades as staged for the Royal Ballet, London, 1963.
Although La Bayadère was considered a classic in Russia, the work was almost completely unknown in the west. The first western production of the scene The Kingdom of the Shades was mounted by Eugenia Feodorova at the Teatro Municipal in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. It premiered on April 12, 1961 with Bertha Rosanova as Nikiya and Aldo Lotufo as Solor. But it was to be the Kirov Ballet's performance of The Kingdom of the Shades at the Palais Garnier in Paris on July 4, 1961 that roused widespread interest in this almost totally unknown ballet from the Imperial/Petipa repertory. Two years later, Rudolf Nureyev staged the scene for the Royal Ballet with Margot Fonteyn as Nikiya. Minkus's music was re-orchestrated by the Royal Opera House's composer/conductor John Lanchbery. The premiere was a resounding success, and is considered to be among the most important moments in the history of ballet.
The dance critic Arlene Croce commented on Petipa's The Kingdom of the Shades in her review of Makarova's staging of the scene in The New Yorker:


... Motor impulse is basic to Petipa's exposition of movement flowing clean from its source. It flows from the simple to the complex, but we are always aware of its source, deep in the dancer's back, and of its vibration as it carries in widening arcs around the auditorium. This is dancing to be felt as well as seen, and Petipa gives it a long time to creep under our skins. Like a patient drillmaster, he opens the piece with a single, two-phrase theme in adagio tempo (arabesque cambré port de bras), repeated over and over until all the dancers have filed onto the stage. Then, at the same tempo, with the dancers facing us in columns, he produces a set of mild variations, expanding the profile of the opening image from two dimensions to three. Positions are developed naturally through the body's leverage – weight, counterweight. Diagonals are firmly expressed ... The choreography is considered to be the first expression of grand scale symphonism in dance, predating by seventeen years Ivanov's masterly designs for the definitive Swan Lake ... The subject of The Kingdom of the Shades is not really death, although everybody in it except the hero is dead. It's Elysian bliss, and its setting is eternity. The long slow repeated-arabesque sequence creates the impression of a grand crescendo that seems to annihilate all time. No reason it could not go on forever ... Ballets passed down the generations like legends, acquire patina of ritualism, but La Bayadère is a true ritual, a poem about dancing and memory and time. Each dance seems to add something new to the previous one, like a language being learned. The ballet grows heavy with this knowledge, which at the beginning had been only a primordial utterance, and in the coda it fairly bursts with articulate splendor.
Nureyev's version of The Kingdom of the Shades was also staged by Eugen Valukin for the National Ballet of Canada, premiering on March 27, 1967. The first full-length production of La Bayadère was staged by the Balletmistress Natalie Conus for the Iranian National Ballet Company in 1972, in a production based almost entirely on the 1941 Ponomarev/Chabukiani production for the Kirov Ballet. For this production Minkus' score was orchestrated from a piano reduction by Robin Barker.
The National Ballet of Panama's debut performance was La Bayadère (1972), the principal dancers were Teresa Mann, Ginela Vazquez, Armando Villamil, Nitzia Cucalon, Raisa Gutierrez and Alejandro Lugo.[5]

In 1974 Natalia Makarova mounted The Kingdom of the Shades for American Ballet Theatre in New York City, being the first staging of any part of La Bayadère in the United States. In 1980 Makarova staged her own version of the full-length work for the company, based largely on the Ponomarev/Chabukiani version she danced during her career with the Kirov Ballet. Makarova's production premiered on May 21, 1980 at the Metropolitan Opera House, and was shown live on PBS during the Live from Lincoln Center broadcast. Makarova danced the role of Nikiya herself, but was replaced by Marianna Tcherkassky due to an injury during the first act. The principal roles included Anthony Dowell as Solor, Cynthia Harvey as Gamzatti, Alexander Minz as the High Brahmin and Victor Barbee as the Rajah. The décor was designed by Pier Luigi Samaritani, with costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge and lighting by Toshiro Ogawa. The premiere was a triumph for American Ballet Theatre, and the company has performed it consistently ever since.
In 1989, Makarova staged her version of La Bayadère for the Royal Ballet in a totally un-changed production, including copies of Samaritani's designs for the décor, and new costumes by Yolanda Sonnabend. In 1990 her production was filmed, and later shown on PBS in 1994 and later released onto DVD/Video. The cast included Altynai Asylmuratova as Nikiya, Darcey Bussell as Gamzatti and Irek Mukhamedov as Solor. Makarova has since staged her production for many companies throughout the world, including the Ballet of La Scala (who have recently filmed their production and released it onto DVD), the Australian Ballet, the Polish National Ballet, the Stanislavsky Ballet in Moscow and the Royal Swedish Ballet.

Rudolf Nureyev's production[edit]
In late 1991, Rudolf Nureyev, artistic director of the Paris Opera Ballet, began making plans for a revival of the full-length La Bayadère, to be derived from the traditional Ponomarev/Chabukiani version he danced during his career with the Kirov Ballet. Nureyev enlisted the assistance of his friend and colleague Ninel Kurgapkina, former Prima Ballerina of the Kirov Ballet, to assist in staging the work. The administration of the Paris Opéra knew that this production of La Bayadère would be Nureyev's last offering to the world, as his health was deteriorating more and more from advanced AIDS disease. Because of this, the cultural administration of the Paris Opéra gave the production an enormous budget, with even more funding coming from various private donations.
Nureyev called upon the Italian opera designer Ezio Frigerio to create the décor, and his wife, opera designer Franca Squarciapino, to create the ballet's costumes. Frigerio took inspiration from the Taj Mahal and the architecture of the Ottoman Empire, as well as drawings of the original décor used for Petipa's 1877 production – Frigerio called his designs ""a dream of the Orient through Eastern-European eyes"". Squarciapino's costume designs were inspired by ancient Persian and Indian paintings, with elaborate head-dresses and hats, colorful shimmering fabrics, and traditional Indian garb, with much of the materials coming from Parisian boutiques that imported directly from India.
Nureyev's production of La Bayadère was presented for the first time at the Palais Garnier (or the Paris Opéra) on October 8, 1992, with Isabelle Guérin as Nikiya, Laurent Hilaire as Solor, and Élisabeth Platel as Gamzatti (and was later filmed in 1994 and released onto DVD/video with the same cast). The theatre was filled with many of the most prominent people of the ballet world, along with throngs of newspaper and television reporters from around the world. The production was a resounding success, with Nureyev being honored with the prestigious Ordre des Arts et des Lettres from the French Minister of Culture. The premiere of Nureyev's production was a special occasion for many in the world of ballet, as only three months later he died.

The danseur Laurent Hilaire later commented on Nureyev's revival: ... the premiere of La Bayadère was more than a ballet for Rudolf and everybody around. This is the idea that I love about La Bayadère — that you have someone approaching death, who is dying, and instead of his death, he gives us this wonderful ballet.
Sergei Vikharev's production[edit]
In 2000 the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet began mounting a new production of Petipa's 1900 revival of La Bayadère.
The choreographer Sergei Vikharev made use of the Stepanov Choreographic Notation from the Sergeyev Collection to assist on mounting the choreography. The production included the long deleted final act, which included the lost Danse des fleurs de lotus (Dance of the Lotus Blossoms) and Petipa's original Grand Pas d'action, which up to that point had been performed during the second act in a revised edition from 1941 as staged by Vladimir Ponomarev and Vakhtang Chabukiani. In spite of the fact that the production was billed as a ""reconstruction"", Vikharev retained nearly all of the Soviet-era choreography.
For the majority of the 20th century Minkus's original score for La Bayadère was thought to have been lost. Unbeknownst to the company, the Mariinsky Theatre's music library had in their possession two volumes of Minkus's complete, hand-written score of 1877, as well as three manuscript rehearsal répétiteurs in arrangement for two violins, which included many notes for ballet masters and performers. Sergei Vikharev commented on the restoration of Minkus's score:


... this is a return to the source. The true, original Minkus (score) was preserved in the theatre's archives. It was difficult to restore the score as the music had been split up. We basically had to check each hand-written page to determine the correct order, because the music had been moved around in the library so many times that if it had been reorganized once more it would have been impossible to find anything. We were fortunate in being able to restore Minkus's full score for this ballet.
The Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet opened the 10th International Stars of the White Nights Festival with their reconstruction of La Bayadère at the Mariinsky Theatre on May 31, 2002, with Daria Pavlenko as Nikiya, Elvira Tarasova as Gamzatti, and Igor Kolb as Solor. The production received a mixed reaction from the St. Petersburg audience, which largely comprised the most prominent persons of the Russian ballet. The celebrated Ballerina of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet Altynai Asylmuratova was seen weeping after the performance, allegedly because of her shock at seeing the ballet presented in this way. When the company included the production on their tours, it caused a sensation around the world, particularly in New York and London. To date the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet only perform the Vikharev production on special occasions.

Other productions[edit]
Among other notable productions is Vladimir Malakhov's staging of La Bayadère for Vienna State Opera in 1999 and for Staatsballett Berlin in 2002.

Ekaterina Vazem on the first production of 'La Bayadère'[edit]
Here is an account by Ekaterina Vazem, Soloist of His Imperial Majesty and Prima Ballerina of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, on the first production of La Bayadère.[6]

My next new part was that of the Bayadère Nikiya in La Bayadère, produced by Petipa for my benefit performance at the beginning of 1877. Of all the ballets which I had the occasion to create, this was my favorite. I liked its beautiful, very theatrical scenario, its interesting, very lively dances in the most varied genres, and finally Minkus' music, which the composer managed especially well as regards melody and its coordination with the character of the scenes and dances. I associate with La Bayadère the recollection of a clash with Petipa at rehearsal ... We came to rehearsals for the last act. In it Solor is celebrating his wedding to the Princess Hamsatti, but their union is disrupted by the shade of the Bayadère Nikiya, murdered at the bride's wish so that she could not prevent them from marrying. Nikiya's intervention is expressed in the context of a Grand Pas d'action with Solor, Hamsatti, and soloists, among whom the Bayadère's shade suddenly appears, though visible only to her beloved Solor.
Petipa began to produce something absurd for my entrance as the shade, consisting of some delicate, busy little steps. Without a second thought I rejected the choreography, which was not with the music, nor did it match the general concept of the dance – for the entrance of Nikya's shade who is appearing amidst a wedding celebration, something more imposing was required than these minimally effective trifles which Petipa had thought up. Petipa was exasperated – in general the last act was not going well for him, and he wanted to finish the production of the ballet that day no matter what. He produced something else for me in haste, still less successful. Again I calmly told him that I would not dance it. At this he lost his head completely in a fit of temper: ""I don' unnerstan what you need to danse?! Yew can't danse one, yew can' danse other! What kin' of talent are yew if yew can' danse noseeg?!"" Without saying a word, I took my things and left rehearsal, which had to be cut short as a result.

Ekaterina Vazem costumed as Nikiya for Act I of La Bayadère. St. Petersburg, 1877.
The next day, as if nothing had happened, I again took up with Petipa the matter of my entrance in the last act. It was clear that his creative imagination had quite run dry. Hurrying with the completion of the production, he announced to me: ""If yew can' danse sometheeg else, then do wha' Madame Gorshenkova does."" Gorshenkova, who danced the princess Hamsatti, was distinguished by her extraordinary lightness, and her entrance consisted of a series of high grand jetés from the back of the stage to the footlights. By proposing that I dance her steps Petipa wanted to ""needle"" me: I was an ""earthly"" Ballerina, a specialist in complex, virtuoso dances, and in general did not possess the ability to ""fly"". But I did not back down. ""Fine"" I answered, ""but for sake of variety I will do the same steps not from the last wing but from the first wing"". This was much more difficult because it was impossible to take advantage of the incline of the stage (which was raked) to increase the effect of the jumps. Petipa responded ""As yew weesh Madame, as yew weesh."" I must add that at preparatory rehearsals I never danced, limiting myself to approximations of my dances (or ""marking"") even without being dressed in ballet slippers. Such was now the case – during this rehearsal I simply walked about the stage among the dancers.
The day came with the first rehearsal with the orchestra in the theatre. Here of course I had to dance. Petipa, as if wishing to relieve himself of any responsibility for my steps, said to the artists over and over again: ""I don' know wha' Madame Vazem will danse, she never danse at reheasals."" Waiting to make my entrance, I stood in the first wing, where a voice within me spurred me on to great deeds — I wanted to teach this conceited Frenchman a lesson and demonstrate to him clearly, right before his eyes what a Talent I truly was. My entrance came, and at the first sounds of Minkus' music I strained every muscle, while my nerves tripled my strength — I literally flew across the stage, vaulting past the heads of the other dancers who were kneeling there in groups, crossing the stage with just three jumps and stopping firmly as if rooted to the ground. The entire company, both on stage and in the audience, broke out into a storm of applause. Petipa, who was on stage, immediately satisfied himself that his treatment of me was unjust. He came up to me and said ""Madame, forgive me, I am a fool.""

That day word circulated about my ""stunt"". Everyone working in the theatre tried to get into the rehearsal of La Bayadère to see my jump. Of the premiere itself, nothing needs to be said. The reception given me from the public was magnificent. Besides the last act, we were all applauded for the scene The Kingdom of the Shades, which Petipa handled very well. Here the grouping and dances were infused with true poetry. The Balletmaster borrowed drawings and groupings from Gustave Doré's illustrations from Dante's The Divine Comedy. I had great success in this scene in the Danse du Voile to Minkus' violin solo played by Leopold Auer. The roster of principals in La Bayadère was in all respects successful: Lev Ivanov as the warrior Solor, Nikolai Golts as the High Brahmin, Christian Johansson as the Rajah Dugmanta of Golconda, Maria Gorshenkova as his daughter Hamsatti, and Pavel Gerdt in the classical dances – all contributed much to the success of La Bayadère, as did the considerable efforts of the artists Wagner, Andreyev, Shishkov, Bocharov, and especially Roller (who designed the décor), with Roller distinguishing himself as the machinist of the masterful destruction of the temple at the end of the ballet.

1995 ballet choreographed by Jiří Kylián

Bella Figura is a contemporary ballet choreographed by Jiří Kylián to music by Lukas Foss, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Alessandro Marcello, Antonio Vivaldi and Giuseppe Torelli. The ballet was made for the Nederlands Dans Theater, and premiered on 12 October 1995, at AT&T Danstheater [nl], The Hague.


Choreography[edit]
Bella Figura is danced by a cast of nine: five women and four men.[1] Kylián described the ballet as ""a journey in time, light and space, addressing the ambiguity of aesthetics, performances and dreams.""[2] According to dance scholar Katja Vaghi, ""The themes dealt with are the inexpressibility of feeling through words, the blurring of reality and fiction, and the fluidity of identities.""[1] Luke Jennings and Deborah Bull wrote, ""The dance itself is a series of flicker-book images with every page impeccable – upper bodies sharply torsioned, arms cleaving space, leg-lines racily hyperextended.""[2]
Like many of Kylián's works, Bella Figura makes references to the Baroque, evident in the choreography, music and lighting design, the latter inspired by Caravaggio's chiaroscuro.[1] In parts of the ballet, both men and women are in long red skirts and topless.[1] Kylián intended to equalise the men and women and the costumes have no sexual meanings.[3] The curtain moves in the ballet to frame and reshape the stage, drape on the dancers and echo the choreography.[4]

Development[edit]
In 1995, Kylián, Nederlands Dans Theater's artistic director, was commissioned by NRC Handelsblad's editor-in-chief to choreograph a ballet for the newspaper's 25th anniversary. Kylián requested and was granted full creative freedom, due to his belief that art is not art without independence.[3] Bella Figura features both contemporary compositions by Lukas Foss, and Baroque music, by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Alessandro Marcello, Antonio Vivaldi and Giuseppe Torelli,[2] with sound design by Dick Heuff and Jorn Mineur.[1] The title of the ballet means both ""beautiful body"" and ""putting on a brave face"" in Italian.[4]
In addition to choreographing Kylián also designed the set and lighting, the latter realised by Tom Bevoort.[4] The costumes are designed by Joke Visser.[4] Apart from the long red skirts the dancers wore when topless, the costumes also include leotards, tights and underwear in red, flesh colour and black mesh.[4] According to dancer Johan Inger, none of the original cast members objected to appearing on stage nude. In some performances of the ballet, the dancers wear skin-coloured coverings, either because the dancers are not comfortable, or at the request of the venue the ballet is performed.[3]

Performances[edit]
Bella Figura premiered on 12 October 1995, at AT&T Danstheater [nl], The Hague.[4]
Other dance troupes that had performed Bella Figura include the Paris Opera Ballet,[5] Boston Ballet,[6][7] the Australian Ballet,[8] Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo,[9] Royal Swedish Ballet,[10] Zürich Ballet and Finnish National Ballet.[11][12]

Ballet written by the American composer Aaron Copland
Billy the KidChoreographerEugene LoringMusicAaron CoplandBased onthe story of Billy the KidPremiere16 October 1938Civic Opera House (Chicago)Original ballet companyBallet Caravan CompanySettingWild West
Billy the Kid is a 1938 ballet written by the American composer Aaron Copland on commission from Lincoln Kirstein. It was choreographed by Eugene Loring for Ballet Caravan. Along with Rodeo and Appalachian Spring, it is one of Copland's most popular and widely performed pieces. It is most famous for its incorporation of several cowboy tunes and American folk songs and, although built around the figure and the exploits of Billy the Kid, is not so much a biography of a notorious but peculiarly appealing desperado as it is a perception of the ""Wild West"", in which a figure such as Billy played a vivid role.[1]
It premiered on 16 October 1938[2] in Chicago by the Ballet Caravan Company, with pianists Arthur Gold and Walter Hendl performing a two-piano version of the score.  The first performance in New York City occurred on 24 May 1939, with an orchestra conducted by Fritz Kitzinger.


Story[edit]
Setting: New Mexico and Arizona, 1870s and 1880s
The story follows the life of the infamous outlaw Billy the Kid. It begins with ""The Open Prairie"" and shows many pioneers trekking westward. The action shifts to a small frontier town, in which a young Billy and his mother are present. His mother is killed by a stray bullet during a gunfight and he stabs her killer, then goes on the run.
The next scene shows episodes in Billy's later life. He is living in the desert, is hunted and captured by a posse (in which the ensuing gun battle features prominent percussive effects) and taken to jail. He manages to escape after stealing a gun from the warden during a game of cards and returns to his hideout, where he thinks he is safe, but sheriff Pat Garrett catches up and shoots him to death. The ballet ends with ""The Open Prairie"" theme and pioneers once again travelling west.

Mexican Dance and Finale
Prairie Night (Card Game at Night, Billy and his Sweetheart)

Music[edit]
Cowboy and folk tunes were heavily used, for instance:[3]

""Great Grandad""
""Git Along, Little Dogies""
""The Old Chisholm Trail""
""Goodbye Old Paint""
It also includes the Mexican Jarabe dance, played in 58 by a solo trumpet, just before ""Goodbye Old Paint"".[3]

Cover[edit]
The eight movements of the ballet make up the first seven tracks of jazz guitarist Bill Frisell's album ""Have a Little Faith"".

Ballet by William Forsythe


Blake Works IChoreographerWilliam ForsytheMusicJames BlakePremiere4 July 2016 (2016-07-04)Palais GarnierOriginal ballet companyParis Opera Ballet
Blake Works I is a ballet choreographed by William Forsythe to seven songs from James Blake's album The Colour in Anything. The ballet was made for the Paris Opera Ballet, Forsythe's first work for the company since 1999, and premiered on 4 July 2016, at Palais Garnier.


Background and production[edit]
Forsythe choreographed his first ballet for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1983, a ballet titled France Dance. Four years later, he made one of his most notable works, In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated, for the company.[1] His last two works for the company before Blake Works I  were made in 1999.[1]
In February 2015, the Paris Opera Ballet announced that Forsythe would become an associate choreographer with the company, and would create a new ballet for the company the following year.[1] It would be both the first large-scale ballet he made for a company other than his own since 1999.[1] Forsythe said he was not planning for a position in a ballet company until Benjamin Millepied, the new director of dance at the Paris Opera contacted him. Forsythe also noted he and Millepied started talking about making a new ballet for the company since Millipied assumed his position.[1]
The ballet uses seven songs from English musician James Blake's album The Colour in Anything, which uses electronic keyboard and syncopated percussion.[2][3] Forsythe had previously used popular music in Love Songs (1979) and Say Bye Bye (1980).[3] Blake Works I is also Forsythe's first ""ballet ballet"" in over fifteen years.[2] According to a New York Times profile of Forsythe, he made use of the Paris Opera Ballet's technical heritage, while the use of arms and feet stems from the French ballet style.[3] The ballet is performed by 21 dancers.[4] Twenty of them are in blue practice clothes that resemble the Paris Opera Ballet School's uniform, and the 21st dancer, a man, is in dark jeans and a T-shirt.[2][4]

Original cast[edit]
The principal dancers and soloists at the premiere include:[4]


François Alu
Léonore Baulac
Marion Gautier de Charnacé
Pablo Legasa
Germain Louvet
Hugo Marchand
Caroline Osmont
Ludmila Pagliero
Roxane Stojanov
Performances[edit]
Blake Works I premiered on 4 July 2016, at Palais Garnier, as part of a Paris Opera Ballet triple bill that also consisted of two other Forsythe works.[4] However, by the time it premiered, both Forsythe and company director Benjamin Millipied were about to leave the Paris Opera Ballet.[2]
The Boston Ballet, which had a five-year partnership with Forsythe, had the North American premiere of Blake Works I in March 2019.[5][6] Other ballet companies that has performed the ballet include Stuttgart Ballet,[7] San Francisco Ballet,[8] English National Ballet,[9] and Dutch National Ballet.[10]

Critical reception[edit]
Laura Cappelle of the Financial Times commented, ""Its modernity doesn't lie in extreme displays, but in the complexity, speed and changing directions of the choreography. Forsythe's vast classical vocabulary puts to shame many ballet choreographers working today: playful references to ballet history abound, alongside rare combinations that speak specifically to the French dancers' articulation and eloquent footwork.""[2] Roslyn Sulcas of New York Times wrote that Blake Works I is ""a celebration of the youth, spirits, talent and collective knowledge of a new generation of Paris Opera dancers, who have never, in my experience of the company, looked better than they did throughout Monday's performance."" She concluded in her review, ""It's a love letter to these dancers and to the art of ballet itself.""[4]

The Blue Dahlia (French: Le Dahlia bleu) is a ballet in two acts, with libretto and choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Cesare Pugni, first presented by the Imperial Ballet on May 12 [O.S. April 30] 1860 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, with Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa (as the Blue Dahlia) and Timofei Stukolkin (as Beausoleil).[1]
Marius Petipa renewed the first act of this ballet in 1875 for a debut of his daughter, Marie Petipa.

Revivals[edit]
The ballet was revived by Pavel Gerdt for the Imperial Ballet and presented at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg on March 5–18, 1905 with Lubov Egorova (as the Blue Dahlia). Petipa disliked Gerdt's 1905 revival to such a degree that he requested his name be removed from the program.

Boléro is a 1928 work for large orchestra by French composer Maurice Ravel. It is one of Ravel's most famous compositions.[2] It was also one of his last completed works before illness diminished his ability to write music.


Composition[edit]
The work's creation was set in motion by a commission from the dancer Ida Rubinstein, who asked Ravel for an orchestral transcription of six pieces from Isaac Albéniz's set of piano pieces, Iberia. While working on the transcription, Ravel was informed that Spanish conductor Enrique Fernández Arbós had already orchestrated the movements, and that copyright law prevented any other arrangement from being made. When Arbós heard of this, he said he would happily waive his rights and allow Ravel to orchestrate the pieces. But Ravel decided to orchestrate one of his own works instead, then changed his mind and decided to compose a completely new piece based on the bolero, a Spanish dance musical form.[3]
While on vacation at St Jean-de-Luz, Ravel went to the piano and played a melody with one finger to his friend Gustave Samazeuilh, saying, ""Don't you think this theme has an insistent quality? I'm going to try and repeat it a number of times without any development, gradually increasing the orchestra as best I can.""[3] Idries Shah wrote that the main theme is adapted from a melody composed for and used in Sufi training.[4]

Premiere and early performances[edit]
The composition was a sensational success when it premiered at the Paris Opéra on 22 November 1928, with choreography by Bronislava Nijinska and designs and scenario by Alexandre Benois. The orchestra of the Opéra was conducted by Walther Straram. Originally, Ernest Ansermet had been engaged to conduct the entire ballet season, but the musicians refused to play under him.[5] A scenario by Rubinstein and Nijinska was printed in the program for the premiere:[5] 
Inside a tavern in Spain, people dance beneath the brass lamp hung from the ceiling. [In response] to the cheers to join in, the female dancer has leapt onto the long table and her steps become more and more animated.

 But Ravel had a different conception of the work: his preferred stage design was of an open-air setting with a factory in the background, reflecting the mechanical nature of the music.[6]
Boléro became Ravel's most famous composition, much to the surprise of the composer, who had predicted that most orchestras would refuse to play it.[2] It is usually played as a purely orchestral work, only rarely staged as a ballet. According to a possibly apocryphal story from the premiere performance, a woman was heard shouting that Ravel was mad. When told about this, Ravel is said to have remarked that she had understood the piece.[7]
The piece was first published by the Parisian firm Durand in 1929. Arrangements were made for piano solo and piano duet (two people playing at one piano), and later, Ravel arranged a version for two pianos, published in 1930.
The first recording was made by Piero Coppola for the Gramophone Company on 13 January 1930.[8] Ravel attended the recording session.[9] The next day, he conducted the Lamoureux Orchestra in his own recording for Polydor.[10] That same year, further recordings were made by Serge Koussevitzky with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and Willem Mengelberg with the Concertgebouw Orchestra.[11]

Toscanini[edit]
Conductor Arturo Toscanini gave the American premiere of Boléro with the New York Philharmonic on 14 November 1929.[12] The performance was a great success, bringing ""shouts and cheers from the audience"" according to a New York Times review, leading one critic to declare that ""it was Toscanini who launched the career of the Boléro"", and another to claim that Toscanini had made Ravel into ""almost an American national hero"".[12]
On 4 May 1930, Toscanini performed the work with the New York Philharmonic at the Paris Opéra as part of that orchestra's European tour. Toscanini's tempo was significantly faster than Ravel preferred, and Ravel signaled his disapproval by refusing to respond to Toscanini's gesture during the audience ovation.[13] An exchange took place between the two men backstage after the concert. According to one account, Ravel said, ""It's too fast"", to which Toscanini responded, ""You don't know anything about your own music. It's the only way to save the work"".[14] According to another report, Ravel said, ""That's not my tempo"". Toscanini replied, ""When I play it at your tempo, it is not effective"", to which Ravel retorted, ""Then do not play it"".[15] Four months later, Ravel attempted to smooth over relations with Toscanini by sending him a note explaining that ""I have always felt that if a composer does not take part in the performance of a work, he must avoid the ovations"" and, ten days later, inviting Toscanini to conduct the premiere of his Piano Concerto for the Left Hand, an invitation that was declined.[16]

Early popularity[edit]
The Toscanini affair became a cause célèbre and further increased the fame of Boléro.[2] Other factors in the work's renown were the large number of early performances, gramophone records, including Ravel's own, transcriptions and radio broadcasts, together with the 1934 motion picture Bolero starring George Raft and Carole Lombard, in which the music plays an important role.[2]

Music[edit]
Boléro is written for a large orchestra consisting of:

woodwinds: piccolo, 2 flutes (one doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes (one doubling on oboe d'amore), cor anglais, 2 clarinets (one doubles on E-flat clarinet), bass clarinet, 2 saxophones (sopranino and soprano doubling tenor), 2 bassoons, contrabassoon
brass: 4 horns, 4 trumpets (3 in C, one in D), 3 trombones (2 tenor and one bass trombone), bass tuba
3 timpani and 4 percussionists: 2 snare drums, bass drum, pair of cymbals, tam-tam
celesta and harp
strings
The instrumentation calls for a sopranino saxophone in F, which never existed (modern sopraninos are in E♭). At the first performance, both the sopranino and soprano saxophone parts were played on the B♭ soprano saxophone, a tradition that continues to this day.[17]

Structure[edit]
Boléro is ""Ravel's most straightforward composition in any medium"".[6] The music is in C major, 34 time, beginning pianissimo and rising in a continuous crescendo to fortissimo possibile (as loud as possible). It is built over an unchanging ostinato rhythm played 169 times[18] on one or more snare drums that remains constant throughout the piece:

On top of this rhythm two melodies are heard, each 18 bars long, and each played twice alternately. The first melody is diatonic, and the second introduces more jazz-influenced elements, with syncopation and flattened notes (technically it is mostly in the Phrygian mode). The first melody descends through one octave, the second through two octaves. The bass line and accompaniment are initially played on pizzicato strings, mainly using rudimentary tonic and dominant notes. Tension is provided by the contrast between the steady percussive rhythm, and the ""expressive vocal melody trying to break free"".[19] Interest is maintained by constant reorchestration of the theme, leading to a variety of timbres, and by a steady crescendo. Both themes are repeated eight times. At the climax, the first theme is repeated a ninth time, then the second theme takes over and breaks briefly into a new tune in E major before finally returning to the tonic key of C major.
The melody is passed among different instruments: (1) flute, (2) clarinet, (3) bassoon, (4) E♭clarinet, (5) oboe d'amore, (6) trumpet and flute (latter is not heard clearly and in higher octave than the first part), (7) tenor saxophone, (8) soprano saxophone, (9) horn, piccolos and celesta; (10) oboe, English horn and clarinet; (11) trombone, (12) some of the wind instruments, (13) first violins and some wind instruments, (14) first and second violins together with some wind instruments, (15) violins and some of the wind instruments, (16) some instruments in the orchestra, and finally (17) most but not all of the instruments in the orchestra (with bass drum, cymbals and tam-tam).
While the melody continues to be played in C throughout, from the middle onward other instruments double it in different keys. The first such doubling involves a horn playing the melody in C, while a celeste doubles it 2 and 3 octaves above and two piccolos play the melody in the keys of G and E, respectively. This functions as a reinforcement of the first, second, third, and fourth overtones of each note of the melody (though the ""G major"" is 2 cents flat, and the ""E major"" is 14 cents sharp). The other significant ""key doubling"" involves sounding the melody a 5th above or a 4th below, in G major. Other than these ""key doublings"", Ravel simply harmonizes the melody with diatonic chords.
The following table shows the instruments playing in each section of the piece (in order):[20]

oboes, cor anglais, clarinets, bass clarinet, bassoons, contrabassoon, tuba, timpani, harp, and double bass; together with the bass drum, cymbals, and tam-tam

The accompaniment becomes gradually thicker and louder until the whole orchestra is playing at the very end. Just before the end (rehearsal number 18 in the score), there is a sudden change of key to E major, but C major is reestablished after just eight bars. Six bars from the end, the bass drum, cymbals, and tam-tam make their first entry, and the trombones play raucous glissandi while the whole orchestra beats out the rhythm that has been played on the snare drum from the very first bar. Finally, the work descends from a dissonant B♭ minor over F minor chord to a C major chord.

Tempo and duration[edit]
The tempo indication in the score is Tempo di Bolero, moderato assai (""tempo of a bolero, very moderate""). In Ravel's copy of the score, the printed metronome mark of 76 per quarter is crossed out and 66 is substituted.[21] Later editions of the score suggest a tempo of 72.[21] Ravel's own recording from January 1930 starts at approximately 66 per quarter, slightly slowing down later on to 60–63.[9] Its total duration is 15 minutes 50 seconds.[21] Coppola's first recording, at which Ravel was present, has a similar duration of 15 minutes 40 seconds.[21] Ravel said in an interview with The Daily Telegraph that the piece lasts 17 minutes.[22]
An average performance lasts about 15 minutes, with the slowest recordings, such as that by Ravel's associate Pedro de Freitas Branco, extending well beyond 18 minutes[21] and the fastest, such as Leopold Stokowski's 1940 recording with the All American Youth Orchestra, approaching 12 minutes.[23] In May 1994, with the Munich Philharmonic on tour in Cologne, conductor Sergiu Celibidache at the age of 82 gave a performance that lasted 17 minutes and 53 seconds, perhaps a record in the modern era.[24]
At Coppola's first recording, Ravel indicated strongly that he preferred a steady tempo, criticizing the conductor for getting faster at the end of the work. According to Coppola's own report:[25]


Maurice Ravel... did not have confidence in me for the Boléro. He was afraid that my Mediterranean temperament would overtake me, and that I would rush the tempo. I assembled the orchestra at the Salle Pleyel, and Ravel took a seat beside me. Everything went well until the final part, where, in spite of myself, I increased the tempo by a fraction. Ravel jumped up, came over and pulled at my jacket: ""not so fast"", he exclaimed, and we had to begin again.


Ravel's preference for a slower tempo is confirmed by his unhappiness with Toscanini's performance, as reported above. Toscanini's 1939 recording with the NBC Symphony Orchestra has a duration of 13 minutes 25 seconds.[12]

Reception[edit]
Ravel was a stringent critic of his own work. During the composition of Boléro, he said to Joaquín Nin that the work had ""no form, properly speaking, no development, no or almost no modulation"".[26] In a 1931 interview with The Daily Telegraph, he spoke about the work as follows:[22]It constitutes an experiment in a very special and limited direction, and should not be suspected of aiming at achieving anything different from, or anything more than, it actually does achieve. Before its first performance, I issued a warning to the effect that what I had written was a piece lasting seventeen minutes and consisting wholly of ""orchestral tissue without music""—of one very long, gradual crescendo. There are no contrasts, and practically no invention except the plan and the manner of execution.
In 1934, in his book Music Ho!, Constant Lambert wrote: ""There is a definite limit to the length of time a composer can go on writing in one dance rhythm (this limit is obviously reached by Ravel towards the end of La valse and towards the beginning of Boléro).""[27]
Literary critic Allan Bloom commented in his 1987 bestseller The Closing of the American Mind, ""Young people know that rock has the beat of sexual intercourse. That is why Ravel's Bolero is the one piece of classical music that is commonly known and liked by them.""[28]
In a 2011 article for The Cambridge Quarterly, Michael Lanford wrote, ""throughout his life, Maurice Ravel was captivated by the act of creation outlined in Edgar Allan Poe's Philosophy of Composition."" Since, in his words, Boléro defies ""traditional methods of musical analysis owing to its melodic, rhythmic, and harmonic repetitiveness,"" he offers an analysis that ""corresponds to Ravel's documented reflections on the creative process and the aesthetic precepts outlined in Poe's Philosophy of Composition.""[29] Lanford also contends that Boléro was quite possibly a deeply personal work for Ravel. As evidence, Lanford cites Ravel's admissions that the rhythms of Boléro were inspired by the machines of his father's factory and melodic materials came from a berceuse Ravel's mother sang to him at nighttime.[30] Lanford also proposes that Boléro is imbued with tragedy, observing that the snare drum ""dehumanizes one of the most sensuously connotative aspects of the bolero"",[31] ""instruments with the capacity for melodic expression mimic the machinery,""[32] and the melody consistently ends with a descending tetrachord.[33]

In popular culture[edit]
The piece gained new attention after it was prominently featured in the 1979 romantic comedy 10, costarring Dudley Moore and Bo Derek. This resulted in massive sales, generated an estimated $1 million in royalties and briefly made Ravel the best-selling classical composer 40 years after his death.[34]
The ice dancing pair Torvill and Dean danced to a six-minute version of the work in winning the gold medal in ice dancing at the 1984 Winter Olympics, receiving perfect 6.0s for artistic merit.[35]
The eight-minute short film Le batteur du Boléro (1992) by Patrice Leconte concentrates on the drummer, played by Jacques Villeret, and the problems of his musical part. The film was screened out of competition at the 1992 Cannes Film Festival.[36][37]
This song played during the torch-lighting ceremony of the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.[38]
It was used by Kamila Valieva in her 2021–22 season's free skate program.[39]
A version was recorded with Frank Zappa conducting an all-brass big-band ensemble.[40]
Koji Kondo, composer at Nintendo, planned to use Boléro as the main theme for the first The Legend of Zelda video game, but reworked it into an original piece shortly before release due to copyright concerns.[41]
Angélique Kidjo performed an adaptation of Bolero in the song ""Lon Lon"" in her 2007 album “Djin Djin”

Public domain[edit]
This piece's copyright expired on 1 May 2016 for many countries, but not worldwide.[42]
The work is public domain in Canada, China, Japan, New Zealand, South Africa, and many others where the copyright term is ""Life + 50 years"". It is also public domain in the European Union (where the term is Life + 70 years). In the U.S., Boléro remains under copyright until 1 January 2025 as it was first published in 1929 with the prescribed copyright notice.[43][better source needed] The last remaining rights owner, Evelyne Pen de Castel, has entered a number of claims that the work was in fact co-created with the designer Alexandre Benois.[44] The effect would be to extend the copyright (when performed as a ballet) until 2039. The claims have been rejected repeatedly by French courts and the French authors society SACEM. The matter will be decided on 24 June 2024 before the court in Nanterre.[45]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


This article is about Balanchine's ballet. For Molière's 1670 comédie-ballet, see Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme.

Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme refers to two different ballets by George Balanchine set to Richard Strauss's Concert Suite (1917),[1] with a libretto after Molière's 17th-century comédie-ballet of the same name.
The first Balanchine Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme ballet was produced in 1932 by the Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo. In 1979, Balanchine (with the assistance of Jerome Robbins) created all-new choreography[2] for Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme, which premiered on 8 April 1979, with the New York City Opera at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, in New York City. This production was notable for being the first ballet Balanchine ever choreographed for Rudolf Nureyev[2] (who at the time was 41 years old).


Performance history[edit]
Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo[edit]
Balanchine's first Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme ballet was performed in 1932 by Wassily de Basil & René Blum's Ballets Russes de Monte-Carlo, featuring David Lichine and Tamara Toumanova, with sets by Alexandre Benois.[2]
In 1944, the ballet was performed by the second iteration of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, with Nicholas Magallanes (taking over for an injured Frederic Franklin), Maria Tallchief, and Nathalie Krassovska.[2]

The 1979 version of Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme included choreographic input from Jerome Robbins, who stepped in during a period of Balanchine's illness,[2] as well as from  Peter Martins, who choreographed one scene near the end of the ballet.[1] By staging the ballet with the New York City Opera instead of Balanchine's customary New York City Ballet, the production was able to use Nureyev, who was not a member of NYCB.[1] Costumes and sets were designed by Rouben Ter-Arutunian.[2]
The premiere took place on 8 April 1979 at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, as part of a double bill with Henry Purcell's short opera Dido and Aeneas.[1]
1979 opening night cast:

Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux — Mr. Jourdain
Rudolf Nureyev — Cléonte
Patricia McBride — Lucille

students of the School of American Ballet
On 22 May 1980, the New York City Ballet produced the ballet at the New York State Theater, featuring Frank Ohman, Suzanne Farrell, Peter Martins, Heather Watts, and Victor Castelli.[3]

La Boutique fantasque, also known as The Magic Toyshop[1] or The Fantastic Toyshop, is a ballet in one act conceived by Léonide Massine, who devised the choreography for a libretto written with the artist André Derain, a pioneer of Fauvism. Derain also designed the décor and costumes for the ballet.[2] Ottorino Respighi wrote the music based on piano pieces by Gioachino Rossini. Its world premiere was at the Alhambra Theatre in London on 5 June 1919, performed by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.[3][4]
Massine described how, in Rome for a ballet season, Respighi brought the score of Rossini's Péchés de vieillesse to Diaghilev. The impresario played them to Massine and Respighi. Toulouse-Lautrec was an influence on the period setting and style of La Boutique fantasque, and Massine envisaged the principal character ""quite Lautrec-like"".[5] Diaghilev arranged for Massine to meet Derain in Paris, and they worked out the scenario with the artist's marionette theatre at his home on the rue Bonaparte. The date of the action was moved from 1832 to the 1860s.[6]
The story of the ballet has similarities to Die Puppenfee (""The Fairy Doll"") of Josef Bayer, an old German ballet that had been performed by Jose Mendez in Moscow in 1897 and by Serge and Nicholas Legat in Saint Petersburg in 1903. Others note the similarities to Hans Christian Andersen's The Steadfast Tin Soldier.[7]
Massine's scenario centers on the love story between two can-can dancer dolls in a toyshop,[8] incorporating elements of comedy, national folk dance and mime, as well as classical choreography.


Story[edit]
The ballet is set in France in 1860. A world-famous toymaker has created exquisite dancing dolls in his magic toyshop. The automata perform various dance routines for the prospective customers. At first the toys entertain two English ladies and an American family. Some dolls perform a tarantella for the guests, followed by other dolls dressed as playing cards who dance a mazurka. Then two dolls come in and perform another routine involving a snob and a melon vendor. New customers arrive, a Russian family, and everyone welcomes them. Five Cossack dolls enter and perform a traditional dance, followed by an animal act featuring two dancing poodles.[8]
Then the shop-keeper introduces his most sophisticated dancing dolls, a pair of can-can dancers, a flashly-dressed man and girl, come in and perform their routine. Their dance is so enchanting that the American family decides to buy the male doll while the Russian family buys the female dancing doll. The deals are made and paid for, the dolls are placed in separate boxes and collection is arranged for the next day.[8]
Darkness descends, but during the night, the dolls magically come to life and start dancing. They are upset that the two can-can dancers who are lovers are going to be separated, and a plot is hatched to hide them before the customers return in the morning.
When the shop opens the next day and the customers come in to pick up their dolls, they discover that the can-can dancers are no longer there. The customers, not knowing about the secret life of the dolls, blame the shop owner and attack him and his assistant. In the ensuing fracas, the dolls come to the shopkeeper's rescue with the Cossack dolls attacking the customers with their bayonets. Driven out of the shop, the customers watch incredulously through the window as the happy dolls and the shopkeeper dance merrily inside with the re-united can-can dancers.[8][9]

Original cast[edit]
Among the large cast in the original production were:

Enrico Cecchetti as Shopkeeper
Alexander Gavrilov as Shop Assistant, described by Buckle as ""characters of Dickensian eccentricity""
Serge Grigoriev as Russian Merchant
Lydia Sokolova and Leon Woizikowski as Tarantella Dancers
Lubov Tchernicheva as Queen of Clubs
Vera Nemchinova as Queen of Hearts
Stanislas Idzikowski as The Snob – ""a caricature of an English dandy""
Nicolas Zverev as Cossack Chief
Vera Clark and Nicholas Kremnev as Dancing Poodles
Lydia Lopokova and Léonide Massine as Can-can Dancers – who imitated the ""contortions of Lautrec's Valentin le désossé""[10][11][12]
Performance history[edit]
Set design for the boutique by Léon Bakst (1918/24)
According to ballet historian Cyril Beaumont, the first night was packed with well-known artists and performers eagerly awaiting the new ballet.[13] Picasso made a sketch of Massine and Lopukhova in their final pose.[14] Paris saw La Boutique fantasque for the first time on Christmas Eve 1919. Despite Massine's dismissal from the Ballets Russes in early January 1921, the ballet was revived in the following May at the Prince's Theatre in London and at the Gaîté-Lyrique in Paris in 1925 and on tour in Europe in the following years, and was on the bill of the final performance of Diaghilev's company in Vichy on 4 August 1929; the impresario died two weeks later in Venice.[15]
The enormous success of Colonel de Basil's Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in Europe and America prompted J.C. Williamson Management to arrange the company's first tour to Australia and New Zealand. Thus, La Boutique fantasque was the first ballet by Léonide Massine to be performed in Australia. It had its Australian premiere at the Theatre Royal, Adelaide, during the opening night of the Ballets Russe de Monte Carlo tour on 13 October 1936.[16] Valentina Blinova and Leon Woizikowski were particularly celebrated as the can-can dancers.[17]
When Massine left the company of Colonel de Basil in 1937, La Boutique fantasque was among the works involved in a copyright dispute. Following a legal ruling in 1937, de Basil was no longer allowed to perform pre-1932 works by Massine. The performance rights then reverted to the choreographer.[3]
Massine subsequently mounted the work for the re-formed Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo some time in 1939, where it formed a triptych of high-spirited ballets with his Gaîté Parisienne and Le Beau Danube. The ballerina roles in all three ballets became indelibly associated with the elegant and witty interpretations of Alexandra Danilova.[18]
Massine mounted La Boutique fantasque for Ballet Theatre, later known as American Ballet Theatre, in 1942 and its American premiere took place at the Central High School Auditorium in Omaha, Nebraska, on 4 January 1943. Among the cast were Simon Semenoff (Shopkeeper), Nicolas Orloff (Shop Assistant), Muriel Bentley (English Old Maid), Antony Tudor (American Patron), Jerome Robbins (American Boy), Nora Kaye and Yurek Lazowsky (Tarantella Dancers), John Taras (Melon Hawker), André Eglevsky (Cossack Chief), Karen Conrad and John Kriza (Dancing Poodles), and Irina Baronova and Léonide Massine (Can-can Dancers).[19]
The Royal Ballet in London mounted the work in 1947 as part of the renewal of its repertoire for Covent Garden; Massine was in charge of the production and danced his original role. In 1948, Danilova appeared alongside him.[20] The Royal Ballet touring company revived the piece in Stratford in 1968 and it remained in their repertory for several years after, and Massine returned to coach the company for the 1978 run.[21]

Score[edit]
Buckle notes that as the ballet took shape it became clear that each musical number was ""perfect of its kind"" and that there was ample variety of tunes and related dances.[22] The Rossini piano works used include Gherkins, Radishes, Butterflies, Themes in Variation, Almonds, Petit Caprice (Style Offenbach), Tarantelle pur Sang, Castor Oil, Abortive polka, and La Danza.[23]
The music was a major contribution to the success of the ballet, whose score was well-orchestrated, kept Rossini's harmonies, and generally retained his phrasing unaltered while investing his melodies with a new breadth.[24] The instrumentation is piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, bass drum, side drum, xylophone, percussion, celesta, harp and strings.[25]

Brahms–Schoenberg Quartet is a one-act ballet by George Balanchine, to Johannes Brahms's Piano Quartet No. 1, orchestrated by Arnold Schoenberg. The ballet premiered on April 21, 1966 at the New York State Theater, performed by the New York City Ballet.


Background and production[edit]
Arnold Schoenberg's orchestration of Johannes Brahms's Piano Quartet No. 1 premiered in 1937.[1] According to the George Balanchine Trust, Balanchine had said the chamber music were ""too long, with too many repeats, and meant for small rooms"", therefore went with the Schoenberg version.[2] The ballet is plotless and has four movements, titled Allegro, Intermezzo, Andante and Rondo Alla Zingarese.[3] In the original production, Barbara Karinska, Peter Harvey and Ronald Bates designed the costumes, sets and lighting respectively.[1][4] In 1985, two years after Balanchine died, NYCB switched to a new set designed by David Mitchell,[1][3] Mark Stanley later redesigned the lighting.[5]
Brahms–Schoenberg Quartet premiered on April 21, 1966, performed by the New York City Ballet.[5] On the premiere, The New York Times critic Clive Barnes called the ballet ""careful but tedious"".[4] Another reviewer, Anna Kisselgoff, wrote in 1985 that the ballet is not one of Balanchine's best, and in 1994 noted that the ballet is ""too inconsistent"" to be a masterpiece and ""demands a strong performance.""[6]
In 2016, the Paris Opera Ballet performed Brahms–Schoenberg Quartet with new sets and costumes by Karl Lagerfeld.[7] The San Francisco Ballet had also performed the ballet.[8]

Ballet by Jerome Robbins


BrandenburgChoreographerJerome RobbinsMusicJohann Sebastian BachPremiereJanuary 22, 1997 (1997-01-22)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesign
Holly Hynes
Jennifer Tipton
GenreNeoclassical ballet
Brandenburg is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach. Danced by a cast of twenty, the plotless ballet is set to Bach's Brandenburg Concerto No. 3, as well as individual movements from Brandenburg Concertos Nos. 1, 2 and 6. The ballet premiered on January 22, 1997, at the New York State Theater, danced by the New York City Ballet. Brandenburg is Robbins' last work.


Choreography[edit]
Brandenburg is set to excerpts of Brandenburg Concertos, including the entirety of No. 3, and the second movement of No. 2, fourth movement of No. 1 and the third movement of No. 6.[1][2] The ballet is danced by four principal dancers and a corps de ballet of sixteen.  Jean-Pierre Frohlich, Robbins' ballet master, described the ballet as ""a plotless piece in which the steps create the mood.""[3]
In his biography of Robbins, Greg Lawrence described, ""the ballet began with a festive folk dance, and from there the dancing alternated between duets for the principals and group formations for the rest of the communal gathering. The configurations were often quite intricate and marked by lightning-fast transformations.""[3] Dance critics Anna Kisselgoff and Deborah Jowitt both compared the patterns in the ballet to a kaleidoscope.[1][4]
Author Terry Teachout commented, ""A large-scale ensemble piece structured along classical lines, it contains no implied relationships, and the dancers are not individually characterized. But a closer look reveals that it is also merely the latest in Robbins's long series of dances about dancers specifically, a corps of Robbins-style dancers performing a ""neoclassical"" ballet which incorporates all the choreographer's signature moves.""[5] Dance critics noticed the ballet echoes Robbins' earlier works, including Dances at a Gathering, The Goldberg Variations, Glass Pieces, Fanfare, Interplay and Fancy Free.[5][4]

Development[edit]
After Robbins used Bach's music for his 1971 ballet The Goldberg Variations, he did not use the composer's works again until his later life, when three of his last four ballets were set to Bach. The other two ballets were A Suite of Dances and 2 and 3 Part Inventions.[4] Robbins began working on Brandenburg in 1995.[1] On the music, he said, ""I find the richness [of Bach] very, very exciting, thrilling, and disturbing in a way... It doesn't seem like something by an old man... He's taking strange journeys while searching out all the things he wants to find out"".[3] With his poor health, Robbins worked on and off for two years to complete the ballet,[4] during which he had mitral valve replacement surgery,[6] shown symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, and had issues with balancing as a result of a fall.[7] In early 1997, he felt well enough to focus on completing Brandenburg,[3] While working on the ballet, Robbins declared, ""I feel I have one more big ballet in me.""[8]
Robbins began developing the ballet as a pas de deux for two New York City Ballet principal dancers, Lourdes Lopez and Nikolaj Hübbe. Though Robbins usually inform the dancers the synopsis of the ballet from the outset, he did not tell the pair whether the pas de deux was an experiment or part of a bigger piece.[7] He then brought in another pair of principal dancers, Wendy Whelan and Peter Boal, along with the corps de ballet.[a][7]
Robbins described working with the young cast, ""I can't show them what I want them to do so they all move around with stiff-legged movements imitating me and not my intentions... The kids realize I'm not my old self and are trying to be helpful. They are a lovely bunch. I don't know how they remember all the changes I make all the time.""[3] Benjamin Millepied, a member of the corps de ballet, recalled that there were months when Robbins would show the ballet to different people, which Millepied believed stemmed from the practice of workshopping on Broadway theatre.[7] Whelan believed that Robbins knew this could be his last work and ""wanted everything to be perfect and masterful.""[7]
Boal believed that Robbins choreographed 90 minutes of material but only 40 minutes are used in the ballet. According to Boal, towards the end of the creation process, Robbins was struggling to complete the finale. Peter Martins, the leader of the company, told Robbins, ""You did it, you have a ballet! We could give you another year, but it's been two already.""[7] Frohlich felt that Robbins still completed the ballet quickly, and believed it was because Robbins was unable to demonstrate the steps to the dancers then reconsider it. Instead, he had to come up with a series of movements completely before giving them to the dancers.[6]
The costumes are designed by Holly Hynes, with the dancers in peasant attires.[1] Robbins gave many directions to her, such as ""green with a little bit of yellow and not too close to blue"", resulting in her re-dyeing the fabrics many times.[4] Jennifer Tipton designed the lighting.[1] The ballet was funded by New York City Ballet's New Combination Fund, which was founded six years prior to the premiere to support new choreography.[1]
Brandenburg premiered on January 22, 1997, at the New York State Theater. The premiere was on the late New York City Ballet co-founder George Balanchine's birthday, and was part of the first in an annual series on his birthday.[1][3] With Robbins' death in 1998, Brandenburg became his last work.[8]

Critical reception[edit]
Critic Anna Kisselgoff of The New York Times opined, ""Never has Mr. Robbins moved bodies in space with such dazzling speed and density. Choreographically, he has outdone himself here.""[1]

Notes[edit]

Ballet about Frida Kahlo


Broken WingsChoreographerAnnabelle Lopez OchoaMusicPeter SalemPremiere13 April 2016 (2016-04-13)Sadler's Wells TheatreOriginal ballet companyEnglish National BalletCharactersFrida KahloDiego RiveraDesignDieuweke van ReijCreated forTamara RojoIrek Mukhamedov
Broken Wings is a one-act ballet about Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, choreographed by Annabelle Lopez Ochoa, dramaturged by Nancy Meckler and designed by Dieuweke van Reij. The music was composed by Peter Salem, and featured Mexican folk song ""La Llorona"" sung by Chavela Vargas. The ballet premiered on 13 April 2016 at the Sadler's Wells Theatre, danced by the English National Ballet, with Tamara Rojo as Kahlo and Irek Mukhamedov as Kahlo's husband, Diego Rivera. Lopez Ochoa then created a three-act version titled Frida for the Dutch National Ballet, premiered in 2020.


Production[edit]
External videos Broken Wings: Frida and Diego (extract), YouTube video Broken Wings: Male Fridas (extract), YouTube video
Annabelle Lopez Ochoa was commissioned by English National Ballet to create a ballet as a part of She Said, an all-female choreographer triple bill, which was planned by artistic director Tamara Rojo, as she had never danced in piece by a woman. Lopez Ochoa said she was already interested in creating a ballet about Frida Kahlo prior to the invitation, and decided to use this opportunity to do so, but noted she intended the ballet to ""tell the basic facts of Kahlo's life before letting her choreography loose into a more abstract, surreal treatment"". She also brought in dramaturg Nancy Meckler, who had worked with Lopez Ochoa on another project. Rojo, who is also a lead principal dancer, was asked to dance Kahlo, as she is a ""petite, Hispanic dancer"". Irek Mukhamedov, then 56, was cast as Diego Rivera at Rojo's suggestion, as he was ""old enough"" but ""fit enough"".[1] Kahlo's main costume in the ballet is inspired by her 1944 self-portrait, The Broken Column,[2] and the dancer portraying Rivera wears a fat suit.[3]

Revivals[edit]
In 2019, Broken Wings was revived for another all-female choreographer mixed bill, She Persisted, with Katja Khaniukova taking over as Kahlo, and Mukhamedov reprising his role.[4] Later that year, an excerpt of the ballet was performed at a gala in Guadalajara, Mexico, danced by Rojo and Yuri Possokhov. ""La Llorona"" was sung live by Geo Meneses.[5] In 2020, in response to the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, the English National Ballet streamed the performance online. It was filmed during the show's original run, danced by Rojo and Mukhamedov.[6]

Frida[edit]
Dutch National Ballet's artistic director Ted Brandsen, who watched the original run of Broken Wings, said that he believed that Broken Wings ""needed more space to breathe"" but nevertheless was ""impressed"". Following the success of another piece by Lopez Ochoa in Amsterdam, Brandsen invited her to create a full-length version. The ballet premiered on 6 February 2020, with principal dancers Maia Makhateli and James Stout as Kahlo and Rivera respectively.[7][8]
This ballet kept 25 minutes from Broken Wings, revised 13 minutes, and the rest of the piece was filled by new choreography. This version also used original music by Peter Salem, and two other songs, ""Que te vaya bonito"" and ""Noches de Ahuatepec"" were also used in addition to ""La Llorona"". Dramaturg Nancy Meckler and designer Dieuweke van Reij, both of whom had worked on Broken Wings, were also brought back for Frida.[7][8]

The Cage is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to Stravinsky's Concerto in D. The ballet depicts a tribe of female insects that preys on their male counterparts, in which the Novice falls in love with a male intruder, before being overcome by her animal instincts to kill him. The Cage was made for the New York City Ballet, and premiered on June 10, 1951, at the City Center of Music and Drama, with Nora Kaye as the Novice.


Plot[edit]
Among a tribe of female insect that preys on their male counterparts, The Novice, the daughter of The Queen, is born, and her membranous covering is removed. She is confronted by the First Intruder, a male insect, and she reflexively stabs him and cracks his neck until he dies. The tribe celebrates that she has been initiated. The Second Intruder appears, and this time the tribe leave her to kill him. However, the two fall in love and mate. The tribe returns and the couple attempts to hide, but are discovered. The tribe attacks the Second Intruder, and finally, the Novice is overcome by animal instincts and kills him. The Novice is embraced by the Queen, while the rest of the tribe salutes her.

Production[edit]
Two years before Robbins began working on the ballet, he discovered Stravinsky's Concerto in D on the flip side of a recording of Apollon Musagète.[2]: 190  He found it ""terribly driven, coerced, compelled.""[3]: 187  He originally envisioned Tanaquil Le Clercq to star in the ballet to the concerto.[3]: 188  Previously, nearly all of Stravinsky ballets at the New York City Ballet were choreographed by George Balanchine.[2] Inspired by the sexuality Le Clercq showcased in Balanchine's Orpheus, his original plan for the ballet was about the Amazons in Greek mythology, tentatively titled The Amazons, and would be a part of a trilogy alongside Balanchine's Apollo and Orpheus.[3]: 188  Robbins searched for Greek mythology about the Amazons.[3]: 188  The plot of the ballet would be a reversal of the killing of Hippolyta by Hercules, with the woman, rather than the man, to be the killer.[1]
Robbins choreographed the opening of The Amazons, but disliked it.[1] He then suspended his work on the ballet and took time away from the New York City Ballet to focus on his work on the musical The King and I. During this period of time, he discovered a book about spiders and realised that he ""did not have to confine myself to human beings moving in a way that we know is human,"" and started researching on human cult rituals, animal and insect societies, and visited the zoo to observe tigers. He renamed the ballet The Cage, now about female insects that prey on their male counterparts.[3]: 188–189 
While Robbins was away, Le Clercq was so successful in originating the lead role in Balanchine's La Valse that Balanchine did not want her to work on the Robbins ballet.[3]: 188  Robbins returned to the company in spring 1951 on the ballet.[4]: 186  For his new female lead, he chose Nora Kaye, for her ""terrific drive and forcefulness and difference of personality.""[3]: 188  Kaye was not a member of the company when Robbins first conceived the ballet.[1] After she joined the company, she had not been given the opportunity to showcase her talents in drama.[2]: 190  Years later, Robbins wrote of Kaye's performance, ""She didn't ever play human or have human responses. She was much more terrifying & unearthly. She performed the role quietly. With a beetle's eyes & no expression. As one cannot read into [the] eyes or thinking [of] an insect she remained appalling in her surrenders, instincts and actions – an extraordinary creature – not a ballerina doing ketchy movements.""[2]: 190 
Robbins' process on the ballet was uncharacteristically smooth.[3]: 190  In the choreography, he took inspiration from the animals he researched on, as well as Thai and Balinese court dancing, which he studied when he worked on The King and I.[3]: 190  The corps de ballet took some time to understand how they are supposed to be ugly and contorted. Yvonne Mounsey, who originated the role of the Queen, noted that Robbins was ""a bit rough"" with the corps. As soon as they understood it, Robbins described that ""they went ahead like wildfire.""[3]: 190  Mounsey, who trained as a gymnast, did not have trouble with the steps and was able to execute what Robbins requested quickly.[3]: 190–191 
The costumes of the ballet were designed by Ruth Sobotka, at the time a dancer at the company. Though she was already a registered member of United Scenic Artists, The Cage marked the first time she worked as a designer in New York.[5] The dancers are dressed in nude-colored leotards with black curly lines.[2]: 188  The set and lighting was by Jean Rosenthal. The decor features spiderwebs of ropes hanging from the ceiling, which was added by accident, when Rosenthal was lowering an overhead web after a stage rehearsal, and Robbins requested her to add the ropes to the set.[2]: 188 

Performances[edit]
The Cage premiered on June 10, 1951, at the City Center of Music and Drama.[6] Though most audience erupted into cheers after the performance, some of the audience was offended by the ballet, and Robbins' mother walked out of the theatre halfway through the ballet.[3]: 191 
On the New York City Ballet's European tour in 1952, there was an attempt to ban The Cage, which a Dutch dance critic described as ""pornographic"", in The Hague. After Robbins said he would withdraw all his works from the tour, and Kaye threatened to not perform during the tour, the Dutch officials allowed it to be performed.[4]: 189 [1]
In 1961, The Cage entered the repertory of Ballets: USA, Robbins company, during what would become the company's last season.[4]: 195 
In 1972, The Cage was included in the New York City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival, a tribute to the composer a year after his death.[1]
Other ballet companies that have performed the ballet include Birmingham Royal Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, the Australian Ballet and English National Ballet.[6][7]

Critical reception[edit]
Following the premiere, John Martin of the New York Times commented, ""It is an angry, sparse, unsparing piece, decadent in its concern with misogyny and its contempt for procreation. It dodges no issues, but cuts to the heart of the matter with sharp and steely thrusts. Its characters are insects, it is without heart or conscience. But in spite of the potency of its negations, it is a tremendous little work, with the mark of genius upon it.""[8]

Videography[edit]
In 1980, The Cage was among several of Robbins' work that was filmed for NBC's series Live from Studio 8H, with Heather Watts as the Novice, Florence Fitzgerald as the Queen, Robert Maiorano as the First Intruder, and Bart Cook as the Second Intruder.[2]: 450 [9]

Camargo (or La Camargo) is a grand ballet in three acts and nine scenes, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Ludwig Minkus. The libretto by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Marius Petipa is based on an incident in the life of the 18th-century dancer Marie Camargo, in which she and her sister Madeleine were abducted by the Comte de Melun in May 1728 and taken to his mansion.[1]
The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on December 7/19 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1872 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Principal Dancers were Adèle Grantzow (as Marie Camargo), Alexandra Virginia (as Madeleine Camargo), Lev Ivanov (as Vestris, the Maître de Ballet) and Timofei Stukolkin (as the Comte de Melun).

Revivals[edit]
Camargo was revived by Petipa's second ballet master Lev Ivanov for the Imperial Ballet, especially for the farewell benefit performance in honour of the Imperial Ballet's Prima Balerina Assoluta Pierina Legnani, who left for her native Italy shortly thereafter. It was first presented at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre on January 17–30, 1901, in St. Petersburg, Russia, with Legnani (as Marie Camargo), Olga Preobrajenskaya (as Madeleine Camargo), Pavel Gerdt (as Vestris, the Maître de Ballet) and Georgii Kiaksht (as the Comte de Melun).

1967 ballet
Carmen SuiteMaya Plisetskaya as Carmen, 1974ChoreographerAlberto AlonsoMusicRodion ShchedrinBased onBizet's CarmenPremiere20 April 1967 (1967-04-20)Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow
Carmen Suite is a one-act ballet created in 1967 by Cuban choreographer Alberto Alonso to music by Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin for his wife, prima ballerina assoluta Maya Plisetskaya. The premiere took place on 20 April 1967 at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow. The music, taken from Bizet's opera Carmen and arranged for strings and percussion, is not a 19th-century pastiche but rather ""a creative meeting of the minds,"" as Shchedrin put it, with Bizet's melodies reclothed in a variety of fresh instrumental colors (including the frequent use of percussion), set to new rhythms and often phrased with a great deal of sly wit. Initially banned by the Soviet hierarchy as ""disrespectful"" to the opera for precisely these qualities, the ballet has since become Shchedrin's best-known work and has remained popular in the West for what reviewer James Sanderson calls ""an iconoclastic but highly entertaining retelling of Bizet's opera.""[1]


Structure[edit]
The ballet is in one act containing 13 dance numbers:

I. Introduction: Andante assai
II. Dance: Allegro
III. First Intermezzo: Allegro moderato - Andante moderato - (attacca)
IV. Changing of the Guard: Moderato
V. Carmen's Entrance and Habanera: Allegro moderato - Quasi andante
VI. Scene: Allegro moderato - Tempo precedente - Andante assai
VII. Second Intermezzo: Larghetto
VIII. Bolero: Allegro vivo
IX. Torero: Moderato con stoltezza
X. Torero and Carmen: Lento - Tempo I
XI. Adagio: Andante moderato - Adagio
XII. Fortune-Telling: Andantino - Andante assai
XIII. Finale: Allegro - Tempo precedente - Andante assai
Instrumentation[edit]
A standard string orchestra of violins, violas, cellos, double basses is augmented by a percussion battery of one timpanist and four members, who play the following:
Player 1: marimba, vibraphone, xylophone, castanets, three cowbells, four bongos, tubular bells, snare drum, guiro
Player 2: vibraphone, marimba, snare drum, tambourine, two woodblocks, claves, triangle, guiro
Player 3: glockenspiel, crotales, maracas, whip, snare drum, cabasa, guiro, three temple blocks, bass drum, tam-tam, tenor drum, triangle
Player 4: cymbals, bass drum, tam-tam, hi-hat, triangle, tambourine, five tom-toms
Two factors influenced Shchedrin in choosing this instrumentation. The first, he said in an interview with BBC Music Magazine, was that, ""to be [as] totally far [as possible]"" from Bizet's scoring for the opera, he wanted an ensemble ""without brass and woodwind... that gave me many possibilities"" for timbral variety. The second was the high level of string and percussion players then available in the Bolshoi orchestra.[2]

Composition[edit]
Rodion Shchedrin with his wife, Maya Plisetskaya, in 2009. He wrote Carmen Suite for Plisetskaya
The idea for Carmen Suite originated with Shchedrin's wife, Bolshoi Theatre ballerina Maya Plisetskaya. In 1964, she asked composer Dmitri Shostakovich to compose a ballet on the story of Carmen, since, Shchedrin said, they were both on good terms with him.[2] Shostakovich ""gently but firmly refused,"" Plisetskaya remembers. ""I'm afraid of Bizet,"" he told her half-jokingly. ""Everyone is so used to the opera that whatever you write, you'll disappoint them."" He suggested that perhaps Shchedrin could ""come up with something special"" to fulfill her request. Instead, she went to Aram Khachaturian, the composer of the ballets Gayane and Spartacus, but ""things never went beyond talking.""[3] Shchedrin added that Khachaturian told Plisetskaya, ""Why you need me? You have a composer at home, ask him!"" It was then, he said, that she asked him to write the music.[2]
In late 1966, the Ballet Nacional de Cuba stopped in Moscow during its Soviet tour. Plisetskaya's mother attended its performances and encouraged her to go. Eventually, Plisetskaya approached the company's choreographer, Alberto Alonso and told him of her desire for a Carmen ballet.[4][5] Alonso developed the libretto and worked with Ballet Nacional dancers on the choreography, then flew to Moscow to teach the work to Plisetskaya. Shchedrin watched her initial rehearsals with Alonso and agreed to write music for the ballet.[6]
However, as much as he struggled to write an original score for this project, Shchedrin found he could not extricate the story from the music that French composer Georges Bizet wrote for his opera of the same name, a score Shchedrin called ""fantastic, one of the best in the whole history of music.""[2] Eventually, Shchedrin decided to exploit this connection in what he called ""a creative meeting of the minds.""[7] With Shostakovich's words in mind, Shchedrin said, ""I had to combine ... something fresh ... with these famous melodies."" From this motive came the idea to use just strings and percussion for the instrumentation ""because then it is a totally modern combination.""[2] His intent was to give homage to what Bizet had done and acknowledge the universality of his music in telling the story of Carmen while adding his own ideas to the work. In this way, Andrew Lindemann Malone writes in his description of the ballet, Shchedrin positioned him on a creative middle ground, ""making himself if not an equal partner at least something above the level of arranger.""[8]
Toward this end, Shchedrin set Bizet's music with a number of clever and unexpected rhythmic twists and subtler changes in notes and chords. This gives the impression of simultaneously recognizing something familiar and being surprised in hearing something slightly distorted about it. Some melodies are ""combined for 'found' counterpoint,"" Malone writes, others interrupted and still more left unaccompanied where Shchedrin assumes the listener knows both music and story all too well. An instance of the last mentioned, Malone writes, is ""when a big whipped-up climax in the Torero scene leads to nothing but the lowest percussion, pumping quietly, merrily, and obliviously along.""[8] He also adds a number of humorous touches, such as the off-color use of the ""Farandole"" from Bizet's incidental music to L'Arlésienne and the sudden, unexpected hesitations in the Toreador Song.[1] None of these changes obfuscate either the general melodic curves of Bizet's music—all the familiar tunes are easily recognizable—or the intricacies of the plot.[8]
Shchedrin's orchestration proved equally unexpected and creative. Eschewing the full orchestra of Bizet for one of strings and an enlarged percussion section, he ""boldly overhauled"" the orchestral sound, as Sanderson phrases it, with a greatly widened timbrel range enhancing the sharpened rhythms and sudden hairpin turns in phrasing and mood.[1] The Habanera, Malone says, is introduced ""in a bouncy duet"" for vibraphone and tympani, while various percussion instruments accentuate separate notes in the ""Changing of the Guard"" scene to ""unexpectedly rattle"" the melodic line.""[8] The full extent of Shchedrin's emendations and their faithfulness to Bizet and the story, Malone writes, are both shown in the finale of the ballet: ""melodies get twisted, thrown to exotic percussion, and otherwise trampled, but the resulting music, with its passionate climax and coda of distant bells and pizzicato strings, still has gravity and depth, due both to Bizet and to Shchedrin's interventions.""[8]

Roles[edit]
Carmen, a gypsy woman
Don José, corporal of Dragoons
Escamillo, a bullfighter (toreador)
Zúñiga, captain of Dragoons
Fate
Magistrate

Synopsis[edit]
Place: Seville, Spain, and surrounding hills
Time: Around 1820
Alonso's scenario centers on Carmen, Don José and the bullfighter Escamillo. Carmen is a passionate, free-spirited woman in contrast to the temperamental and fickle Don José. Fate, a ballerina dressed in black and a representation of Carmen's alter ego, tells Carmen's fortune with a deck of cards. A fight with tobacco dealers leads to Carmen's arrest by Captain Zúñiga. In jail, she seduces Don José and convinces him to release her. Carmen is subsequently caught in a love triangle between Don José and popular bullfighter Escamillo.[6]
Boris Messerer's sets included a mock bullring which symbolizes life, uniting the bullfight and Carmen's destiny in a sinister personage.[4] Masked spectators and a uniformed judge represent society's disapproval for the unconventional behavior of Carmen and her lovers. Fate reappears in the final act playing the role of a bull and the three main characters meet in the arena. Carmen dances alternatively with Fate, Escamillo and Don José until she is stabbed. She dies caressing Don José's face, revealing him as the assassin.[6]

Official ban[edit]
The Bolshoi premiered Carmen Suite in 1967 but the fact that Bizet's music was so well-known actually worked against its favor, at first. Soviet Minister of Culture Yekaterina Furtseva, was repelled by the modernist flavor given to the music and the sexual overtones of both the story and the title character. She banned the work immediately following its premiere as ""insulting"" to Bizet's masterpiece.[7] Explaining this, Furtseva commented to Soviet media, ""We cannot allow them to make a whore out of Carmen, the heroine of the Spanish people."" (Unfortunately for Furtseva, her words were taken as a joke among the Moscow public following the controversy.[9]) When she met privately at the Bolshoi with Plisetskaya and other members, Furtseva called Carmen Suite ""a great failure,"" the production ""raw. Nothing but eroticism. The opera's music has been mutilated. The concept has to be rethought. I have grave doubts as to whether the ballet can be redone.""[10]
Not long after the meeting with Furtseva, Shostakovich called the ministry about Carmen Suite. He told Furtseva that he considered the ballet both a masterly transcription and highly effective dance music.[10] At this time, Shostakovich was First Secretary of the Composer's union of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR); this made him effectively leader of that union. Even if it were not meant as an official call and regardless of his official position still being subservient to hers, the fact it was Shostakovich calling might have still carried some cachet.[11] Because of this personal intervention, the ban was lifted.[12] Plisetskaya confessed in her autobiography that without Shostakovich's help, the ban on Carmen Suite might have remained permanent.[13]
Shostakovich's call did not end all official interference with the ballet, however. Carmen Suite had been planned for the Bolshoi's upcoming tour of Canada as part of Expo 67, scheduled to be held in Toronto. In fact, the Canadian impresario assisting with the Bolshoi on the tour, Nikolai Kudryavtsev, had specifically requested it and felt it would be highly appropriate.[14] Kudryavtsev, assured by the Ministry of Culture that Carmen Suite would be included, booked the Maple Leaf Gardens and began advertising Plisetskaya's appearance in it, expecting a full audience of 6,000. However, when he arrived in Moscow in July 1967 to sign contracts, he was told that Furtseva had seen the ballet and decided it would not be shown in Canada. The objection at that time appeared to be that Plisetskaya had danced in ""very abbreviated black tights.""[15]
Two weeks later, Kudryavtsev, who was then in Vienna, was asked by the Soviets to a meeting at Furtseva's office in Moscow. The meeting lasted from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM and consisted mainly, as he recalled later to Canadian poet and diplomat Robert Ford, of ""a running battle between Plisetskaya and Furtseva.""[16] Furtseva told Plisetskaya that not only would Carmen Suite not be included but that she was to tell the foreign press that the work was not ready to be performed. When told this, Plisetskaya refused to go on tour and that if she were forced to do so, she would tell the foreign press the truth about Carmen Suite.[17] At one point, Kudryavtsev remembered,  Furtseva accused Shchedrin of plagiarism for claiming Carmen Suite ""was his own work when 'everyone knew that it had been written by a French composer, Bizet.'"" Plisetskaya demanded that Furtseva withdraw this charge or she would never dance again, either in the Soviet Union or abroad. Kudryavtsev told Ford that Furtseva said this was fine by her as Plisetskaya was too old to continue dancing anyway.[18] Plisetskaya, in her version of the meeting, said that Furtseva ""screeched"" that Plisetskaya would be ""a traitor to classical ballet"" by leaving, to which she did not reply. As it turned out, Plisetskaya became seriously ill and could not go on the tour. Carmen Suite was not performed but the sets were shipped regardless.[17][a 1]
With its sets still abroad, Carmen Suite could not be performed for the 50-year celebration of the October Revolution. Once they were returned, the Bolshoi was allowed to stage the ballet, which became popular with Moscow audiences. In 1968, Premier Alexei Kosygin saw and praised it. When a tour of Great Britain was scheduled for later that year and the British impresario requested Carmen Suite, the Ministry of Culture agreed.[19]

Critical reactions[edit]
In the April 1969 issue of Gramophone, reviewer Edward Greenfield called Carmen Suite ""A real curiosity"" and, while ""a skilful hotchpotch on popular themes [that] has its attractions,"" it was ""Not the sort of thing, then, that is going to endear itself to the US State Department""—a nod to the work's Soviet-Cuban roots and the Cold War climate prevailing at the time.[20] More recent commentators seem to have taken the ballet's tongue-in-cheekiness more in stride. In his review of the Kremlin Chamber Orchestra recording, Sanderson calls the ballet ""an iconoclastic but highly entertaining retelling of Bizet's opera,""[1] and John Armstrong, in his BBC Music review of the Mikhail Pletnev–Russian National Orchestra recording, writes that in Carmen Suite, ""you get all the familiar tunes dressed up in a way Bizet would never have imagined, and with a sly grin and a twinkle in the eye.""[7] The music is still not universally loved, though. In his review of the Pletnev recording, Raymond Tuttle calls Shchedrin's efforts ""a sort of classical 'bachelor pad' takeover, half lurid and half disturbing, of Bizet's immortal soul"" and notes ""the score's incipient vulgarity"" and ""grotesque elements.""[21]
Like the music, the ballet still comes under critical fire at times. In a New York Times 2011 review of the Mariinsky staging, Alastair Macaulay faults Alonso for turning ""the dance impulse in Bizet’s music into something heavier and more clumsily expressionistic,"" then adds,

Nothing about ""Carmen Suite"" is remotely subtle, though the narrative makes Carmen look considerably more dishonest about her change of erotic allegiance (from José to the Torero) than in the opera. The characters keep posing for us and one another; steps are hurled flamboyantly, like stunts. Early on it seems Carmen is the bullfighter aiming her darts at first one lover, then the next; but a final quartet — featuring her, José, the Torero and Fate — proceeds through a certain amount of partner changing until Carmen lies dead at José’s feet and Fate at the Torero’s. (It’s not often that you come away feeling Fate got a rough deal.)[22]

CarnavalMichel Fokine in costume for Carnaval, circa 1910ChoreographerMichel FokineMusicRobert SchumannLibrettoMichel FokinePremiere20 February 1910Pavlov Hall, Saint Petersburg, RussiaOriginal ballet companyImperial BalletCharactersColumbineHarlequinChiarinaEstrellaPapillonPierrotFlorestanEusebiusDesignLéon BakstSettinganteroom of a ballroom
Carnaval (Russian: Карнавал) is a ballet based on the music of Robert Schumann's piano suite Carnaval, Op. 9, as orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Anatoly Lyadov and Alexander Tcherepnin. It was choreographed by Michel Fokine to his own libretto, with costumes designed by Léon Bakst, and premiered in Pavlovsk on 5 March (old style, 20 February) 1910.
The leading dancers of the Imperial Ballet were engaged in the production: Tamara Karsavina (Columbine), Leonid Leontiev (Harlequin), Vera Fokina (Chiarina), Ludmilla Schollar (Estrella), Bronislava Nijinska (Papillon), Vsevolod Meyerhold (Pierrot), Vasily Kiselev (Florestan), and Alexander Shiryaev (Eusebius).
The ballet became world-famous due to its production by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes (Theater des Westens, Berlin, 20 May 1910), with new sets and costumes by Bakst, with Lydia Lopokova as Columbine and Fokine himself as Harlequin.


History[edit]
Carnaval was created in three spontaneous rehearsals in 1910 for a charity performance in Pavlov Hall, Saint Petersburg, to benefit the magazine Satirikon.
When Michel Fokine was approached by two young men involved in the publication (Mikhail Kornfeld, later to be its publisher, and the later-famous poet Grigory Potemkin) they gave him free rein, although they mentioned that the theme of the event was to be carnival. The choreographer immediately thought of Schumann's Carnaval suite for piano, which he had long admired.
On 14 September 1933, the ballet was revived in London by the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo (staged by Woizikovsky) for Alexandra Danilova (appearing as Columbine).[citation needed] In 1937, it was staged by the Vic-Wells Ballet with Margot Fonteyn playing the role of Columbine.[1]

Score[edit]
The score has musical references to Frédéric Chopin and Niccolò Paganini, literary ones to the four commedia dell'arte characters Harlequin, Columbina, Pierrot and Pantalone, and stage directions written in after it was completed.
There are also autobiographical references to Ernestine von Fricken, with whom Schumann was in love when he was very young, to Clara Schumann, his wife, and in the final section of the music, entitled ""Marche des Davidsbündler contre les Philistines"", to the composer's advocacy of the ""new"" art, as against the conservation of the old. The Davidsbündler was an artistic society invented by Schumann as a foil to the conservative musical establishment.

Libretto[edit]
Costume sketch by Léon Bakst, for the 1910 production
The libretto was put together by Michel Fokine and Léon Bakst and has no real plot; rather it is a series of light, humorous, and joyous incidents combined with some moments of poignancy and an undercurrent of satire.
The four characters of the commedia are complemented by Florestan, representing the impulsive side of Schumann's nature, Eusebius, the thoughtful solitary side,[2] Estrella (Ernestine), Chiarina (Clara), Papillon, a fluttering lady, six light-hearted couples, and four Philistines.
For the gallant males, coquettish females, and lovers who teasingly accept and reject each other, Fokine devised numerous pas de deux, pas de trois and pas seuls.

Costumes and sets[edit]
They illustrate another instance where the role of the designer, in this case Bakst, was of utmost importance.
His sketches for the costumes gave Fokine further inspiration for the finely etched characters he created. The simple set—the ante-room of a ballroom delineated by a curtain running all around the stage and up to the flies, with two chandeliers and two small striped sofas—as well as the costumes, were designed in the style of Biedermeier.
Even the traditional commedia dell'arte figures were altered slightly to fit this viewpoint. The set had evidently the effect of making the dancers appear smaller – thus making the audience feel even more strongly that they were watching a finely tuned miniature.

Analysis[edit]
This section is written like a personal reflection, personal essay, or argumentative essay that states a Wikipedia editor's personal feelings or presents an original argument about a topic. Please help improve it by rewriting it in an encyclopedic style. (August 2022) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Carnaval seems to have been the most delicate, most exquisite ballet Michel Fokine ever created, as well as the most difficult to pinpoint.
As was the case with many of his works, the roles depended to a large degree upon the talents of the original performers, and if one looks at just the steps (except for the one Harlequin solo) they are almost simplistic. It was the infusion of lightness, gaiety, coyness, and self-absorption, combined with an underlying sadness—all of which must be contributed by the dancers—that resulted in what most critics of the time regarded as a most effective adaptation of Schumann's music and characters.
Recent attempts to reconstruct the work in England, Sweden, and the United States have had varying degrees of success. This is because the roles must be created from within each individual performer, not from externally imposed steps or gestures. They require someone like Fokine himself to elicit this from the dancers – an almost impossible task.
In the middle of the 1930s, Fokine complained that all the delicacy and charm disappeared from the Carnaval ""because the world had changed and the woman was not the same"". Fokine explained: ""In the past, the woman was saying 'Don't touch me!' and now their whole appearance says, 'Touch me' or even 'I beg you'.""[3]

Carnival of the AnimalsChoreographerChristopher WheeldonMusicCamille Saint-SaënsLibrettoJohn LithgowPremiereMay 14, 2003 (2003-05-14)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignJon MorrellNatasha KatzSettingAmerican Museum of Natural History
Carnival of the Animals is a ballet choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon to the Le Carnaval Des Animaux by Saint-Saëns, with narrations written by John Lithgow, costumes and sets designs by Jon Morrell and lighting designed by Natasha Katz. It premiered on May 14, 2003, at the New York State Theater, performed by the New York City Ballet.[1] The ballet is about a little boy who falls asleep at the American Museum of Natural History and dreams of people he knew as animals.


Synopsis[edit]
Oliver Pendleton Percy III, a little boy, falls asleep during a visit to the American Museum of Natural History.[2][3] In his dream, people he knows are transformed to animals, such as his great aunt who is also a former ballerina as the swan, the librarian as a kangaroo who dreams of being a mermaid, his teacher as the lion, and his worried parents as cuckoos.[3] The narrator appears as the school nurse who transforms into a female elephant.[2]

Production[edit]
Christopher Wheeldon and John Lithgow met in 2002 when the two worked on the musical Sweet Smell of Success as choreographer and actor respectively. After that, Wheeldon invited Lithgow, who is also an author, to write the narrations and perform in his ballet Carnival of the Animals.[4] When the ballet premiered, Lithgow appeared as the narrator, school nurse and a female elephant.[3] Jon Morrell designed the costumes and sets, and Natasha Katz designed the lighting.[2]
The ballet is set in the American Museum of Natural History, which Wheeldon visits frequently due to its ""amazing mix of the grotesque and the wonderful"".[5]  Wheeldon had said that since the start of the creative process, it was determined that the performers are ""people first, then animals"", and he ""wanted to move away from the clichéd bunny ears and fluffy tails"", therefore the animal characteristics are only subtly implied.[5]
Lithgow returned for the New York City Ballet's appearance at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in July 2003,[6] and at the 2005 revival, for which he took time off from the musical Dirty Rotten Scoundrels to do so.[7] He also appeared in the Houston Ballet and Pennsylvania Ballet productions in 2007 and 2008 respectively.[4][8] In the 2013 New York City Ballet revival, actor Jack Noseworthy served as the narrator.[9]

Children's book and CD[edit]
Lithgow's children's book and accompanying CD of the same name was released in 2004.[10]

Original cast[edit]
The original cast includes Lithgow, appearing as the school nurse and an elephant, and School of American Ballet student P.J. Verhoest, who plays Oliver Pendleton Percy III. The rest of the cast are New York City Ballet dancers, with the principal roles originated by:[2]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Caroline Mathilde is a two-act ballet to music by Sir Peter Maxwell Davies. Its original choreographer was Flemming Flindt in 1991.
It tells the story of the eighteenth-century English princess Caroline Mathilde (sister of George III), who in 1766 was sent to Denmark aged 15 to be married to the 17-year-old schizophrenic Danish king, Christian VII. The ballet portrays her unhappy marriage, the king's growing madness and her fatal love-affair with Struensee, the king's influential physician, which ultimately leads to their arrest, his execution and her exile at the age of 20, separated from her two young children.
As with Davies' earlier ballet, Salome, it was a commission by the Royal Danish Ballet. It was first performed on 14 March 1991 at the Royal Danish Theatre, Copenhagen. The orchestra was conducted by Markus Lehtinen.
Davies prepared two concert suites, each based on an act of the ballet.

Carousel (A Dance) is a ballet made by New York City Ballet resident choreographer Christopher Wheeldon to the music of Carousel Waltz and If I Loved You (1945) by Richard Rodgers, arranged and orchestrated by William David Brohn. The music used in the ballet is from Rodgers and Hammerstein's classic 1945 musical Carousel. The premiere took place Tuesday, 26 November 2002, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center.[1]


Production[edit]
Carousel (A Dance) was commissioned as part of New York City Ballet's gala celebrating Richard Rodgers's centennial, and was not intended to be revived afterwards, though the positive reviews led to its revivals. The ballet is set to music from the 1945 musical Carousel, but it is pure dance rather than a narrative ballet. The ballet shows a love pas de deux between the lead couple, highlighted from the corps de ballet. The ballet was added to Pacific Northwest Ballet's repertoire in 2009.[1][2][3]

73,Cave of the Heart,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cave_of_the_Heart,"Cave of the Heart , Samuel Barber , 1947","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Cave of the Heart is a one-act ballet choreographed by Martha Graham to music (Medea suite) by Samuel Barber.[1] It was first performed on May 10, 1946, with the title Serpent Heart, at the second annual Festival of Contemporary American Music in the McMillin Theater of Columbia University. Serpent Heart was commissioned by the festival sponsor, The Alice M. Ditson Fund.[2]

Overview[edit]
The piece is loosely based on Euripides' tragedy Medea.[3] The choreography is rich in Jungian symbolism, an important influence on Graham.[4] According to the 1946 program notes, the work is “much like the myth of Jason, the warrior hero, and Medea, granddaughter of the sun…a dance of possessive and destroying love…”[2] The four-person original cast included Graham as One Like Medea, Erick Hawkins as One Like Jason, Yuriko as The Princess and May O’Donnell as The Chorus.[5]  The set was designed by Isamu Noguchi, the costumes by Edythe Gilfond.[2]
The ballet is approximately 28 minutes in length with seven movements/parts: Parados, Choros, Young Princess Dance and Dance of Jason, Choros, Medea's dance, Kanticos Agomas and Exodus (with fanfare of trumpets).[6] The dance is part of Graham's “Greek Cycle,” which also includes Night Journey, a retelling of the Oedipus story, Errand into the Maze, and Clytemnestra, a ballet based on the Oresteia.[7]The New York Times reviewer John Martin found the original ballet more of a draft than a finished work and thought the story missed the “force of the Medea myth, because here the Medea kills only the daughter of the king, who is her rival for Jason’s love…In the myth itself, she kills her own children in order to torture Jason, their father. There is almost too much wrath and passion here for so usual a denouement.” Martin deemed the music “brilliant” and the set “remarkable.”[2]
The ballet was revised and renamed by Graham for the following season. Cave of the Heart was first performed on 27 February 1947, at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York.  It featured the same cast but different character names: Graham as The Sorceress, Hawkins as The Adventurer and Yuriko as The Victim. The name of O’Donnell's character, The Chorus, remained the same.[5] Graham invented one of her signature movements for the ballet, a step subsequently known as the ""cave turn."" The motion is a swooping heads-down spin in arabesque penché with a torso contraction.[8]
John Martin critiqued the premiere of Cave of the Heart for the February 28 edition of the Times. He described the piece as “greatly strengthened” but added it would “probably never rank among the masterpieces of the Graham repertoire.”[9] Graham's ballet begins well into the myth, when abandoned by Jason and exiled from her home, The Sorceress (Medea) plots revenge on her husband and her rival. Inflamed by jealousy, she murders the princess, Jason's new wife, and kills her own two children. Donning a metal garment of flame-like spikes, she becomes symbolically trapped in a prison of her imagining.[10]
Cave of the Heart was one of Graham's favorite dances.[11] Despite the anti-heroine's dark and brutal nature, the piece is ultimately a tale of transformation, as The Sorceress, cleansed by fire, returns to her father the Sun. Cave of the Heart is still in the Graham Dance Company repertory.[1] It is one of the troupe's most enduring ballets and is considered a classic.[7] The documentary film An Evening of Conversation and Dance with Martha Graham includes Cave of the Heart, as well as Errand into the Maze (1947) and Acts of Light (1981).[12]

The Cellist is a one-act ballet about British cellist Jacqueline du Pré, choreographed by Cathy Marston, with the scenario devised by Marston and Edward Kemp. The music was written by Philip Feeney and incorporated scores du Pré was best known for. The ballet is Marston's first Royal Ballet main stage production, and premiered on 17 February 2020 at the Royal Opera House,[1] with the title role danced by Lauren Cuthbertson. The work is set in England during the 1960s and 1970s.[2]


Production[edit]
Conception[edit]
Choreographer Cathy Marston had worked with The Royal Ballet since 1997, but never on its main stage until The Cellist.[3] She first had the idea of using a dancer as a cello when she was making Dangerous Liaison for the Royal Danish Ballet as she wanted to avoid props. She then considered to make a ballet with a cello.[4] When Royal Ballet artistic director Kevin O'Hare asked Marston to give suggestions for a ballet,[5] which would be her first main stage production for the company,[3] her sister, a drama teacher who let her students improv with a cello, proposed using Jacqueline du Pré as the subject.[4][5] Du Pré was regarded as one of the best cellists of all time, but her career was cut short due to multiple sclerosis (MS), and she died at age 42.[5] Marston's mother having MS was not a factor in choosing du Pré.[3]

Development[edit]
Before Marston started working on the ballet, she and O'Hare met du Pré's husband Daniel Barenboim in Berlin to have his blessing.[5][6] Marston recalled Barenboim ""was both charming and charmed by the idea,""[1] and according to O'Hare, Barenboim said, ""Make me handsome,"" at the end of the meeting.[7] Barenboim allowed Marston to portray him as the conductor, even though he was usually the pianist when he and du Pré performed together.[5] Marston also read books about du Pré and took cello classes ""to get a sense of the instrument,"" but believed that she would not continue after the ballet was complete.[1] She spoke to both people who knew du Pré and people with MS, including her mother.[3][8]
Marston devised the scenario of the ballet with Edward Kemp,[9] a frequent collaborator of her, and Kemp also served as the dramaturg.[4] She had no intention of exploring du Pré's private life,[5] and wanted to focus on the ""love and loss"" between her with her cello,[1] therefore the ballet is deliberately titled The Cellist.[4] The ballet also explores ""what it means to be an artist and find your voice"" rather than ""technical quality.""[8]
Like Dangerous Liaison, Marston chose to use a male dancer to personify the cello,[3] and described the role as ""the instrument, and music personified, and to some extent fate.""[4] The corps de ballet is used as ""A Chorus of Narrators"" and appears as the orchestra, the audience,[9] friends,[10] and MS symptoms which Marston said was ""from an experiential rather than a scientific point of view,"" especially the ""long period of anxiety"" du Pré had before her diagnosis.[1]
The music was a commissioned score by Philip Feeney, which incorporated some of the music du Pré was best known for.[4] Originally, Elgar's Cello Concerto was not included, but Marston decided to include a scene with Barenboim conducting du Pré the concerto, which never happened. Upon Barenboim's approval, Feeney rewrote the score.[4] In the final product, the Elgar concerto is featured prominently.[1] At the premiere, solo cellist Hetty Snell performed in the orchestra pit.[11]
The set was designed by Hildegard Bechtler and was inspired by the inside of a cello. Bregje van Balen, a former dancer, designed the costumes.[4]

Dancers[edit]
In the original production, Lauren Cuthbertson was cast as du Pré (credited as ""The Cellist).[12] Marston had wanted to work with Cuthbertson since 2002, when a 17-year-old Cuthbertson stepped in last minute to dance the central role in a new Marston piece.[8] Cuthbertson did in-depth research,[5] studied cello and spoke to MS patients in preparation for the role.[13]
Marcelino Sambé portrayed ""The Instrument"",[12] and Marston commented, ""His body is so supple, movement just bursts out of him. If you were going to personify music – that’s him.""[8] Barenboim (""The Conductor"") was danced by Matthew Ball.[12] Ball said playing Barenboim was ""quite intimidating,"" and his portrayal was from ""a slightly more innocent time.""[5]
Other dancers who had performed at the premiere included Royal Ballet School student Emma Lucano as the young cellist,[14] Thomas Whitehead as her father,[12] Kristen McNally as her mother,[15] Anna Rose O'Sullivan as her sister,[16] and Gary Avis as a teacher.[12] The second cast include Beatriz Stix-Brunell as the Cellist, Calvin Richardson as the Instrument and Ball as the Conductor.[17]

Critical reception[edit]
The Cellist received positive to mixed reviews. In a five-star review, The Telegraph's Mark Monahan wrote, ""Magical, supremely romantic (Romantic, even), and stirring right from the start, The Cellist – co-created with dramaturg Edward Kemp – is a supreme case in point.""[12] Lyndsey Winship of The Guardian gave it four stars, and commented, ""The Cellist is most effective as a portrait of a woman’s deep love affair with music.""[15] Will Gompertz of the BBC also gave it four stars and called it ""beautiful"".[18] The Times's Debra Craine gave it three stars and was more critical: ""too long and sags in the middle,""[19] while the Evening Standard's Emma Byrne commented that the corps de ballet was ""cluttered, distracting – and unnecessarily busy.""[20]

75,Chaconne,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaconne_(ballet%29,"Chaconne , to music by Christoph Willibald Gluck , 1976","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Chaconne is a ballet made by New York City Ballet co-founder and ballet master George Balanchine to ballet music from Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice (Vienna, 1762; Paris, 1774). The premiere took place Wednesday, 22 January 1976 at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, with lighting by Ronald Bates; Robert Irving conducted. Chaconne was danced in practice clothes at its premiere; Karinska's costumes were added in the spring season.
The finale to Orfeo ed Euridice is a chaconne, a dance form built on a short bass phrase and often used by 17th and 18th century opera composers to achieve a festive mood at the end. The choreography was first performed at the Hamburgische Staatsoper in their 1963 production of Orpheus und Eurydike and somewhat altered in Chaconne, especially that for the principal dancers. Balanchine added the pas de deux for Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins to the 1976 ballet and the opening ensemble (to the 1774 Dance of the Blessed Spirits) for the Spring season.
Balanchine's first Orpheus and Eurydice was made on the Metropolitan Opera in 1936; his approach, the singers remaining in the pit while the action was danced on stage, was not well received; the production had only two performances. He choreographed Orphée et Eurydice for the Théâtre National de l'Opéra, Paris in 1973 and Orfeo ed Euridice for the Chicago Lyric Opera in 1975 as well.

The Chairman Dances is a ballet made by New York City Ballet ballet master in chief Peter Martins to John Adams' eponymous music from 1985. The music was originally written for Adams' opera, Nixon in China, but not used in production: the scene is that in which Mao Zedong dances with his future bride, movie star Chiang Ch'ing. The premiere took place on 14 May 1988, as part of City Ballet's American Music Festival at New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, with scenery and costumes by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, and lighting by Mark Stanley.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




CheckmateChoreographerNinette de ValoisMusicArthur BlissBased onChessPremiere15 June 1937Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, ParisOriginal ballet companyVic-Wells BalletCharactersBlack QueenRed KnightDeathRed KingRed Queenleader of the Black PawnsDesignEdward McKnight KaufferSettingChessboardGenreNeoclassical ballet
Checkmate is a one act ballet created by the choreographer Ninette de Valois and composer Arthur Bliss.  The idea for the ballet was proposed by Bliss, and subsequently produced by de Valois for the Vic-Wells Ballet.  It was first performed on 15 June 1937 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris.[1] Checkmate is widely regarded as de Valois' signature ballet and a cornerstone of the British ballet repertoire, being performed regularly by the Royal Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet.[2]


Overview[edit]
After World War I, Bliss developed an interest in ballet, after seeing the Ballets Russes of Sergei Diaghilev in London.  Bliss composed Checkmate for the Vic-Wells Ballet (later the Sadler's Wells Ballet), who produced the first performance at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in 1937.  Constant Lambert conducted the Orchestre Lamoureux,[3] and the premiere dancers included the following:

June Brae (Black Queen)
Harold Turner (Red Knight)
Michael Somes (Black Knight)
Frederick Ashton (Death)
Robert Helpmann (Red King)
Pamela May (Red Queen)
Margot Fonteyn (leader of the Black Pawns)
Annabel Farjeon (a pawn)[4]
The UK premiere of Checkmate was on 5 October 1937 at Sadler's Wells.  The music received its first radio broadcast performance on 15 October 1937, over the BBC.[5]

Sections[edit]
Prologue—The Players: Moderato maestoso
Dances of the Red Pawns: Allegro spirito scherzando
Dance of the Four Knights: Allegro moderato sempre robustamente
Entry of the Black Queen: L'istesso tempo
The Red Knight's Mazurka: Moderato giojosamente
Ceremony of the Red Bishops: Largamente (misticamente)
Entry of the Red Castles: Allegro molto deciso
Entry of the Red King and Queen: Grave
The Attack: Allegro impetuoso e brillante
The Duel: Maestoso moderato e molto appassionato
The Black Queen Dances: Allegretto dispettoso
Finale—Checkmate: Andante poco sostenuto—allegro vivace e feroce
Synopsis[edit]
The premise of the ballet is that the chess pieces become animated and act out human emotions.  The main conflict of the story concerns the Red Knight's love for the Black Queen.  In the Prologue, two chess players are shown, ready to do battle.  The player in gold represents Love and chooses the red side.  The player in black represents Death and takes the black side.
The ballet proper begins with the Red Pawns assembling on the chessboard.  The Red Knights arrive on the scene, afterwards joined by the Black Knights.  The Black Knights prostrate themselves at the entry of the Black Queen, who fills them with fear.  The Black Queen makes advances to the Red Knight and tosses him a rose, and the Red Knight becomes infatuated with the Black Queen.
The Red King and Red Queen arrive, with the old Red King requiring assistance.  An initial ""game"" between the two sides finishes as the Black Queen has the Red King in a ""check"" position.  This game leads to a duel between the Red Knight and the Black Queen, where the Red Knight is victorious over the Black Queen.  However, he cannot bring himself to kill her because of his love for her.  In one moment, he turns his back and recalls the rose from the Black Queen.  The Black Queen takes advantage and fatally stabs the Red Knight.  The funeral cortège for the Red Knight is described as ""Death leading, Love at the end of the procession"".[6]
The Black Queen then turns on the Red King, and the Black forces surround him.  The Red King has one last moment of recalling his youth before the Black Queen stabs him in the back with a spear, in the final ""checkmate"".

Ballet by Sergei Prokofiev
Set and costume designs by Mikhail Larionov for the 1921 premiere at the Théâtre de la Gaîté-Lyrique in Paris
Chout, Op. 21, is a ballet by Sergei Prokofiev. It was originally composed in 1915, then extensively revised at the request of Serge Diaghilev in 1921. The composer extracted an orchestral suite from it, Op. 21 bis. The ballet's full title is Tale of the Jester Who Outwits Seven Other Jesters (Russian: Сказка про шута, семерых шутов перешутившего, romanized: Skazka pro shuta, semerykh shutov pereshutivshego). The most commonly used title for the work is based on the French transliteration of the Russian word for ""jester"", shut.


Background[edit]
Chout was Prokofiev's first completed ballet score for Sergei Diaghilev.  Diaghilev had first commissioned Ala and Lolli but rejected the score submitted by Prokofiev.  Although the composer recast some of the music as the Scythian Suite, the projected ballet never saw the light of day.  Instead, Diaghilev asked Prokofiev to write a ballet based on a folk tale recorded by Alexander Afanasyev.  The story had been previously suggested to Diaghilev by Igor Stravinsky as a possible subject for a ballet, and Diaghilev and his choreographer Léonide Massine helped Prokofiev to shape this into a ballet scenario.
The story involves seven buffoons who all murder their wives after being told by an eighth buffoon that he has killed his own wife and brought her back to life with a magic whip and promises to do the same for them.  When he fails to deliver on his promise, the other buffoons seek revenge.  The principal buffoon is forced to disguise himself as a woman and is chosen for marriage by a wealthy merchant. He escapes after swindling the merchant out of 300 roubles.[1]
Prokofiev wrote the score in 1915.  Although Diaghilev was again not happy with the music, this time he was prepared to work with the composer to recast it into six scenes and retain the best parts of the music already written.  He also wanted new entr'actes to make the music play continuously.  This Prokofiev did, but not until 1920.  In the meantime, the ballet was not produced.  He revised the score while staying at Mantes-sur-Seine near Paris. He wrote the piano reduction while travelling by ship to the United States and finished the full score in early 1921 after his return to France.  He played through the score for Stravinsky in Paris, who liked it. Shortly afterwards, Diaghilev also approved the changes. Over 40 per cent of the original score was either deleted or rewritten, and the required additional entr'actes were composed.[2]
The first performance of the ballet was given by the Ballets Russes on 17 May 1921, at the Théâtre Municipal de la Gaîté, Paris, with choreography by Fyodor Slavinsky and supervision by Mikhail Larionov. The orchestra was conducted by the composer.[3]  It was fairly well received, however the London premiere on 9 June was bitterly attacked by audiences and critics alike.

Structure[edit]
The structure of the ballet is:

Scene 1: The Buffoon's Kitchen
Entr'acte 1
Scene 2: The Seven Clowns
Entr'acte 2
Scene 3: The Buffoon's Courtyard
Entr'acte 3
Scene 4: The Buffoon's Sitting Room
Entr'acte 4
Scene 5: The Buffoon's Bedroom
Entr'acte 5
Scene 6: In the Merchant's Garden
Suite[edit]
Although he initially thought that a symphonic suite of 12 movements would be too long, in 1922-23 Prokofiev arranged such a suite from the ballet, which was premiered in Brussels on 15 January 1924 under Frans Rühlmann.[2] The suite consists of:

The Buffoon and His Wife
Dance of the Wives
Fugue. The Buffoons Kill Their Wives
The Buffoon as a Young Woman
Third Entr'acte
Dance of the Buffoons' Daughters
Entry of the Merchant and His Welcome
In the Merchant's Bedroom
The Young Woman Becomes a Goat
Fifth Entr'acte and the Goat's Burial
The Buffoon and the Merchant Quarrel
Final Dance.[1]
The 12 movements take 35–40 minutes to play (as compared to an hour for the full ballet).
While neither the ballet nor the suite can be said to have found a large following, the suite is performed more often than the ballet.  The ballet was only presented once in the Soviet Union, in January 1928 under the Ukrainian title Blazen at the Kiev Theatre of Opera and Ballet under A. S. Orlov.  The music had to be reconstructed from the symphonic suite, minus the entr'actes, resulting in prolonged pauses.  Other attempts to stage it in the Soviet Union failed – Prokofiev refused to allow any changes.[4]  The suite has been recorded a number of times and has often been performed in concert, but it was not until the mid-1980s that Gennady Rozhdestvensky made the first recording of the entire music for the ballet.[5][better source needed]

Chroma is a one-act contemporary ballet created by Wayne McGregor for the Royal Ballet. The work received its premiere at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 17 November 2006. The ballet is performed to a combination of original music by Joby Talbot and arrangements of music by Jack White of the White Stripes, with orchestrations by Christopher Austin. The ballet was a great success, winning a number of awards, including the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production, and led to The Royal Ballet appointing McGregor as resident choreographer.


Production[edit]
External videos Wayne McGregor's Chroma – The Hardest Button to Button (The Royal Ballet), YouTube video
Chroma marks the second time Wayne McGregor choreographed for the Royal Opera House main stage, having previously created works for the Royal Opera House's Linbury Studio Theatre.[1][2] According to McGregor, it was created within three weeks, with four to five hours of rehearsals each day.[3] The ballet is performed by ten dancers; some of the original cast members went on to be McGregor's frequent collaborators, such as Edward Watson, Steven McRae and Eric Underwood. The original cast also featured several Royal Ballet lead dancers, some of whom were working with McGregor for the first time. The female dancers are completely off pointe.[2]
The music includes four pieces by British composer Joby Talbot, as well as Talbot's rearrangement of three songs by Jack White of the American rock band White Stripes, including ""Aluminum"", ""The Hardest Button to Button"", and ""Blue Orchid"".[1][4] The set was designed by British architect John Pawson, who was known for his minimalist style. Pawson was brought in after he was approached by McGregor to create ""amazing plain canvases in which anything can happen"". Chroma was the first time Pawson designed for a stage.[1][5]
The choreography, design, and music received critical acclaim, with The Times noting: ""McGregor’s Chroma is ravishing on all fronts"", and The Guardian writing that the ballet's ""tension between chaos and minimalism is extreme"".[6][7] The success of Chroma led to McGregor's appointment as resident choreographer of the Royal Ballet, a position that was previously held by Frederick Ashton and Kenneth MacMillan, thus making him the first contemporary artist and the only one without any ballet training to hold the post.[8]
The Royal Ballet has since revived Chroma and it has been performed on tour. Other ballet companies that have danced the piece include the National Ballet of Canada (2010), San Francisco Ballet (2011), Bolshoi Ballet (2011), and The Australian Ballet (2014).[1] In 2013, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater became the first modern dance troupe to perform Chroma.[9] In 2016, on the 10th anniversary of the premiere, the Royal Ballet performed Chroma alongside five dancers from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, including Jacqueline Green, Jamar Roberts and Rachael McLaren.[10][11]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Poster for the original production by Maurice Leloir.
Cigale is a divertissement-ballet in two acts by Jules Massenet to a scenario by Henri Cain. It was composed in Égreville during the summer of 1902, first published by Heugel in 1903 and premiered at the Opéra-Comique in Paris on 4 February 1904.[1] The first performance was part of a benefit programme for former musical and technical staff of the house, which raised over 10,000 francs. The programme having commenced with Bastien et Bastienne in a translation by Georges Hartmann and Henry Gauthier-Villars, also included Debussy's Damoiselle élue, with Mary Garden and J Passama, conducted by André Messager, a feature on musical interpretation under hypnosis by Professeur Magnin, poetry readings by Mlle Bartet and Coquelin ainé, songs from Yvette Guilbert, a selection of French operatic airs, a one-act pantomime entitled Feminissima with Jean Delvoye among the singers, and the 2nd act of Don Pasquale with Korsoff as Louise, Fugère as don Pasquale, Edmond Clément as Octave and Delvoye as the doctor.[2]
The premiere dancers in Cigale were Jeanne Chasles (grasshopper), Louis Mesmaecker (ant), Mlle G Dugué (poor woman), Mlle Mary (the friend), M Delehaye (bank messenger boy).[2] The angel's voice was Julie Girardon.[3] In the music, James Harding noted the use of an old French carol and ""deft variations on Au clair de la lune"".[4]
The story is inspired by Jean de la Fontaine's fable La cigale et la fourmi (a version of The Ant and the Grasshopper), and portrays ""Cigale"" (Cicada) as a charitable young woman who takes pity on ""La Pauvrette"" (The Poor Girl) and gives away her breakfast, bonnet and red umbrella, and finally her money. 
She is then ridiculed for her kindness by ""Madame Fourmi"" (Madam Ant), ticketed by ""Le Garçon de Banque"" (The Banker), and seduced by her ""Petit Ami"" (The Boyfriend). 
On a cold winter's night, Cigale, whose kindness and carefree nature has led her to lose what little she has, is refused shelter by Madame Fourmi. Her lover and the poor girl enter and dance under her red umbrella. She falls to the grounds and dies in the snow grasping her guitar but the ballet ends with her ascending to heaven with the angels.
Harding comments that ""The worldly fabulist would have been discomfited at seeing his grasshopper, now a true Massenetic heroine, dying of hunger in the snow surrounded by angels and the murmur of a celestial choir..."".[4] The style of the work ""a story in mime and dance"" mixes both poetry and humour.[3]
Cigale is rarely performed and is not part of the standard ballet repertory. The music was recorded by the National Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Richard Bonynge on 28-29 November 1978 in the Kingsway Hall London with Enid Hartle and the London Voices, and first released on a Decca LP in 1980, then re-issued on compact disc in 1989 and 2001.[5]

History[edit]
The libretto of Cinderella was criticized for putting more emphasis on spectacle than on drama and story-telling. Nevertheless, the production was an enormous success due to the ovation given to the Italian ballerina Pierina Legnani in the title role. On opening night she caused a sensation in the Mariinsky Theatre, and was universally praised by the St. Petersburg critics, with a critic of the Peterbugskaya gazeta reporting that her dancing reached a level of ""...unprecedented perfection."" The theatre critic for the Peterburgskii lpistok reported that Legnani executed ""...the most dizzying difficulties of ballet technique with absolute ease, without the least tension or fatigue..."", and that she ""...revealed such perfection of technique and such strength as are difficult to imagine."" He went on to state that Legnani ""...must unquestionably be counted among the greatest virtuosas of choreography which Petersburg had ever seen.""
The most celebrated scene of Cinderella was the ball in the throne room of the castle in the second act, which included an elaborate Grand Pas d'action for the characters Cinderella, the Prince, soloists and the corps de ballet. Also successful was the spectacular Night tableaux of Act III, representing the Nile, Granada and Paris with each number beginning by the dancers and scenery rising out of a lake at the back of the stage with the wave of the Good Fairy's wand.

Pierina Legnani in the title role of Cinderella. St. Petersburg, 1894
The premiere of Cinderella has the distinction of being the first performance of a ballet in Russia to feature a ballerina performing 32 consecutive fouettés en tournant, which was executed by Pierina Legnani in the title role. The ballet historian Konstantin Skalkovsky, who served as dance critic for the Peterburgskaya gazeta at the turn of the 20th century, reported on Legnani's feat: ""...in the last act Legnani positively outdid herself. When Emma Bessone danced the lead in ""The Haarlem Tulip"" she did 14 fouettés. In her variation Legnani performed 32 of them without stopping, and without traveling one inch! The public delightedly applauded the Ballerina and compelled her to repeat this variation as well. On the repetition she nevertheless did 28 fouettés. To count them became the favorite occupation of the public.""
Cinderella was later staged for the Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow by Lev Ivanov, with the first performance given on 31 July [O.S. 19 July] 1898. Ivanov supervised a revival of the second act for the farewell benefit performance of Pierina Legnani on 5 February [O.S. 23 January] 1901. This would prove to be the last performance of any part of the ballet.
Fitinhof-Schell's score for Cinderella was never published in any form. The only part of the score that is still heard is the female variation in polka rhythm danced in the Mariinsky Theatre's version of the so-called ""Le Corsaire Pas de Deux"".

Synopsis[edit]
ACT I – A large kitchen
Scene 1
At the rise of the curtain, Gianna the cook and her scullery maids are busy preparing dinner, but Gianna no sooner leaves the kitchen than the scullery maids abandon their duties and begin to dance and play with saucepans and skillets.
Gianna returns, sees their mischief and sternly orders them back to business; they pay her no heed and Gianna, drawn into their merriment, begins to dance with them. A bell is heard. Gianna now emphatically orders her helpers to calm down; in confusion, they rush back to their places.
Scene 2
Aloisa and Odette enter hurriedly, hunting for their little sister to help them dress for the ball. Seeing that Cinderella is not there, they order the scullery maids to find her at once. The sisters are in a frightful worry. The hour of their departure for the royal celebration is approaching and their toilettes are not yet finished; they begin to smarten themselves up, angry and astonished at Cinderella's absence.
Scene 3
Cinderella runs in holding a sheaf of straw; her sisters rush over to push and pinch her and make their poor sister suffer, then they order her to set right their toilettes, which Cinderella willingly tries to do. The sisters, now content, begin to dream and boast to one another of their successes at the ball. Making fun of Cinderella, they dance and force her to dance as well. Their parents enter and press their daughters to get ready to leave. In vain, Cinderella begs her parents and sisters to take her along. Her sisters laugh and her father orders her sternly to stay at home and tend to her chores.
Scene 4
Alone and sad, Cinderella dreams about the pleasures of the ball, imagining the dances, but realising that she cannot go, and hurries about her work. The hearth flares up; Cinderella watches astonished as living sparks fly out of the fireplace. They surround her; delighted, she admires them and dances with them.
Scene 5
The Good Fairy appears; Cinderella's godmother and protector. Amazed by the good will and patience with which Cinderella bears her undeserved debasement, she promises to grant her any wish. Cinderella asks to go to the royal ball. With pleasure the Fairy agrees, but on the condition that she stay no later than midnight: with the last stroke of twelve o'clock, all the luxuries granted her will disappear. Cinderella happily thanks the Good Fairy, at a wave of whose hand a brilliant cortège appears. Servant-fairies assist Cinderella in completing her toilette for the ball and putting on magnificent slippers. The Fairy, when Cinderella is properly dressed, gives her a lesson in deportment and hurries her off, reminding her of the condition she set.

ACT II – The Throne Room of the Castle
Scene 1
Courtiers have gathered to greet the King, and promenade in expectation of his arrival; a few make lively conversation about the celebration. The Master of Ceremonies announces the royal family; the courtiers hurry to their places.
Scene 2
The royal couple enters and take their places, Prince Charming standing next to them. The guests, including the Pignarole family, pay their profound respects to the Queen and King. The King, enraptured by the prettiness of Cavalier Pignarole's daughters, invites them to take a place next to the throne.
Scene 3
Just then the herald's trumpets sound, announcing guests from Moscow and Poland, who, charmed by their welcome, pay their respects to the King and take their places. The Chamberlain rushes in and announces the arrival of an unknown princess, accompanied by a brilliant retinue. General excitement; the Prince hastens to meet the stranger.
Scene 4
Cinderella enters; Prince Charming, respectfully offering his arm, presents her to the King, Queen and court. The onlookers are struck by the unknown princess's beauty and brilliant toilette. The Pignaroles are amazed at the stranger's striking likeness to their youngest daughter, who was left at home. The Prince lavishes his attentions on the newly arrived princess and the King and Queen invite her to take a place next to them; this causes Aloisa and Odette to bear her malice and to envy the unknown guest. The Prince orders the Master of Ceremonies to begin the ball; the Prince takes part, dancing only with the Princess, delighted by her beauty. Odette and Aloisa also take part in the dances and try to attract the Prince's attention, but he is charmed by Cinderella's beauty.

Design by Matvey Shishkov for act II of the Imperial Ballet's production of Cinderella, St. Petersburg, 1893
Scene 5
The clock begins to strike midnight. Cinderella, enchanted by the Prince's attentions, completely forgets the Good Fairy's condition. With the last stroke of twelve, she suddenly remembers and quickly retires at the moment her mother walks up to the Prince and engages him in conversation. Cinderella, whose rich attire has turned simple, tries to leave the royal palace unnoticed. The Prince, observing the beautiful stranger's disappearance, orders his chamberlain to follow her, but just then, a page enters and gives the Prince the slipper which the Princess lost. The Prince, admiring the slipper, orders it to be announced throughout the land that he will choose for his bride the woman whose foot the slipper fits.

ACT III – A Fantastic Garden in the Prince's Castle
Scene 1
Servants and pages, preparing for the Prince's celebration, walk through the garden from time to time. The Prince enters with his retinue, wanting to know if his wishes have been met and if the beautiful stranger has turned up. The chamberlain calms the Prince, adding that the Princess is probably there. Contended with the chamberlain's assurances, the Prince invites the King and Queen into the ball.
Scene 2
On the day after the ball, Cinderella, wishing to see the Prince again and to look for her lost slipper, comes to the royal garden. Hearing footsteps, she hides in the bushes, frightened, falls to her knees in despair and prays for her godmother to help her.
Scene 3
The Good Fairy appears, and wishing to help her favourite again, still reproaches her for disobeying and not coming home in time. Cinderella begs the Good Fairy's forgiveness and asks her to help. Trumpets sound; the herald announces that Prince Charming will choose as his bride the woman whose foot fits the slipper which was found. Cinderella wants to be at the celebration to see him again and begs the Fairy to let her go to the ball. The Fairy gladly agrees; they withdraw.
Scene 4
The King and Queen enter with the Prince and the others invited to the celebration. The Prince asks the assembled beauties to try on the slipper, but their efforts are in vain; the slipper does not fit any of them. The herald now announces the Good Fairy with Cinderella. The Prince suggests that Cinderella also try the slipper and, to the astonishment of all, the slipper fits and stays on her foot. The onlookers are struck by Cinderella's beauty and the Prince, delighted, declares his love to her; her sisters beg forgiveness for treating her badly. She forgives them and the heralds announce Cinderella as the Prince's bride. The entire court congratulates them.

Cinderella (Russian: Золушка, tr. Zolushka;  French: Cendrillon) Op. 87, is a ballet composed by Sergei Prokofiev to a scenario by Nikolai Volkov. It is one of his most popular and melodious compositions, and has inspired a great many choreographers since its inception. The piece was composed between 1940 and 1944. Part way through writing it Prokofiev broke off to write his opera War and Peace. The premiere of Cinderella was conducted by Yuri Fayer on 21 November, 1945, at the Bolshoi Theatre, with choreography by Rostislav Zakharov[2] and Galina Ulanova in the title role. Cinderella is notable for its jubilant music, lush scenery, and for the comic double-roles of the stepmother and the two stepsisters (which can be performed in travesti), more mad than bad in this treatment.


Story[edit]
Act I
Cinderella, a young woman whose domineering stepmother forces her to act as a servant in her own home, helps her stepmother and two stepsisters to prepare for the Spring Ball, at which it is rumoured that the Prince will choose his bride-to-be. As the two stepsisters work together to produce a new shawl, they get into an argument over who will wear it, and end up tearing it in two through their bickering. The pair storm off, while the step-mother orders Cinderella to clear up the remnants and finish her chores, as her father returns home from business. Since her father's remarriage, Cinderella has had to sleep by the kitchen fireplace, leaving her nothing to wear but rags covered in ashes. Her father has never moved past the grief of his first wife's death, and though he is concerned for his only daughter Cinderella, he is just as much under the stepmother's control as Cinderella herself is. Their brief peace is interrupted, however, as the stepmother and the two stepsisters reenter and begin ordering them about. During supper, a beggar woman turns up, asking for shelter. The two stepsisters and the stepmother try to chase her off, but Cinderella offers her a place by the kitchen fire and an old pair of slippers. The beggar thanks her for her kindness and departs, leaving the preparations for the ball to resume. After choosing dresses and a quick dancing lesson, the family finally sets off for the night with the father reluctantly in tow, leaving Cinderella behind.
Although lonely at first, she cheers herself up by dancing with her broom, imagining the Prince himself has asked her for a dance. She is surprised, however, when the old beggar woman appears out of nowhere, wishing to return the slippers with her thanks. To Cinderella's amazement, the shoes have been transformed into dancing slippers of glass. The old beggar woman throws off her disguise and reveals herself as Cinderella's fairy godmother, come to grant her wish of going to the ball. Summoning the fairies of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter for assistance, she turns Cinderella's rags into a beautiful dress, a pumpkin and mice into a carriage and horses, and grasshoppers and dragonflies into a retinue of footmen. As she is about to leave, however, the fairy godmother warns her that the magic will only last until midnight, at which time the spell will break, and everything will revert to its original form. Only the glass slippers will remain as a gift for her kindness. She then summons twelve dwarfs, who will appear to repeat her message if she has not left by midnight. With this warning in mind, Cinderella departs for the ball.
Act II
The Spring Ball is in full swing, with guests arriving from all over the kingdom and beyond to dance and pay respect to the Prince. The two stepsisters attempt to win favour with the royal court by showing off their dancing skills, but have less than successful results, much to their mother's dismay. The Prince then joins the celebrations, but finding state events such as the Spring Ball dull, and being reluctant to enter a marriage without love, he declines any offers for a dance, particularly in the case of the obnoxious step-sisters.

Cinderella by Frederick Ashton, Polish National Ballet, Warsaw 2010
Cinderella arrives at the palace, transformed beyond recognition into a beautifully dressed princess. The Prince, along with everyone else, is entranced by her beauty and charm, and for the first time, he asks for a dance. As the evening passes, Cinderella quickly becomes beloved by the entire court for her graciousness and charm, and the enamoured Prince spends the entire evening by her side. When refreshments are served, he gives her the honour of taking one of three oranges, a delicacy imported to the kingdom from a far-off land. Cinderella offers the other two oranges to her two stepsisters, who are so flattered by the attention that they do not recognize the beautiful stranger as their stepsister. The Prince takes Cinderella out to the royal gardens for an evening walk, where they dance and proclaim the love blossoming between them.
As they return to the ballroom for the next waltz, Cinderella has completely forgotten about the time in her happiness. However, at the first stroke of midnight, the twelve dwarfs spring from the great palace clock and remind Cinderella of her fairy godmother's warning. Terrified of being unmasked as a lowly servant in rags, she flees from the ballroom to the astonishment of the other guests. Though the Prince pursues her, she vanishes into the night moments before the spell breaks, losing one of her glass slippers in her haste and panic. The Prince is heartbroken at the thought of losing his love so soon after discovering her, but upon finding the lost slipper, he vows not to rest until he is once again reunited with her.
Act III
The morning after the ball, the Prince summons every shoemaker in the kingdom, in order to find out who the slipper was made for. However, none of them claim to have crafted the shoe, or sold it to anybody recently, and he concludes that the princess must be from a foreign land. His desperate search brings him first to the Mediterranean, then to the Orient, and lands further beyond. After travelling across the world and meeting various beautiful princesses with no success, the Prince begins to search his own kingdom, trying the slipper on every maiden who attended the ball.
Back at Cinderella's home, love has allowed the Prince to defy the laws of time and space; though she is only awakening the morning after the ball, he has already traveled the world and back again in search of his lost love. Upon waking, Cinderella initially believes that the events of the previous night were only a dream. As she relives some of the dances of the ball, she discovers the remaining glass slipper and realizes that it was all true. At breakfast, the two stepsisters reminisce about the ball, and argue about who made the greater impression on the Prince at the ball. Their fighting is interrupted when the father and the stepmother hurry in with the news that the Prince is on his way to their house, desperately trying a glass slipper on every girl he encounters. Upon his arrival, he tries the slipper on the two stepsisters, to no avail. The stepmother, however, demands to be given a chance and tries to force her foot into the shoe, ordering Cinderella to help her. As she bends down to assist, the remaining slipper falls from her pocket and the Prince finally recognizes Cinderella for who she is. As Cinderella successfully tries on both glass slippers, her stepfamily beg for her forgiveness, which she happily bestows upon them. Overjoyed to have rediscovered each other, Cinderella and the Prince are then transported away to a secret garden by the fairy godmother, where they confess their love for one another and are happily married.

Plot outline[edit]
Ashton's Cinderella is his own realised dream of a Petipa ballet and the ballet itself enacts the realisation of dreams, notably Cinderella's own. When we first see her she is a demi-caractere dancer dreaming of being a ballerina—that seems to be the balletic point of her solo with the broomstick in the kitchen—and it is as a ballerina that she magically enters the ballroom, stepping en pointe down the stairs and advancing in pas de bourree to the front of the stage. Back in the kitchen she recalls the slipper (or rather the pointe shoe) that she carries in her apron; the shoe is the clue to her dream and persuades her it was true. The Prince finds Cinderella, but in his arms she discovers her own identity as a ballerina and her dream of herself has been realised. Cinderella's mice design the gown.

Origins[edit]
There are many versions of the story of Cinderella (the earliest was written down in China in the 9th century) and it has been the basis for a long list of pantomimes, operas, and ballets.
The earliest Cinderella ballet proper was by Duport in Vienna in 1813, although Drury Lane's Cinderella ten years earlier had a ballet divertissement of Loves and Graces introduced by Venus.
London's first complete Cinderella ballet was seen in 1822, the year Paris first heard Rossini's opera La Cenerentola.
Marius Petipa, Lev Ivanov, and Enrico Cecchetti choreographed Cinderella for the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in 1893 to the music of Baron Boris Fitinhof-Schell—it was in this splendid production that Pierina Legnani first performed in Russia her celebrated feat of 32 fouettes—but none of the choreography has survived.
Adeline Genée first danced Cinderella at the Empire, Leicester Square, on Twelfth Night 1906, and 29 years later to the day Andrée Howard choreographed her one-act Cinderella (in which Frederick Ashton was the elegant Prince) for Rambert's Ballet Club at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate.

The score[edit]
Sergei Prokofiev had begun composition on the score for Cinderella in 1941 but, because of the war and his opera War and Peace, the orchestration was not completed until 1944.
The music was choreographed first for the Bolshoi Ballet by Rostislav Zakharov in 1945 and then for the Kirov Ballet by Konstantin Sergeyev in 1946. Olga Lepeshinskaya created Cinderella in Moscow (where Ulanova, who alternated with her, had great success in the role) and Dudinskaya first danced it in Leningrad.
Prokofiev and his collaborators were guided by Perrault's version of the story and by the great Tchaikovsky ballet scores, which themselves served the structure of Petipa's choreography. Prokofiev wrote that he conceived Cinderella (which he dedicated to Tchaikovsky):

... as a classical ballet with variations, adagois, pas de deux, etc... I see Cinderella not only as a fairy-tale character but also as a real person, feeling, experiencing, and moving among us,
and again: 

What I wished to express above all in the music of Cinderella was the poetic love of Cinderella and the Prince, the birth and flowering of that love, the obstacles in its path and finally the dream fulfilled.
Ashton's choreography[edit]
Frederick Ashton first considered the idea of composing a full-evening ballet as early as 1939, when the Vic-Wells Sleeping Princess had proved so successful, but because of the war these ambitions were shelved.
Early in 1946, though, in a speech at the Soviet Theater Exhibition, de Valois said she could not wait to see the first full-length English classical ballet, and during 1946 and 1947 there were constant rumours of possible three-act ballet scores. At one point Delibes' Sylvia seemed the most likely choice (that came in 1952 and was Ashton's second full-length ballet), but in the late spring of 1948 Prokofiev's Cinderella was selected as the score Ashton would choreograph.
He had heard and liked quite a lot of the Prokofiev music and he thought Perrault's story a good one. In the event, Ashton cut some of the music, notably the third-act scene showing the Prince's journey in search of Cinderella (a pretext for a divertissement of national dances: Ashton's comment on this was ""I didn't like any of the places he went to, nor the music he wrote for them"") and a shorter dance of Grasshoppers and Dragonflies after the Fairy Summer's variation in the first act. The choreography of Cinderella is Ashton's homage to the classical tradition of Petipa, as had been Symphonic Variations of two years earlier, albeit on a smaller scale. In 1948 Ashton also created Scènes de ballet, which distilled the essence of Petipa's ballets down to just one act.
The choreography of Cinderella is full of dreams, some most definitely unfulfilled. In the ballroom, the put-upon, shy Ugly Sister—significantly Ashton's own role—performs a Petipa figure that amounts to her dream of being Odile at Siegfried's ball or the Sugar Plum Fairy. She is in fact full of choreographic dreams, and that is the clue to her character (as is the fact that she has Edith Sitwell's nose). Again in the ballroom the bossy Ugly Sister does a fish-dive with her suitor, a dream of the final pas de deux in The Sleeping Beauty.

1942 orchestral polka by Igor Stravinsky

Circus Polka: For a Young Elephant was written by Igor Stravinsky in 1942. He composed it for a ballet production that the choreographer George Balanchine did for Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus. The ballet was performed by fifty elephants and fifty ballerinas. In 1944, Stravinsky published an orchestration of the piece, which is now part of the repertoire of many orchestras.


Composition[edit]
Igor Stravinsky and George Balanchine first met in 1925, as Balanchine, who just had started working for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, choreographed the ballet version of Stravinsky's Le chant du rossignol.[1] This was the start of a long friendship and many years of collaboration, which continued after both emigrated to the United States in the 1930s.
In late 1941, the Ringling Brothers & Barnum & Bailey Circus made Balanchine the unusual proposal to do the choreography for a ballet involving the circus's famous elephant group in the spring of the following year in New York. Balanchine immediately suggested bringing in Stravinsky, much to the delight of the circus company. However, Stravinsky was only contacted by phone on January 12, 1942. Balanchine would later recount the conversation as follows:[2]

Balanchine: I wonder if you'd like to do a little ballet with me.Stravinsky: For whom?Balanchine: For some elephants.Stravinsky: How old?Balanchine: Very young.Stravinsky: All right. If they are very young elephants, I will do it.
Although Stravinsky was busy with other projects at the time, he negotiated a high fee with the Ringling Brothers & Barnum & Bailey Circus for a short instrumental, which he composed within a few days. The piano version of Circus Polka, subtitled ""For a Young Elephant"" as an allusion to the phone conversation with Balanchine, was finished on February 5, 1942.
Although the piece is, according to its name, a polka, it does contain a number of changes in rhythm. It only sounds like a polka towards the end, but this part is actually a borrowing from Franz Schubert's Marche Militaire No. 1 in D major, D. 733. Stravinsky always denied that this was a parody of the Marche Militaire.[3] He later called the whole piece a satire, the musical equivalent to Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec's drawings, but his notes do not reflect this.[4]
By the time the ballet was performed, Stravinsky was no longer involved with the project. The arrangement of the piece for an organ and a concert band was done by David Raksin. Balanchine choreographed the Circus Polka for fifty elephants and fifty human dancers, led by the cow elephant Modoc and by Balanchine's wife at the time and principal ballerina Vera Zorina respectively. The elephants, including the bulls, were decked out in pink ballet tutus. Reporters were at first concerned that Stravinsky's music might cause the elephants to panic. Balanchine was eventually able to teach Modoc the choreography.[5]
The show, advertised as a ""choreographic Tour de Force"", premiered at Madison Square Garden on 9 April 1942. The performance was successful and the crowd was particularly enthusiastic about Balanchine's extraordinary ballet.[6] After this debut, Ringling Brothers performed the ballet another forty-two times, but Stravinsky did not attend any of the shows.[7]

Versions[edit]
Two years after he composed the piano version, Stravinsky re-arranged the Circus Polka for an orchestra. This version was premiered along with Four Norwegian Moods by the Boston Symphony Orchestra in January 1944 with Stravinsky as director. During the following months a number of charity concerts to support the U.S. Army fighting in World War II were held and broadcast over the radio. Stravinsky reported that after one such broadcast he received a telegram from an elephant called Bessie who had taken part in the ballet in 1942, and whom he then met in Los Angeles.[7] After listening to another such broadcast, Charles de Gaulle ordered the sheet music for the piece and took it back home to France.[8] The orchestration soon became part of the repertoire of many orchestras and is popular to this day, especially at children's concerts.
George Balanchine re-choreographed the piece for a one-time performance by students from the School of American Ballet, which took place on 5 November 1945 at Carnegie Hall, directed by Lincoln Kirstein. After Jerome Robbins became ballet master at New York City Ballet in 1972, he created a new ballet to Stravinsky's music featuring young dance students and an adult ringmaster for their Stravinsky Festival. Since, it has become a regular piece, often with a guest ringmaster, most notably Mikhail Baryshnikov[9] and in 2008 with Robert La Fosse.[10]
In 2006, a children's book detailing the history of the Circus Polka, Leda Schubert's Ballet of the Elephants, appeared in the United States.[11]

Ballet with choreography by Mikhail Fokine

Cléopâtre  is a ballet in one act with choreography by Mikhail Fokine and music by Anton Arensky, Alexander Taneyev, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Mikhail Glinka, Alexander Glazunov, Modeste Mussorgsky, and Nikolai Tcherepnin. The scenery and costumes were created by Léon Baskt. The first production opened at Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris on June 2, 1909.[1]
The ballet starred Anna Pavlova as Ta-hor and Ida Rubinstein as Cleopatra. Mikhail Fokine himself danced Amoun. The favourite slaves of Cleopatra were danced by Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky. Other characters included Servants of the Temple, Egyptian Dancers, Greeks, Satyrs, Jewish Dancers, Syrian Musicians and Slaves.[1]
Cyril W. Beaumont writes that Cléopâtre is a largely based on a ballet called Une Nuit d'Égypte that was first produced by Fokine at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1908. The veil dance features Glinka's ""Danse Orientale"" from his opera Russlan and Ludmilla. ""Danse Persane"" from Mussogsky's Khovanchina was used as well.[1]


History[edit]
Léon Bakst’s set design for the 1909 Ballets Russes production of Cléopâtre
The first performance of Cléopâtre was staged by Fokine in Russia. The ballet was presented as Une Nuit d’Egypte, at the Mariinsky Theatre, St Petersburg on 2 March 1908. He used solely Arensky’s score for the entire show, and borrowed most of the costumes from The Pharaoh's Daughter and Aida. The soloist costumes were instead designed by Léon Bakst, and the sets, borrowed from an opera performed at the time at the Mariinsky, were retouched by Oreste Allegri. 
The ballet was later represented in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 2 June 1909 for the opening season of the Ballets Russes, produced by Serge Diaghilev. For this version, Fokine decided to cast Ida Rubinstein, one of his students, for the main role, and Alexandre Benois suggested Léon Bakst for the sets and costumes design of the entire production. 
During a tour to Latin America in 1917, the sets were destroyed in a fire. Therefore, Diaghilev ordered new sceneries to Robert Delaunay, while his wife, Sonia Delaunay, designed the costumes for the new soloists Lubov Tchernicheva and Leonide Massine. The new production opened at the London Coliseum Theatre on 5 September 1918.

Plot[edit]
Set in Egypt, the ballet tells the story of two young lovers, Ta-Hor and Amoun. They meet in the grounds of a temple, when the high priest interrupts them, announcing the arrival of the Queen Cleopatra and her court. Amoun falls in love with the Queen’s beauty, and declares his love with a message. Cleopatra accepts to spend a night with him, but in return he must drink poison the following morning. Ta-Hor tries to dissuade Amoun, but his passion is too strong. The ballet closes with Ta-Hor going back to the temple, to find the dead body of her lover.

Production[edit]
Léon Bakst, Costume of Cleopatra for Ida Rubinstein, 1909.
Cléopâtre was the most sumptuous production in the Ballets Russes’ 1909 season, due to the extraordinary design by Bakst. The dancers’ bodies gave life to his reduced costumes, that glittered like precious stones against a scenery of desert and Egyptian architecture. He used gold, lapis blue, malachite green, pink, orange and violet to embellish the characters’ costumes, jewels and weapons, imitating the motifs of what was believed to be Egyptian at the time.

Cast[edit]
For the Ballets Russes opening in 1909, the role of Cleopatra was interpreted by Ida Rubinstein. She was not a professional dancer, but her unconventional beauty and incredible sensuality strongly impressed the audience. In her first appearance in the ballet, she was carried in a mummy-case and sensually unwrapped from the many-colored veils. Amoun was played by Fokine himself, and Ta-Hor by Anna Pavlova.

Audience response[edit]
The costumes caused a sensation, since they presented several bare sections of the dancers’ bodies. The artists were instead wearing ‘fleshings’, a skin-colour silk or jersey inserts to shorten the time required for body make-up. This technique was used until 1912, but unfortunately most of these inserts didn’t survive, and don’t appear to be evident in any retouched stage photography of the time. Moreover, Cléopâtre, together with Scheherazade, started a new mania for exoticism in fashion and interior design.
This ballet was revived by Diaghilev in 1918.

Ballet created by Kenneth MacMillan

Concerto is a one-act ballet in three movements created by Kenneth MacMillan in 1966 for the Deutsche Oper Ballet. The music is Dmitri Shostakovich's Second Piano Concerto (1957). The ballet premiered on 30 November 1966.


Production[edit]
External videos Concerto - First Movement (Anna Rose O'Sullivan, James Hay; The Royal Ballet), YouTube video *Concerto – Second movement pas de deux (Marianela Nuñez , Rupert Pennefather, The Royal Ballet), YouTube video Concerto – Final movement (Kenneth MacMillan; The Royal Ballet)
, YouTube video
The ballet is plotless and consists of three movements. The first was originated by Didi Carli and Falco Kapuste. The second movement is a pas de deux originated by Lynn Seymour and Rudolf Holz, and was inspired by Seymour's warm up. MacMillan had said that he ""decided to incorporate the idea of the barre work into the choreography."" The man acts as a ""barre"" for the female dancer. The third and final movement was intended for a ""playful"" lead couple, but the male dancer broke his foot prior to the premiere, so MacMillan turned the pas de deux to a female solo, danced by Silvia Kesselheim.[1][2] The ballet also includes a corps de ballet, that dances in unison, originally 16 women and 8 men.[1][2] The original design by Jürgen Rose uses a yellow backdrop, and the costumes are in orange, russet and yellow.[3]

Other companies and revivals[edit]
Concerto was added to other companies' repertoire. The American Ballet Theatre's co-founder Lucia Chase requested to acquire the ballet immediately after watching the premiere, and the company danced it for the first time in Jacksonville, Florida in 1967, staged by Georgina Parkinson and Wendy Walker.[2][4] Frederick Ashton also sought to acquire it for Royal Ballet Touring Company (now Birmingham Royal Ballet) 
, and the company premiered it at the Royal Opera House in 1967.[1][5] The Royal Ballet debuted Concerto in 1970.[6]
In the 2017, on the 25th anniversary of MacMillan's death, five ballet companies across the UK presented a mixed bill titled Kenneth MacMillan: A National Celebration at the Royal Opera House. Concerto was performed by the Birmingham Royal Ballet, with the lead roles danced by Momoko Hirata, Tzu-Chao Chou, Jenna Roberts, Tyrone Singleton and Delia Mathews.[7]
In June 2020, in the first series of performance since the Royal Opera House's closure due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which was broadcast online, The Royal Ballet's Fumi Kaneko and Reece Clarke performed the second movement pas de deux from Concerto.[8]

Concerto Barocco is a neoclassical ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Bach's Concerto for Two Violins. Danced by a cast of eleven, the ballet is completely plotless, and according to Balanchine, ""has no ""subject matter"" beyond the score which it is danced and the particular dancers who execute it"".[1] The ballet was made for the American Ballet Caravan's 1941 South American tour, and premiered on June 27, 1941, at Teatro Municipal, Rio de Janeiro. The ballet has entered the repertories of many ballet companies, including Balanchine's New York City Ballet.


Choreography[edit]
Concerto Barocco is plotless, and is danced by two principal women, a principal man, and a corps de ballet of eight women. Each of the principal woman dances to one of the violin lines, while the corps dances to the orchestra.[2] The first and third movements featured all ten women, while the second movement is danced by a principal ballerina, the sole man and the corps.[3] One of the principal ballerinas is only absent from the stage in a few instances, while the corps is on stage for the entirety of the ballet.[2][4]: 132 

In his book Balanchine's Complete Stories of the Great Ballets, Balanchine wrote,[1]The only preparation possible for this ballet is a knowledge of its music, for Concerto Barocco has no ""subject matter"" beyond the score which it is danced and the particular dancers who execute it. Set to Bach's Concerto in D minor for Two Violins, the ballet tries to interest the audience only by its dancing, its treatment of the ballet, just as Baroque art and architecture interested people not because of their subject but because of the decorative treatment that embellished those subjects.
In the original choreography, Balanchine incorporated elements of jazz dance.[5] Ballet master John Taras described, ""Full of odd hips, odd turned-in things... All the dances have syncopation that lies under the Bach score.""[6]: 197  Suki Schorer, who had danced one of the lead roles, commented,[7] More difficult in precision in technique is exactitude in timing – the syncopation. [Balanchine] works for hours to get that right. It's as though an ounce makes all the difference. And for all its refinement, he likes it ""jazzy"". There's one place where the corps almost does the Charleston on pointe. In some of my most brisk and classical movements, he kept saying, ""Make it jazzy. Lead with the hip.""
Over the years, the choreography was altered, sometimes intentionally by Balanchine and sometimes unintentionally when other dancers took on the roles. For example, a jeté in the second movement was removed due to a dancer's bad knee.[6]: 197, 332 [8] The tempo of the ballet was also changed. Parts of the ballet were danced at a slower speed than intended, while others were faster.[8] Marie-Jeanne, the lead ballerina in the original cast, wrote in 1991, ""[Balanchine] changed Barocco musically, making it fit the beat. Today's dancers do it slower; they do two beats what we did on one beat. So it's much easier today. It doesn't have the sharpness, and it doesn't have the flow of the adagio.""[6]: 173  The jazziness in the original choreography was also gone.[6]: 197  Taras commented: ""Barocco has become rather a tepid, bland classical work now ... And now it's rather romantic, and lyrical. It became diluted.""[6]: 197 

Development[edit]
Balanchine had listened to Bach's Concerto for Two Violins for some years, often a recording by Orchestre symphonique de Paris, conductor Pierre Monteux and violinists Yehudi Menuhin and George Enescu.[5] According to Nathan Milstein, a violinist and friend of Balanchine, the choreographer was interested in Bach for ""the mathematical precision of his music and, at the same time, its pure emotional and unfeigned staining for God.""[3] In 1936, impresario Lincoln Kirstein urged Balanchine to choreograph a ballet using the concerto for Paul Draper, a tap dancer and son of his friend Muriel Draper. The project did not materialise but gave Balanchine the idea of incorporating American jazz and tap dance techniques and rhythm into the Bach score.[5] Balanchine, who was interested in jazz and African American culture, learned the counting, timing and phrasing techniques in jazz dance through his works with black dancers, including Katherine Dunham, Josephine Baker, Buddy Bradley and the Nicholas Brothers, during the 1930s.[5][9]
In spring 1941, Balanchine began choreographing Concerto Barocco as an exercise for ""stage practice"", a course Balanchine taught to advanced students at the School of American Ballet.[5] He choreographed the ballet with the Orchestre symphonique de Paris recording, but was also inspired by a syncopated arrangement of the concerto by jazz pianist Hazel Scott.[8]
Also in 1941, Kirstein was invited by his friend Nelson Rockefeller to organise a dance tour across South America subsidised by the US government. Rockefeller, who was appointed Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and given a budget to build cultural and financial relations in South America amid World War II.[4]: 128–129 [5] Kirstein said he ""was given a check which seemed so large that I was as scared as if I had stolen it.""[10] Kirstein and Balanchine then hurriedly formed the American Ballet Caravan, with dancers from their two previous troupes, American Ballet and Ballet Caravan, most of whom had trained at the School of American Ballet under Balanchine. Concerto Barocco was thus set to premiere at the South American tour.[4]: 128–129 [5] Marie-Jeanne, Mary Jane Shea and William Dollar were chosen to dance the three lead roles.[5] Balanchine's then-wife Vera Zorina was set to dance one of the lead roles, but she ultimately did not join the American Ballet Caravan.[6]: 173 
The original costumes and sets were designed by Eugene Berman, with a backdrop featuring arches and water and costumes with rubberised fabric, leaves and netting.[5] In the 1945 staging by Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo, Berman believed the sets were not properly constructed and refused to let the troupe to use his designs. Instead, the dancers were dressed in black practice clothes, an innovative move that would later become a common practice in dance.[5][2] The 1948 staging at the New York City Ballet featured the Berman designs again.[11] Beginning in 1951, the Berman designs were again dropped from the ballet and replaced by black practice clothes.[7] From 1963 onwards, the women are dressed in white leotards and skirts, and the sole man in a white shirt and black tights. The stripped-down production also features a blue cyclorama.[2]
In his will, Balanchine bequeathed American and media rights to Concerto Barocco to Kirstein.[4]: 317–318  In 1996, Marie-Jeanne took part in a videotaped session in which she coached students of the School of American Ballet to dance Concerto Barocco in its original form. Other participants of the session include former dancer and teacher Suki Schorer, dancer Merrill Ashley, ballet master John Taras and dance historian Nancy Reynolds.[8]

Performances[edit]
Concerto Barocco had a preview performance on May 29, 1941, at the Little Theater of Hunter College, New York. The ballet then officially premiered on June 27, 1941, at Teatro Municipal, Rio de Janeiro.[2] American Ballet Caravan performed in nine countries, and the tour ended in October, after which the troupe disbanded.[12]
Concerto Barocco was performed in New York in 1943 by the American Concert Ballet, a short-lived troupe consisted of Balanchine dancers, led by Dollar, Shea and Todd Bolender.[7] In 1945, Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo, where Balanchine served as resident choreographer, performed the ballet. In 1948, the ballet was performed at the first performance by the New York City Ballet, co-founded by Balanchine and Kirstein, with a cast led by Marie-Jeanne, Ruth Gilbert and Francisco Moncion.[7][11] It has remained in the company's repertory ever since.[9]
Concerto Barocco is one of Balanchine's most performed works, having entered the repertories of many ballet companies across the US and internationally.[2] By 2020, it was staged nearly 200 times.[9] Other ballet companies that had performed  the ballet include San Francisco Ballet,[6]: 456  Royal Danish Ballet,[13] National Ballet of Canada,[14] Washington Ballet,[15] Paris Opera Ballet,[4]: 228  Boston Ballet,[16] Philadelphia Ballet,[17] Ballet West,[18] Royal Winnipeg Ballet,[19] Dance Theatre of Harlem,[20] Cincinnati Ballet,[21] Los Angeles Ballet,[22] Les Grands Ballets Canadiens,[23] Birmingham Royal Ballet,[24] Pacific Northwest Ballet,[25] Atlanta Ballet,[26] Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre,[27] Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo,[28] Cape Town City Ballet,[29] and New Jersey Ballet.[30]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


August Bournonville, 1841[1]
Le Conservatoire, or A Marriage by Advertisement (Konservatoriet eller et Avisfrieri) is a two-act vaudeville ballet created by the Danish choreographer and ballet master August Bournonville in 1849 for the Royal Danish Ballet. The ballet's setting is a dance studio at the Conservatoire de Paris. Bournonville studied at the Paris Conservatoire in the 1820s with the renowned dancer Auguste Vestris. The ballet launched the career of prima ballerina Juliette Price. A divertissement within the larger work called ""The Dancing School"" (Pas d'école) permitted Bournonville to display the basics of his style and raise them to the level of enduring art.


Summary[edit]
The first act is a recreation of a Vestris dance class of the exact type attended by Bournonville during his Paris sojourn in the 1820s. In the second act, Monsieur Dufour, an inspecteur at the Conservatoire, writes a matrimonial advertisement in the newspaper but ends up marrying his housekeeper, Mademoiselle Bonjour. Typical of Bournonville’s ballets, the plot provides opportunities for introducing different dance divertissements. In the second act, for example, the pupils of the Conservatoire make a fool of Monsieur Dufour by disguising themselves as attractive women.

Music[edit]
The vaudeville genre relied on a particular musical practice that made conscious use of well-known melodies that were suitable to establish period and local color and to facilitate the audience's understanding of the extensive mime. The ballet's composer Holger Simon Paulli attempted to evoke Paris in the 1820s and 1830s. The ballet opens with Paulli's orchestrated version of Weber's concert waltz, Invitation to the Dance. Later in the score Paulli utilised Chopin's Grande valse brillante in E-flat major and Paisiello's aria Nel cor più non mi sento from the opera La Molinara. The divertissement in act 1 (Pas d'école) relies heavily on musical borrowings and the well-known pas de trois employs nearly all of Pierre Rode's Violin Concerto No.7, Op.9 from 1800, a concerto that was used as an examination piece for young violinists at the time Bournonville was living in Paris and studying with Vestris.

History[edit]
The complete two-act ballet was performed by the Royal Danish Ballet from 1849 until 1934, when it disappeared from the repertoire, perhaps because it was considered old-fashioned. In 1942, Harald Lander, the Royal Ballet director at the time, extracted ""The Dancing School"" (Pas d'école) from the larger work and staged it as a one-act divertissement.
In 1995, the Royal Danish Ballet brought the complete two-act version back into the repertoire with the help of three Bournonville experts: Kirsten Ralov, former Assistant Director and principal of the company, principal dancer Niels Bjørn Larsen, and teacher Dinna Bjørn, Larsen's daughter.
By combining personal memories of the stagings in the early 1930s, Bournonville's notations, and the writings of dancer Valborg Borchsenius regarding Harald Lander’s staging in the 1930s, the three directors made it possible to re-stage the complete Le Conservatoire.

Coppélia (sometimes subtitled: La Fille aux Yeux d'Émail (The Girl with the Enamel Eyes)[1]) is a comic ballet from 1870 originally choreographed by Arthur Saint-Léon to the music of Léo Delibes, with libretto by Charles-Louis-Étienne Nuitter. Nuitter's libretto and mise-en-scène was based upon E. T. A. Hoffmann's short story Der Sandmann (The Sandman). In Greek, κοπέλα (or κοπελιά in some dialects) means young woman. Coppélia premiered on 25 May 1870 at the Théâtre Impérial de l'Opéra, with the 16-year-old Giuseppina Bozzacchi in the principal role of Swanhilda and ballerina Eugénie Fiocre playing the part of Frantz en travesti. The costumes were designed by Paul Lormier and Alfred Albert, the scenery by Charles-Antoine Cambon (Act I, scene 1; Act II, scene 1), and Édouard Desplechin and Jean-Baptiste Lavastre (Act I, scene 2).
The ballet's first flush of success was interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War and the siege of Paris (which also led to the early death of Giuseppina Bozzacchi, on her 17th birthday), but eventually it became the most-performed ballet at the Opéra.
Modern-day productions are traditionally derived from the revivals staged by Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg in the late 19th century. Petipa's choreography was documented in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation at the turn of the 20th century. These notations were later used to stage the St. Petersburg version for such companies as the Vic-Wells Ballet (precursor of today's Royal Ballet).


Plot[edit]
Dr. Coppélius is a doctor who has made a life-size dancing doll. It is so lifelike that Franz, a village youth, becomes infatuated with it and sets aside his heart's true desire, Swanhilda. She shows him his folly by dressing as the doll, pretending to make it come to life and ultimately saving him from an untimely end at the hands of the inventor.

Act I
The story begins during a town festival to celebrate the arrival of a new bell. The town crier announces that, when it arrives, anyone who becomes married will be awarded a special gift of money. Swanhilda and Franz plan to marry during the festival. However, Swanhilda becomes unhappy with Franz because he seems to be paying more attention to a girl named Coppélia, who sits motionless on the balcony of a nearby house. The house belongs to a mysterious and faintly diabolical inventor, Doctor Coppélius. Although Coppélia spends all of her time sitting motionless and reading, Franz is mesmerized by her beauty and is determined to attract her attention. Still upset with Franz, Swanhilda shakes an ear of wheat to her head: if it rattles, then she will know that Franz loves her. Upon doing this, however, she hears nothing. When she shakes it by Franz's head, he also hears nothing; but then he tells her that it rattles. However, she does not believe him and runs away heartbroken.
Later on, Dr. Coppelius leaves his house and is heckled by a group of boys. After shooing them away, he continues on without realizing that he has dropped his keys in the melée. Swanhilda finds the keys, which gives her the idea of learning more about Coppélia. She and her friends decide to enter Dr. Coppelius' house. Meanwhile, Franz develops his own plan to meet Coppélia, climbing a ladder to her balcony.

Act II
Swanhilda and her friends find themselves in a large room filled with people. However, the occupants aren't moving. The girls discover that, rather than people, these are life-size mechanical dolls. They quickly wind them up and watch them move. Swanhilda also finds Coppélia behind a curtain and discovers that she, too, is a doll.
Dr. Coppelius returns home to find the girls. He becomes angry with them, not only for trespassing but for also disturbing his workroom. He kicks them out and begins cleaning up the mess. However, upon noticing Franz at the window, Coppélius invites him in. The inventor wants to bring Coppélia to life but, to do that, he needs a human sacrifice. With a magic spell, he will take Franz's spirit and transfer it to Coppélia. After Dr. Coppelius proffers him some wine laced with sleeping powder, Franz begins to fall asleep. The inventor then readies his magic spell.
However, Dr. Coppelius did not expel all the girls: Swanhilda is still there, hidden behind a curtain. She dresses up in Coppélia's clothes and pretends that the doll has come to life. She wakes Franz and then winds up all the mechanical dolls to aid their escape. Dr. Coppelius becomes confused and then saddened when he finds a lifeless Coppélia behind the curtain.

Act III
Swanhilda and Franz are about to make their wedding vows when the angry Dr. Coppelius appears, claiming damages. Dismayed at having caused such an upset, Swanhilda offers Dr. Coppelius her dowry in return for his forgiveness. However, Franz tells Swanhilda to keep her dowry and offers to pay Dr. Coppelius instead. At that point, the mayor intervenes and gives Dr. Coppelius a bag of money, which placates him. Swanhilda and Franz are married and the entire town celebrates by dancing.
(Note: In some Russian versions of the ballet, after getting caught, Swanhilda confesses to Dr. Coppelius about what she and her friends did and her situation with Franz. Coppelius decides to forgive Swanhilda and teach her how to act like a doll coming to life to fool Franz, thus ending Act 2 on a happier note.)

Influence and background[edit]
Doctor Coppelius is not unlike Hoffmann's sinister Herr Drosselmeyer in The Nutcracker or the macabre Svengali-like travelling magician of the same name in Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann.
The part of Franz was danced en travesti by Eugénie Fiocre, a convention that pleased the male members of the Jockey-Club de Paris and was retained in Paris until after World War II.[2]
The festive wedding-day divertissements in the village square that occupy Act III are often deleted in modern danced versions.
Some influence on this story comes from travelling shows of the late 18th and early 19th centuries starring mechanical automata.[3] This field of entertainment has been under-documented, but a recent survey of the field is contained in The Mechanical Turk by Tom Standage (2002).

Alternative versions[edit]
Opera Variant[edit]
A variation of the Coppélia story is contained in Jacques Offenbach's opera, The Tales of Hoffmann, a fictional work about the same Hoffmann who wrote the story that inspired Coppélia. The opera consists of a prologue, three fantastic tales in which Hoffmann is a participant, and an epilogue. In the first story, based on Der Sandmann, Hoffmann falls in love with a mechanical doll, Olympia, but in this case, the story has a melancholy tinge as the doll was destroyed by Dr. Coppelius, who share the same name as Coppelius who wants Coppélia to come to life, after he didn't get a check from Spalanzani for Olympia's eyes.

San Francisco Ballet[edit]
In 1939, San Francisco Ballet produced a version of Coppélia choreographed by Willam Christensen which was the first American complete version of the ballet. It starred Willam Christensen as Franz, Earl Riggins as Dr. Coppelius, and Janet Reed as Swanhilda and was an instant hit.

Balanchine[edit]
In 1974, George Balanchine choreographed a version of Coppélia for the New York City Ballet. He was assisted by Alexandra Danilova, who had performed the title role many times during her dancing career.[4] She staged the Petipa choreography for Act II. Balanchine created new choreography for Act III and for the mazurka, czardas and Franz's variation in Act I.  Patricia McBride danced the role of Swanhilda the friendliest girl; Helgi Tomasson danced the role of Franz; Shaun O'Brian portrayed Dr. Coppélius. In Act III, Balanchine added 24 young girls to dance and be in the scene during Waltz of the Hours, Dawn (L'aurore), Prayer, and Work (Le travail) variations.

Second Life - LPBA[edit]
From 2011 the Little Princess Ballet Academy (LPBA) has performed Coppélia in Second Life. The adaptation follows the original in three acts, but the mime parts are problematic to perform in Second Life and has been changed, together with some changes in the sequences. All parts are played by individual avatars.[5][6]

Monte Carlo Ballet Company - Coppel-I-A[edit]
In 2019 Jean-Christophe Maillot created a modernized version of Coppélia for the Les Ballets de Monte-Carlo, calling it Coppél-i-A.[7] In it, Coppelia is an android with artificial intelligence. The original music was rewritten by Maillot's brother Bertrand Maillot to suit the dystopian theme.[8]

Coppelia - feature film[edit]
Main article: Coppelia (2021 film)
A family feature film, Coppelia, was released in 2021, directed and written by Jeff Tudor, Steven De Beul and Ben Tesseur. The film has no dialogue and mixes live action dance with animation. It was inspired by choreographer Ted Brandsen's 2008 production created for Dutch National Ballet. In Brandsen's production, and in the film, Doctor Coppelius is updated from toymaker to cosmetic surgeon and Coppelia is a robot. The movie deals with issues such as the pressures of social media, the lure of superficial beauty and the importance of being yourself. The film stars ballerina, author and activist Michaela DePrince, Daniel Camargo, Vito Mazzeo, Darcey Bussell, Irek Mukahmedov, Sasha Mukahmedov, Jan Kooijman, Igone de Jongh and artists of Dutch National Ballet. Composer Maurizio Malagnini wrote the original score. The movie premiered at Annecy Festival 2021 and won the Golden Punt for Best Fiction Feature at the 40th Cambridge Film Festival.

Popular culture[edit]
Coppélia was featured in the Danish film Ballerina, shown in two parts in the U.S. on Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color in 1966 and later released theatrically in Europe.  Dancer Kirsten Simone played the lead.  A version is included in the revue Wake Up and Dream. It was performed by
""Coppélia's Casket"" (""Kopperia no Hitsugi""), sung by the Japanese duo Ali Project, (Arika Takarano and Katakura Mikiya) is the title of the introductory song of Japanese anime Noir, the story of two killers. ""Coppélia's Casket"" contains several references to the story of Coppélia, such as ""People are tired of dancing dolls.""
A manga (2008-2016) and anime (2013) series Coppelion is named after the dancing doll.
A movie, The Fantastic World of Dr. Coppelius / El fantástico mundo del doctor Coppelius, released on 25 December 1968, In the U.S., was titled Dr. Coppelius. The Spanish production, with the ballet company and orchestra of the Gran Teatro del Liceo of Barcelona, features Walter Slezak as Dr. Coppelius and Claudia Corday in the doll-comes-to-life role, Swanhilda / Coppelia.[9][10]
A scene from the famous ballet film The Red Shoes shows Moira Shearer playing the fictional Victoria Page. Vicky is seen as Swanhilda in the scene in which she pretends to be Coppelia, and fools even Dr. Coppelius.
The ballet Coppélia and Giuseppina Bozzacchi's tragic fate are narrated in the novel No Telling (London: Vintage, 2004) by British author Adam Thorpe (*1956).
The second season of the anime series Princess Tutu (2002-2003), makes many references to Coppélia, beginning with episode 15, ""Kapitel des Junges: Coppelia"". where one of the main characters begins trying to obtain a ""pure heart"" as a sacrifice to revive a monster Raven. The character Princess Tutu puts a stop to this by reminding the potential sacrifices that they really do not want to give up their hearts, in one instance stating that Swanhilda, though she pretended to be a doll, wanted to be able to laugh and cry as a real human with her fiancé.
The Star Trek: Picard season one finale episodes, ""Et in Arcadio Ego, Part I"" and ""Et in Arcadia Ego, Part II"" feature a planet named Coppelius, the adoptive homeworld of a group of highly evolved synthetic lifeforms akin to the lifelike dolls fashioned in Coppélia.
A family feature film, Coppelia, was released in 2021. Directed and written by Jeff Tudor, Steven De Beul and Ben Tesseur, the film mixes live action dance with animation. It was inspired by Ted Brandsen's 2008 production created for Dutch National Ballet, which updates Doctor Coppelius from toymaker to cosmetic surgeon.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


1940 Australian ballet
For the event, see Corroboree.


1950 ballet performance of John Antill's Corroboree.
Corroboree is a ballet written by Australian composer John Antill in the early 1940s. The first full version of the score was completed in 1944 and it was first performed as a concert suite in 1946.[1]   On 3 July 1950 it was performed as a ballet, at the Empire Theatre in Sydney, choreographed by Rex Reid, with dancers of the Melbourne-based National Theatre Ballet.[2]
Wildly successful and seen as a national ""coming-of-age"",[3] the ballet was performed again with new choreography by American-born dancer, choreographer and writer Beth Dean in 1954. Notably, Dean and her Australian husband, Victor Carell, had spent several months in remote outback Australia researching Aboriginal ceremonies, costumes and dance, upon which Dean's version was based.[4] In this first production, Dean danced the role of the Initiate herself.
Many of the costumes and props for this version of the ballet are held by the National Museum of Australia.[3] The music manuscript is held by the State Library of New South Wales.[5]

This article is about the ballet. For the 1939 film, see Le Corsaire (film).


Set design by Charles-Antoine Cambon for Act III, Scene 1, in the première production
Le Corsaire is a ballet typically presented in three acts, with a libretto originally created by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges loosely based on the poem The Corsair by Lord Byron. Originally choreographed by Joseph Mazilier to the music of Adolphe Adam and other composers, it was first presented by the ballet of the Théâtre Impérial de l’Opéra in Paris on 23 January 1856. All modern productions of Le Corsaire are derived from the revivals staged by the Ballet Master Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg throughout the mid to late 19th century.
The ballet has many celebrated passages which are often excerpted from the full-length work and performed independently: the scene Le Jardin animé, the Pas d’esclave,[1] the Pas de trois des odalisques, and the so-called Le Corsaire pas de deux (music mostly by Riccardo Drigo), which is among classical ballet's most famous and performed excerpts.

Synopsis[edit]
Act 1[edit]
Scene 1 – A Bazaar in a Seaport Square
Slave girls are among the goods for sale. Corsairs (pirates) arrive with their leader, Conrad. Watching the scene from a balcony is a young woman, Medora, the ward of the bazaar owner, Isaac. She fashions a coded message into a bouquet of flowers, which she throws to Conrad. Later, when Medora and Isaac go to the square, she and Conrad exchange loving glances.
At this point, Seyd Pasha, a rich buyer of slave girls, arrives in the square. Seeing Medora, he is smitten and asks to buy her. Isaac initially refuses, but as Seyd Pasha raises his price Isaac eventually relents. Seyd Pasha orders that Medora be delivered to his palace and leaves. Conrad promises Medora that he and his corsairs will rescue her. The corsairs begin to dance with the slave girls. At a signal from Conrad the corsairs all run off with the girls. For good measure, they also kidnap Isaac.
Scene 2 – The Corsair's Den
Medora asks Conrad to release the women slaves. To this he agrees. However, one of his men – Birbanto – objects and begins a fight. Conrad subdues him. Meanwhile, Isaac tries to escape. The corsairs who are opposed to Conrad's release of the women convince Isaac to stay long enough to give Conrad a flower sprayed with a sleeping potion.
Later, at dinner, Medora dances for Conrad. Isaac gives to her the flower with the sleeping potion, asking that she give it to Conrad. She does this, and when he smells the flower he falls asleep. Corsairs surround Medora, threatening her. Defensively, she stabs Birbanto in the arm and faints into the arms of the corsairs, who take her away. Conrad awakens and sets out to recapture Medora.

Act 2[edit]
Scene 3 – Harem at the Palace of Seyd Pasha
The Sultana Zulina demands that the Odalisques (female concubines of the harem) respect her. For this, she is mocked by harem slave Gulnara and her friends. Seyd Pasha enters. Gulnara teases him flirtatiously in dance, and he gives her a handkerchief. She makes fun of him by passing the handkerchief around the group of women. Seyd Pasha is furious. His Keeper of the Harem attempts to distract and calm him with dancing performances by the girls. Isaac arrives, leading Medora in delivery of her sale to Seyd Pasha. She begs Seyd Pasha for her freedom and also complains of mistreatment by Isaac. Gulnara comforts her. Seyd Pasha offers Medora jewels, which she refuses. The Corsairs enter, disguised as robed members of a religious order. They act embarrassed at the sight of the concubines of the harem. Seyd Pasha orders the women of the harem to dance for the entertainment of his guests.
Conrad, in his disguise, recognizes Medora. The corsairs throw off their disguises and threaten Seyd Pasha with daggers. The Corsairs begin pillaging the palace. Gulnara rushes in, pursued by Birbanto. Medora recognizes Birbanto as her kidnapper and informs Conrad. She demonstrates the identification by pointing out the wound she inflicted on Birbanto's arm. Medora prevents Conrad from killing Birbanto, who then runs away. Seyd Pasha's guards enter and attack the corsairs, capturing them including Conrad. Seyd Pasha sentences Conrad to death.

Act 3[edit]
Scene 4 – Seyd Pasha's Private Room at the Palace
Seyd Pasha proposes to Medora, who refuses him. As Conrad is led to his execution, Medora begs Seyd Pasha to pardon him. He agrees on the condition that she freely submit to him. He leaves the room as she considers the offer. Conrad is able to run to her; she informs him of the deal she must make to have him freed. Conrad objects and talks her out of the offer. They resolve to die together. At this point Gulnara, who is in love with Seyd Pasha, approaches the two and proposes a plan to secretly switch places with Medora in the wedding.
Seyd Pasha returns to the room where after assurances from Medora he orders Conrad to be freed and the marriage ceremony to commence. Later, as the wedding procession approaches, the bride enters covered in a veil. Seyd Pasha places a ring on the bride's finger in marriage, and the odalisques dance.
After the wedding, Seyd Pasha is alone with Medora. As she dances for him, she tells him that the pistol on his belt scares her and asks that he give it to her. He complies. She then asks for his dagger, and he hands that over also. She continues to dance to evade him. As he kneels before her and begs for her love, he hands her his handkerchief. Acting as if playfully joking, she ties his hands with the handkerchief.
At this point Conrad enters the room. He and Medora threaten Seyd Pasha, warning him not to raise a cry of alarm. They escape. Gulnara rushes into the room and unties Seyd Pasha. She shows him the ring on her finger and reveals it was she that he had married.
Scene 5 – Corsair Ship at Sea
At first the sea is calm. Birbanto is in chains. On Medora's pleas, Conrad releases him. As a storm arises, Birbanto tries to sow dissatisfaction among the crew. Conrad throws him overboard. The ship runs aground. The sea calms. Conrad and Medora are seen climbing safely on to land together.[2]

Origins[edit]
Variation of Le Corsaire at the Prix de Lausanne 2010.Le Corsaire was created primarily for the talents of the famous Italian ballerina Carolina Rosati, who was then the Opéra's reigning Prima ballerina. The role of Conrad—which contained no dancing in Mazilier's original staging—was created by the Italian Domenico Segarelli. Although he was an accomplished dancer, it was Segarelli's abilities as a mime artist that won him the many roles he created on the stage of the Opéra. It would not be until many years later that the role of Conrad included any dancing.
Le Corsaire in Russia[edit]
The first production[edit]
Le Corsaire was first staged in Russia for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg by Jules Perrot, who served as Premier Maître de Ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres from 1849 until 1858. Le Corsaire was performed for the first time on 24 January [O.S. 12 January] 1858 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, with the Prima ballerina Ekaterina Friedbürg as the heroine Medora, and the young Marius Petipa as the corsair Conrad. For this production Petipa assisted Perrot in rehearsals, and even revised a few of the ballet's key dances.

Marius Petipa's revivals[edit]

Over the course of his long career Petipa presented four revivals of Le Corsaire, each time adding a substantial number of new pas, variations and incidental dances. His first revival was staged especially for his wife, the Prima Ballerina Maria Surovshchikova-Petipa, with the Premier danseur Christian Johansson as Conrad. The production premiered on 5 February [O.S. 24 January] 1863, and included a score supplemented and revised by the composer Cesare Pugni. For this revival, Petipa also extracted a pas de deux, the Pas d'esclave, from Duke Peter Oldenbourg's score to Petipa's ballet La Rose, la violette et le papillon.[3]
Four years later Joseph Mazilier came out of retirement to mount a revival of Le Corsaire in honor of the 1867 Exposition Universelle, given that year in Paris. The celebrated German ballerina Adèle Grantzow performed the role of Medora, while Adolphe Adam's former pupil Léo Delibes composed new music for a Pas des fleurs especially for Grantzow. The revival premiered on 21 October 1867 and was given thirty-eight performances with Grantzow as the heroine Medora. After the ballerina's departure from Paris in 1868, Le Corsaire was removed from the Opéra's repertory, never to be performed by the Parisian ballet again.
In the winter of 1867, Granztow was invited to perform with the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg by Emperor Alexander II. For her début, Petipa staged a revival of Le Corsaire, which was given for the first time on 6 February [O.S. 25 January] 1868. For the production Petipa again called upon Cesare Pugni to compose music for new dances.
Petipa's third revival of Le Corsaire was staged especially for the Russian Ballerina Eugeniia Sokolova, given for the first time on 22 November [O.S. 10 November] 1880.
Petipa's final and most important revival of Le Corsaire premiered on 25 January [O.S. 13 January] 1899, at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. This production was mounted especially for the benefit performance of Pierina Legnani, Prima ballerina assoluta of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The Prima ballerina Olga Preobrajenskaya performed the role of Gulnare, and the Imperial Theatre's Premier danseur Pavel Gerdt performed the role of Conrad.

Moscow productions of Le Corsaire[edit]
In March 1858 Marius Petipa was dispatched to mount Jules Perrot's version of Le Corsaire for the Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre (today known as the Bolshoi Ballet), who continued performing the ballet with some regularity for many years in various revivals. In 1888 Petipa supervised the creation of a new production of Le Corsaire for the company, which premiered to a resounding success. Petipa was a leading choreographer of the time in Russia. In 1894 the Bolshoi Theatre's newly appointed Ballet Master Ivan Clustine mounted his staging of Le Corsaire, which premiered on 22 March [O.S. 9 March] 1894. Petipa would later allege that Clustine's production apparently plagiarised much of his own choreography, particularly for the scene Le jardin animé.

Ekaterina Geltzer as Medora in Alexander Gorsky's production of Le Corsaire. Moscow, 1912
On 25 January  [O.S. 12 January] 1912 Alexander Gorsky, Premier Maître de Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre, presented his revival of Le Corsaire, with Ekaterina Geltzer as Medora and Vasily Tikhomirov as Conrad. For this revival Gorsky supervised a substantially revised edition of Adam's score that included a myriad of new dances. The airs of such composers as Edvard Grieg, Anton Simon, Reinhold Glière, Karl Goldmark, Frédéric Chopin, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Antonín Dvořák were fashioned into dansante accompaniment for new scenes, pas, variations, and the like. Among the most notable scenes added by Gorsky was a dream sequence set to a Nocturne by Chopin, in which the character Medora dreams of her beloved Conrad. Another interpolation of note was a divertissement for Turkish, Persian and Arabian slave-women that took place during the scene in the bazaar of the first act. Even with the production's large number of interpolated pieces, Gorsky chose to retain many of the additional pas as included in the ballet by Mazilier and Petipa.
Gorsky's revival of Le Corsaire remained in the repertory of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre until 1927. Although the company regularly performed extracts from Le Corsaire for many years thereafter, the full-length work was not given again until Konstantin Sergeyev staged his version for the company in 1992.

The Bolshoi Ballet's revival of 2007[edit]
On 21 June 2007 the Bolshoi Ballet presented a lavish revival of Le Corsaire staged by Yuri Burlaka and the company's director Alexei Ratmansky. Burlaka utilized the choreographic notation of the Sergeyev Collection, as well as materials found in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, the Bakhrushin Theater Museum and the St. Petersburg State Museum of Theatre and Music to assist in mounting a historically informed production. This version of Le Corsaire proved to be the most expensive production of a ballet ever mounted, estimated at $1.5 million USD.

Le Corsaire in Leningrad and the West[edit]
Petipa's 1899 revival of Le Corsaire, which was given its final production in 1915, remained in the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre until 1928 (after the 1917 Russian Revolution the ballet company was known as the State Petrograd Ballet, and later the State Academic Ballet, before it was renamed the Kirov Ballet). By 1928 Le Corsaire had been performed 224 times since 1899 at the Mariinsky Theatre.
Agrippina Vaganova, the revered pedagogue of Russian Ballet, supervised the first noted post-revolution revival of Le Corsaire for the Kirov Ballet, first performed on 15 May 1931 (Mikhail Dudko as Conrad). In 1936 another revival of Le Corsaire was given by the Kirov Ballet, with Natalia Dudinskaya as Medora, Mikhail Mikhailov as Conrad, and Vakhtang Chabukiani as the Slave (or Rhab, as the character was known in Russia). This was the first production of the full-length work to include Vaganova's 1931 revision of Le Corsaire pas de deux as staged for Dudinskaya's graduation performance. Over time, Konstantin Sergeyev, artistic director and chief choreographer of the Kirov Ballet from 1951 to 1955 and 1960–1970, added various new pieces. From 1941 the production was only given on rare occasions until it was totally removed from the repertory in 1956.

Pyotr Gusev’s revival of 1955[edit]
The ballet master Pyotr Gusev staged a new version of Le Corsaire for the Maly Theatre Ballet of Leningrad in 1955. This production used a modified version of the original libretto, written by Gusev and the ballet historian Yuri Slonimsky.
Gusev called upon the conductor Eugene Kornblit to fashion a new score for his production. Although the ballet master retained the traditional interpolations as handed down from Petipa's Imperial-era productions, he discarded nearly all of Adam's original 1856 score in favor of music fashioned from passages lifted from Adam's 1840 ballet L′Écumeur de mer (The Pirate) and his 1852 opera Si j’étais roi. With this new music, leitmotifs were created for the ballet's main characters.
A new character was also included—known as the slave Ali—a role which evolved out of the Slave who took part in Le Corsaire pas de deux in early Soviet productions of the full-length work at the Mariinsky Theatre.

Gusev's revival premiered on 31 May 1955, and went on to become the most popular version of Le Corsaire in Russia. In 1977 the director of the Kirov Ballet, Oleg Vinogradov, staged Gusev's version for the company, who still retain the production in their repertory. The Novosibirsk Ballet also includes Gusev's version in their repertory. In 2009 the Mikhailovsky Theatre Ballet staged Gusev's version as revised by artistic director of ballet Farouk Ruzimatov.
The Kirov Ballet's staging of Gusev's version of Le Corsaire was given a new production in 1989 for the company's engagement at New York's Metropolitan Opera House. A performance of the new production was filmed that same year at the Mariinsky Theatre with the ballerina Altynai Asylmuratova as Medora, Yevgeny Neff as Conrad, Konstantin Zaklinsky as Isaac Lankendem, Yelena Pankova as Gulnare, and Farouk Ruzimatov as Ali. This film has been released onto DVD/video.

Konstantin Sergeyev's revival of 1973[edit]
In 1973, the ballet master of the Kirov Ballet, Konstantin Sergeyev, staged his own version of Le Corsaire that included new pieces and updated choreography. Sergeyev included a new variation for the characters Conrad and Birbanto in Act I, fashioned from themes taken from Adam's original score.
Sergeyev's revival was pulled from the Kirov Ballet's repertory after only nine performances. It has been said that the Ballet Master had fallen into disfavor with the Soviet government due to the defections from the U.S.S.R. of Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, Makarova's defection having caused his dismissal from the post of artistic director in 1970.
The full-length Le Corsaire was not performed again by the Kirov Ballet until 1977, when Oleg Vinogradov (the Kirov Ballet's artistic director from 1977) staged Pyotr Gusev's 1955 version. In 1989 the Kirov Ballet decided to present a revival of Le Corsaire for its upcoming world tour. There was much debate as to whether Vinogradov's staging of Gusev's version would be retained or whether Sergeyev's version would be reinstated. In the end the company chose to retain the Gusev version, which the company still performs regularly.
In 1992 Yuri Grigorovich, director of the Bolshoi Ballet of Moscow, invited Sergeyev to mount his 1973 revival of Le Corsaire for the company. This production—which included a heavily re-edited and re-orchestrated score by the Bolshoi Theatre's conductor Alexander Sotnikov—premiered on 11 March 1992 to great success, but after only seven performances Grigorovich decided to pull the production from the repertory. After witnessing the success of Sergeyev's production, Grigorovich decided to stage his own version, which premiered on 16 February 1994. Grigorovich's production was then taken out of the repertory after the director left the company in 1995.

Sergeyev's version is staged in the United States[edit]
The sets and costumes designed by Irina Tibilova for Konstantin Sergeyev's 1992 Moscow production sat unused in the archives of the Bolshoi Theatre for almost five years. At the suggestion of Sergeyev's wife, Natalia Dudinskaya, Anna-Marie Holmes staged Sergeyev's 1992 production for the Boston Ballet (with the assistance of Dudinskaya, Tatiana Terekhova, Sergei Berezhnoi, Tatiana Legat, and Vadim Disnitsky).
Nearly one year later, American Ballet Theatre rented and ultimately bought the Boston Ballet's production of Le Corsaire. The staging went through even more revisions both choreographically and musically, with modifications performed by American Ballet Theatre conductor Charles Barker and the company pianist Henrietta Stern. A run of performances at the Orange County Performing Arts Center resulted in the release of a DVD.

Bavarian State Ballet's revival of Le Corsaire[edit]
On 26 January 2006, the Bayerisches Staatsballett (Bavarian State Ballet) presented a partial reconstruction of Petipa's 1899 revival of Le Corsaire with additional choreography by Ivan Liska. For this production, twenty-five of Petipa's original dances were reconstructed from the Stepanov Choreographic Notation of the Sergeyev Collection by Doug Fullington. Modifications of the music-score by Maria Babanina. Set and costumes: Roger Kirk.

The Bolshoi Ballet's revival of 2007[edit]
On 21 June 2007 the Bolshoi Ballet presented a lavish revival of Petipa's Le Corsaire staged by Alexei Ratmansky with new choreography, which included some reconstructed elements of Petipa's dances as staged for his 1899 revival reconstructed from the choreographic notation of the Sergeyev Collection by Yuri Burlaka (also responsible for the music dramaturgy conception). Set: Boris Kaminsky, Costumes: Elena Zaitseva.

English National Ballet 2013[edit]
The English National Ballet became the first British ballet company to perform Le Corsaire as a complete work, in a production staged by Anna-Marie Holmes, completely re-imagined with original designs and costumes, plus a reworked score and new orchestrations. The production toured the UK visiting theatres in Milton Keynes, Southampton, Oxford, Bristol and Manchester, including a London season at the London Coliseum and was filmed for digital distribution by Digital Theatre. ENB had performed in Royal Opera House Muscat, Oman on 10,11,12 March 2016. The outreach team had given an excellent pre performance talk which made good understanding for the multi cultural spectators

Ballet by Christopher Wheeldon


Corybantic GamesChoreographerChristopher WheeldonMusicLeonard BernsteinPremiere15 March 2018 (2018-03-15)Royal Opera HouseOriginal ballet companyThe Royal BalletDesignErdem MoralıoğluJean-Marc Puissant
Corybantic Games is a ballet choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon to Bernstein's Serenade after Plato's ""Symposium"", with costumes designed by Erdem Moralıoğlu and sets designed by Jean-Marc Puissant. It premiered on 15 March 2018 at the Royal Opera House, danced by The Royal Ballet.[1][2]


Production[edit]
Christopher Wheeldon had previously choreographed to Bernstein's Serenade after Plato's ""Symposium"" in a piece titled Corybantic Ecstasies, created for the Boston Ballet and premiered in 1999.[3]
The 2018 Corybantic Games was commissioned for Bernstein's centennial. The title is a reference to Corybants, which according to Greek mythology, were the armed and crested dancers who worshipped the Phrygian goddess Cybele with drumming and dancing.[4][5] The ballet made no reference to Plato's Symposium, the inspiration of Bernstein's score.[2] It is performed by 21 dancers.[4]
The set was designed by Jean-Marc Puissant[6][7] and the lighting was designed by Peter Mumford.[2] Erdem Moralıoğlu, known for his own label, ERDEM, was brought in to design the costume. Moralıoğlu met Wheeldon at one of his fashion shows,[1] and the two were introduced to each other through principal dancer Lauren Cuthbertson, a friend of Moralıoğlu.[8] Moralıoğlu himself had seen several Royal Ballet performances, including Wheeldon's After the Rain and The Winter's Tale.[1] He said the costumes of Corybantic Games are about ""flesh, and youth, and life"". It was also the first time he designed for men.[8] Due to Moralıoğlu's involvement, the publicity regarding the ballet before its premiere was mainly about the costumes.[4]

Ballet by Ludwig van Beethoven
The Creatures of Prometheus (German: Die Geschöpfe des Prometheus), Op. 43, is a ballet composed in 1801 by Ludwig van Beethoven following the libretto of Salvatore Viganò. The ballet premiered on 28 March 1801 at the Burgtheater in Vienna and was given 28 performances. It was premiered in New York at the Park Theatre on 14 June 1808 being one of the first full length works by Beethoven to be performed in the United States. It is the only full length ballet by Beethoven.

History[edit]
Viganò was tasked with presenting a work to the Archduchess Maria Theresa at the Vienna Court Theatre (Burgtheater), and chose the subject matter of Prometheus in an allegorical sense. While Viganò usually composed his own music for his performances, he felt this performance was far too important and asked Beethoven to compose instead.[1] The ballet was written in two acts, with Beethoven creating an overture, an introduction, fifteen numbers, and a finale.

Summary[edit]
The ballet is an allegory based on the mythical story of Prometheus, who stole fire from Zeus in order to create mankind from clay. In the ballet, Prometheus finds mankind in a state of ignorance and decides to introduce the ideas of science and art to them, largely based on Beethoven's own support of the Enlightenment movement. Prometheus introduces the humans to Apollo, the god of the arts, who commands Amphion, Arion and Orpheus to teach music, and Melpomene and Thalia to teach tragedy and comedy. The humans also meet with Terpsichore who, along with Pan, introduces them to the Pastoral Dance, followed by Dionysus introducing his Heroic Dance.[2]
In 1930, musicologist Jean Chantavoine and playwright Maurice Léna made a detailed reconstruction of the plot in relation to the music, based on sources that have stood the test of time.[3] A summary of this reconstruction is given below.

Music and reconstruction of the plot[edit]
Overture
Act 1 opens with an introduction, followed by three numbers.[4]

Introduction – Humanity is represented as two still lifeless statues at the Olympus (originally played by Maria Casentini and Salvatore Viganò, who also created the choreography). Zeus tries to stop Prometheus giving the fire to the people through a fierce storm. Yet Prometheus succeeds. He collapses in exhaustion.Poco adagio – The two statues come to life (first the man and then the woman). Without further life experience, the two dance around carefree, to the annoyance of Prometheus.Adagio – allegro con brio – Prometheus is angry at the unmannerliness of the two statues and he considers destroying humanity. But heaven intervenes. A divine light makes him change his mind.Minuetto – Prometheus now plans to educate the people by taking them to the Parnassus. In this minuet he introduces them with flowers and fruit respectively. At the end the trio heads away, towards the Parnassus. Curtain.
Act 2 includes another 13 numbers:

Maestoso – Andante – The gods, led by Apollo, have taken place on a temple on the Parnassus. Prometheus arrives with the two humans and explains that they need to be educated so that they develop minds and emotions. The lessons begin.Adagio – Andante quasi allegretto – Their feelings are aroused by harp playing of Amphion, flute playing of Euterpe (some sources mention Arion) and cello playing of Orpheus. The man and woman fall in love with each other.Un poco adagio – Allegro – Joyful dance of the two humans, for whom a world has opened.Grave – The humans show respect for Prometheus and Apollo. The lesson continues.Allegro con brio – Presto – By the god Mars they are taught the martial art by means of an impressive procession.Adagio – Allegro molto – But then death comes in the form of Melpomene. Since Prometheus was the bringer of not only life, but with it death, she considers it righteous to punish him with death. He is overthrown. A long hiatus. In the dark, Prometheus appears to be dead.Pastorale – Thaleia makes death recoil by summoning youth and nature to oppose it. Prometheus awakes and watches the scene.Andante – At a sign of Dionysus, Silenus enters.Maestoso (also known as ""Solo di Gioia"" for solo dancer Gaetano Gioia) – Procession of Silenus (some sources name Dionysus). Danse comique that revolves around wine.Allegro – Comodo – Dance of Pan and two fauns or nymphs.Andante – Adagio (also known as ""Solo della Casentini"", written for Beethoven's prima ballerina, Maria Casentini) – The three graces continue to work on the emotional development of the woman. Solo of the prima ballerina. Cupids arrive. The wedding is being prepared.Andantino – Adagio (also known as ""Solo di Viganò"") – The man is brought before Apollo. Solo of the primo ballerino and duet.Finale – Wedding where different groups enter, pay tribute to the gods and celebrate the success of Prometheus' mission.
According to musicologist Lewis Lockwood, Beethoven's music for this ballet is ""easier and lighter than music for the concert hall ... [I]t shows Beethoven exploiting instruments and coloristic orchestral effects that would never appear in his symphonies or serious dramatic overtures.""[5] Beethoven later based the fourth movement of his Eroica symphony and his Eroica Variations (piano) on the main theme of the last movement (Finale) of this ballet.[5]
The ballet requires the use of harp and basset horn among the orchestral instruments, instruments Beethoven rarely employed.[6]

Creole Giselle is a version of the ballet Giselle in which the story's events are moved to 1840s Louisiana and given an Afro-Creole focus.


Background[edit]
For centuries classical ballet has been seen as an elitist art form and has rarely been identified as a form of dance ordinarily performed by African Americans or other minorities. In 1984, Frederic Franklin restaged the traditional European Giselle for the Dance Theatre of Harlem. To many, this restaging was seen as inappropriate and inferior to those based on the 1841 original choreographers, Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot.[1] To others, Creole Giselle was a ground-breaking achievement.

Dance Theatre of Harlem and Arthur Mitchell[edit]
The Dance Theatre of Harlem was founded by Arthur Mitchell and Karel Shook in 1969, shortly after the death of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Arthur Mitchell was the first African-American soloist for the New York City Ballet. In 1955, he was chosen by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein to join the company. Mitchell's career boomed during the pre-civil rights era and set the precedent for African Americans in concert dance, specifically classical ballet. Mitchell and Shook were influenced by the “optimism and idealism of the Civil Rights Era” when they founded the school in the community where Mitchell spent his adolescent years, Harlem, New York.[2] Mitchell's plan was to give underprivileged children the same opportunities that he had as a teenager. The mission statement of the company is to “present a ballet company of African-American and other racially diverse artists who perform the most demanding repertory at the highest level of quality.”[3] This statement stays true to what Mitchell has done throughout the years, either through touring the company or community outreach.

Frederic Franklin[edit]
Frederic Franklin was born in Liverpool, England, in 1914 and at the age of six his mother took him to his first dance class.[4] From an early age, Franklin was noticed for his innate capacity for remembering dance steps. When Franklin moved to Paris, he dabbled in cabaret and then moved to London to continue performing in numerous cabarets and vaudeville with the Vic-Wells Ballet, now known as the Royal Ballet. In 1935, Franklin joined the Markova-Dolin Ballet, and it was through his dancing with this company that he was seen and asked by Léonide Massine to join the new Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. Franklin signed a four-year contract with the company, which proved to be the most significant opportunity in his career. In 1952, he founded the Slavenska/Franklin Ballet with Mia Slavenska.[5] After touring Japan and the Philippines, the company folded due to management and financial problems. He returned to the Ballet Russe shortly afterwards and restaged the repertory that had been lost when Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo folded. Through his work with The George Balanchine Foundation, he became the artistic advisor of the Dance Theatre of Harlem.

Traditional staging of Giselle[edit]
The award-winning ballet Giselle was set in the Rhineland of the Middle Ages during the grape harvest. Giselle, a peasant girl, falls in love with her neighbor Loys, the man whom Count Albrecht disguises himself as. A forester, Hilarion, loves Giselle, but she pays him no mind. During Giselle's celebration of the end of the grape harvest, Hilarion discovers Loy's real identity. The Duke of Courland and his daughter, Bathilde, Albrecht's future wife, arrive and are welcomed by the peasants. Hilarion tells Giselle the truth about Loys, just as she is being crowned Queen of the Village. In shock, Giselle tries to kill herself with Albrecht's sword, but dies from a weak heart. The Wilis are the ghosts of young girls who die before their wedding day, and who avenge themselves by making men who come to their graveyard dance themselves to death. One night, Hilarion visits Giselle's grave and the Wilis kill him. Albrecht brings lilies to Giselle's grave and she appears to him. As the Wilis attempt to kill Albrecht, Giselle asks Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, to save him. Albrecht is spared, but Giselle must return to her grave.

Reconstruction of Giselle[edit]
The adaptation by the Dance Theatre of Harlem (DTH) of this traditional version of Giselle is very similar to the original, except for a few changes in the storyline and variations in the choreography. The narrative, the choreography, and the music by French composer Adolphe Charles Adam are kept the same as the original Giselle.
The ballet is also set in Louisiana during the 1840s, and consists of an all-African American cast. The dancers wear costumes similar to the daily dress of African Americans in the 1840s. During this time social status among freed blacks was measured by how far removed one's family was from slavery. Giselle's character is kept the same; her greatest joy is to dance. Albrecht is now Albert and the Wilis are the ghosts of young girls who adore dancing and die of a broken heart.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Cydalise et le chèvre-pied (""Cydalise and the goat-foot"" or ""Cydalise and the satyr"") is a two-act ballet originally choreographed by Léo Staats to a score by Gabriel Pierné. The libretto was written by Gaston Arman de Caillavet and Robert de Flers, based on Remy de Gourmont's Lettre d'un satyre. Though it was composed between 1914 and 14 February 1915, its Paris Opera premiere was delayed due to the conditions of World War I until 15 January 1923.[1] The use of the French term ""chèvre-pied"" (goat foot) to refer to the satyr is distinct to this composition.
The ballet remains one of the Pierné's most popular compositions. The music is of the impressionist era, though it contains elements of Romanticism, Neoclassicism, and Neo-Baroque music.[2]  Three years after the premiere Pierné extracted two suites from the work, the first of which includes sections from the first two tableaux while the second comprises the entire third tableau. One of the most recognizable pieces in the ballet, ""L'École des Ægipans,"" also known as ""The Entry of the Little Fauns"" or ""The March of the Fauns,"" is occasionally excerpted and performed separately.[2]

Style and influences[edit]
Cydalise et le Chèvre-pied makes use of modes and lush harmonies characteristic of impressionist music.  The opening moonrise scene, highlighted by a wordless chorus, uses techniques similar to that of Maurice Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé (1912).  Cydalise, however, differs in its adherence to shorter musical numbers and closed form composition. The ballet also references styles customary to the Classical and Baroque musical eras, employing a magnified woodwind section emphasizing flutes and piccolos, and even a contemporaneously uncommon use of the harpsichord in Act II.[1]

Discography[edit]
1976: Orchestra suites no. 1 and 2 (+ Ramuntcho), performed by the Paris Opera,  Jean-Baptiste Mari (dir.) - EMI Classics.
2001: Cydalise et le Chèvre-pied, performed by the Luxembourg Philharmonic Orchestra, David Shallon (dir.) - Timpani Records.[3]
In popular culture[edit]
Cydalise et le Chèvre-pied was among Toccata and Fugue in D minor, Nutcracker Suite, Night on Bald Mountain, Ave Maria, Dance of the Hours, Clair de Lune, The Rite of Spring, and The Sorcerer's Apprentice as the original planned line-up for Walt Disney's Fantasia (1940).  However, both it and Clair de Lune were removed from the program late in the writing process and Cydalise et le Chèvre-pied was ultimately replaced with sections from Ludwig van Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony.[4]

Ballet composed by Charles Lecocq
For the Swan from The Carnival of the Animals, see Le Cygne.
Cover of piano score, 1899
Le Cygne is a one-act ballet, with choreography by Mariquita, a scenario by Catulle Mendès, and music by Charles Lecocq. It was first staged at the Opéra-Comique, Paris on 20 April 1899. It is loosely based on the classical myth of Leda and the Swan.

Synopsis[edit]
Dehelly as Leda
Pierrot has happened across Leda bathing in the river Eurotas. He falls in love with her, and returns at dawn the next day hoping to catch sight of her again. A little faun, seeing the boy's sadness, offers him wine, fruits, and flowers, and summons nymphs and dryads from the adjoining laurel grove. They dance round him while he plays on a pipe, but he remains inconsolable. When music is heard in the distance announcing the arrival of Leda, with her attendants, he drives away the nymphs, dryads, and faun, and conceals himself among the flowers. Leda prepares for her morning bath, expressing the hope that she will again meet the beautiful swan – Zeus in disguise – who often meets her at this spot. She and her women undress and plunge into the river; the swan appears, gliding towards Leda. The attendants raise their cloaks to hide from view the embrace with which the queen welcomes the bird; but Pierrot has seen all, and, furious with jealousy, he strikes the swan with his stick, inflicting a mortal wound, from which the bird soon dies, singing before he expires.[2]
Struck with remorse, Pierrot runs to hide himself in the laurel grove, but Leda wounds him with an arrow. She then orders her attendants to place the swan on a litter of branches and flowers; the funeral procession moves off, leaving Pierrot alone, weeping despairingly. The faun returns and advises him to impersonate the swan. He is white like his dead rival, and his wide sleeves resemble wings. If the moon goddess Selene would only bring on a momentary eclipse of the sun the deception could be easily carried out. The sky darkens; Leda and her women return, and are astonished when another swan comes gliding on the river towards the queen. Night comes on suddenly, but soon daylight returns, and in a final apotheosis there appear huge eggs, from which hatch three little Pierrots with swans' wings on their backs.[2]

Critical reception[edit]
The reviewer for The Era found the story ingenious, but too sexually explicit for the respectable audiences of the Opéra-Comique. He thought Lecocq's music ""tuneful enough, but commonplace, jingling—by no means in harmony with M. Mendes' light, poetical, fantastic theme"". The choreography and staging were praised.[2]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet composed by American composer Aaron Copland
Dance Panels is a ballet composed by Aaron Copland in 1959 for a planned collaboration with choreographer Jerome Robbins. After Copland had written the score, Robbins reneged on his commitment and the performance did not take place. Three years later, Copland revised the score for a ballet by the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, Germany, where it premiered on 3 December 1963. The ballet was performed by the New York City Ballet in 1965 and the concert version received its first performance at the Ojai Music Festival the following year. According to Copland biographer Howard Pollack, Dance Panels has proven from a musical standpoint one of the composer's more accessible late scores. While some of its more dissonant moments sound similar to Copland's twelve-tone compositions, other parts recall his earlier stage and screen music. It is also the only one of Copland's six ballets not written to a specific program.


Background[edit]
Aaron Copland wrote Dance Panels in 1959 on a commission from Jerome Robbins and his ""Ballets: U.S.A."" company.[1] This company was sponsored through the American National Theatre and Academy (ANTA), a United States government agency set up to represent American art abroad.[2] According to Pollack, Robbins had wanted to work with Copland on a ballet since 1944, following his Broadway success with Leonard Bernstein's ballet Fancy Free, and had a proposed a similar scenario to Copland at that time.[1]  In Copland Since 1943, the composer dates their desire to collaborate on a ballet at 1954, when Robbins directed the premiere of his opera The Tender Land at the New York City Opera.[3] At the beginning of 1959, Robbins suggested two options to Copland, a ballet based on The Dybbuk and a non-programmatic ballet. Copland opted for the latter.[1] Robbins then volunteered an outline that he tentatively called Theatre Waltzes:

The originating idea is to do a ballet with presents the style, youth, technical competence, theatrical qualities and personalities of the company [Ballets: U.S.A.] in pure dance terms. The technique is essentially classic ballet (in the way that Americans employ it) and to make the whole ballet a declarative statement—open, positive, inventive, joyous (rather than introspective)—a parade; a presentation; perhaps elegant, witty, tender and with a sure technique.
The ballet should be a chamber work in effect, both on stage as well as in the pit: the form, number of people and the quality of the atmosphere intimate and clear. It should say, this is Dance; it's the way we use our European heritage (classic technique) in America.[4]
At the top of his proposal to Copland, Robbins wrote, ""These are only ideas,""[5] Pollack writes that the choreographer ""went on to suggest over twenty different types of waltzes, including 'circus waltz' and 'tea-room waltz'; at the same time, he recognizes the advantages of working with 'more abstract and evocative' forms.""[6]
Copland finished the ballet in early 1959, in the hope the work would be premiered at that year's Spoleto Festival in Florence, Italy.[6] However, Robbins, to the dismay of ANTA, decided not to stage Dance Panels.[5] While the choreographer claimed at the time that he did not receive the full score until the day before the troupe was to leave for Italy, both he and the composer had found the music had not turned out as either person had anticipated.[5] Robbins later wrote that the score was ""much more serious and difficult than I had expected....I realized that because of fatigue from my work on [the musical] Gypsy...it would be foolhardy to attempt it if I rushed into rehearsal without assimilating the score.""[7]
Copland wrote that Dance Panels ""sat on the shelf"" until the Bavarian State Opera approached him in 1962 for a ballet to stage at the opening of their new house that November.[3] Once that offer came, the composer revised the score, partly in hope that Robbins could still choreograph it. Robbins again refused.[8][9]

Composition[edit]
Instrumentation[edit]
In keeping with Robbins' request for an intimate setting, Copland scored Dance Panels initially for six woodwinds and five brass.[6] Even when he revised the score,  the composer kept, in his words, to ""a moderate-sized orchestra of six woodwinds, five brass, two percussion (but no timpani) and strings.""[10]

Form[edit]
A typical performance of the ballet version lasts approximately 30 minutes. The concert version lasts 23 minutes. The music in both versions is ""essentially the same,"" Copland says; the difference in performance time arises from the number of extended pauses in the first section when the music is danced.[10]
The ballet is divided into seven sections, played without pause.

Introduction: Moderato. A quiet opening with long sustained notes, written in a slow waltz tempo.[11]
Allegretto con tenerezza. A continuation of the waltz rhythm, with ""charm and delicacy, involvements, hesitations and swirlings.""[12]
Scherzando. Light and transparent.[11]
Pas de trois. Marked ""Somewhat hesitant, melancholic and naive.""[12]
Con brio. Another scherzo-like section, infused, as Copland phrased it ""by brisk rhythms and jazzy drum patterns.""[11]
Con moto. A brief lyrical interlude, marked ""menacing"" and later ""eloquent.""[12]
Molto ritmico. The finale begins, according to Copland, ""by suggesting flight and hectic emotions."".[12] Written in jagged, irregular rhythms, the music is alternately joyous and frenetic. It ends quietly with material similar to the opening of the piece.[11]
Overall, Copland called the music ""simple and direct.... The lyrical parts are very diatonic ... while the lively and bouncy parts have more complexity of texture.""[11] In Music Since 1900, musicologist Nicolas Slonimsky notes the work as ""built in a translucidly intricate polyphonic reticle.""[13] Pollack points out that, while the composer acceded to Robbins' demand for music based on waltzes, he employed a stylized approach, which gave the vague feeling of the dance rather than an overt evocation.[6]

Significance of title[edit]
The ballet was variously titled Music for J.R., Music for a Ballet, The Dream and Ballet in Seven Movements before Copland settled upon Dance Panels: Ballet in Seven Sections.[3][6] The idea for the final title, Copland said, was from the ballet being in seven continuous sections, ""like the panels on a screen.""[6]

Resemblance to other Copland works[edit]
Dance Panels, Copland writes, is different from his earlier ballets—""more abstract ... lyrical and slower in tempo than most of my other ballet music.""[11] he also claimed he did not use any American folk melodies in it, though two sections contained aspects of ""the quiet sentimental song and a type of stage music used for 'tap dancing.'""[11]  Butterworth writes that, while the second section ""is one [of] the few passages similar to the pastoral movements in the three 'cowboy' ballets,"" no melodic or harmonic material elsewhere in the work resembles a Western setting[14] The quasi-folk songs and country dances indicative of those works, he adds, are likewise absent.[15] However, a passing resemblance to the fifth movement, Jingo, of Copland's Statements for orchestra, occurs in the third section.[15]
Pollack calls Dance Panels one ""of the most accessible scores of [Copland's] later years.""[12] He adds that some sections are reminiscent of the composer's earlier stage and screen music, while others seem to presage Copland's 12-tone scores such as Connotations and Inscape in their thick textures and harmonic dissonance.[16]

Reception[edit]
Copland conducted the world premiere of Dance Panels on December 3, 1963 at the Bavarian State Opera. While the work ""was greeted with great applause,"" the composer was disappointed with the choreography by Heintz Rosen.[9] He said he felt Rosen lacked ""feeling for the American quality of the music.""[17] George Balanchine considered choreographing the work for its United States premiere with the New York City Ballet but eventually gave the task to his assistant, John Taras.[18] Since Taras knew the composer was open to having the ballet mounted either with or without a story, he adopted one by Scott Burton. In it, two lovers meet in a cemetery, where their dancing is interrupted by various others buried there.[18] Titled Shadow'd Ground, the work was performed at the then-new Lincoln Center on January 21, 1965. It was neither a popular nor critical success.[18][19]
Copland remained concerned how the music would fare unstaged. The concert premiere, under Ingolf Dahl and the Ojai Festival Orchestra on May 24, 1966, proved this fear unfounded.[18] Pollack writes, ""As a concise, plotless, beautifully crafted ballet ... Dance Panels easily accommodated itself to the concert format"" and enjoyed ""considerably more success than it has on the stage.""[18] It has since been recorded under the direction of Leonard Slatkin, Dennis Russell Davies and the composer himself.[18]

Ballet by Jerome Robbins

Dances at a Gathering is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to music by Frédéric Chopin, with costumes designed by Joe Eula. The ballet premiered on May 22, 1969, at the New York State Theater, performed by the New York City Ballet.


Production[edit]
Dances at a Gathering is the first ballet Robbins created for the New York City Ballet (NYCB) in years, after he worked on Broadway theatre.[1] He first planned to make a pas de deux for Patricia McBride and Edward Villella, but it was eventually expanded to five couples.[2] According to NYCB, after George Balanchine saw 25 minutes of the ballet, he said: ""[m]ake more, make it like popcorn"", so Robbins enlarged the ballet to an hour long.[3] With costumes by Joe Eula and lighting by Thomas Skelton, the ballet had a gala preview on May 8, 1969, before premiering on May 22. Robbins dedicated the ballet to lighting designer Jean Rosenthal, who had died on May 1.[2]
Following the premiere, there were many speculations regarding the narratives of the ballet so Robbins wrote to Ballet Review in all caps to insist that the ballet has no stories, plot or roles, and the dancers are merely ""themselves dancing with each other to music in that place.""[4] In the ballet, the performers are credited by the colors of their costumes.[5] The ballet starts with a solo performed by Brown Boy, originally Villella, and in the middle of the ballet, a woman who had not appeared in the ballet before dances a solo.[4][6] In one section featuring three men and three women, the women are tossed from partner to partner. The most well-known part of the ballet is a pas de deux between Pink Girl (originally McBride) and Mauve Boy.[1] No more than six dancers are on stage at the same time until the finale.[4]

Other companies and revivals[edit]
The Royal Ballet in London premiered Dances at a Gathering in 1970, staged by Robbins himself.[2] When he taught the role originated by Villella to Rudolf Nureyev, who was regarded as one of the best ballet dancer in his generation, Robbins attempted to make Nureyev unrecognizable to the audience.[4] The Royal Ballet continued to perform the ballet until 1976, then did not revive it until 2008, staged by Susan Hendl and Ben Huys.[7] Robbins also staged the ballet for the Paris Opera Ballet, and the company debuted it in 1991.[2] The San Francisco Ballet first performed it in 2002, also staged by Hendl and Huys.[6]
In 2014, when original cast member Patricia McBride was honored at the Kennedy Center Honors, an excerpt of Dances at a Gathering was performed by Tiler Peck and Jared Angle.[8]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


This article is about choreographed versions of the ballet. For the musical composition, see Danses concertantes (Stravinsky).
Danses concertantes is the title of a work for chamber orchestra written in 1941–42 by Igor Stravinsky, commissioned by Werner Janssen. Stravinsky's music has been used for eponymous ballets by numerous choreographers attracted by its danceability.[1]


Balanchine versions[edit]
The title of Stravinsky's orchestral work makes clear his intention that it be used for dance performance. George Balanchine (1904–1983), his friend and colleague, took him at his word, creating two versions of a ballet set to his music: one for the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo in 1944 and one for the New York City Ballet in 1972.[2][3]

1944 version[edit]
Balanchine choreographed Danses concertantes as his first new work for the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo at the beginning of his two-year association with that company as choreographer. He began work on it in early summer of 1944, while the company was performing in Song of Norway, an operetta for which he had created dances and a ballet, in Los Angeles and San Francisco.[4] With scenery and costumes designed by Eugene Berman, Danses concertantes had its premiere on 10 September 1944 at New York's City Center of Music and Drama, with Robert Balaban as conductor. The cast was headed by Alexandra Danilova and Frederic Franklin, the brilliant and popular stars of the company. An effervescent work, it began and ended with parades. ""Between them,"" one observer wrote, ""came several rhythmically quirky pas de trois for company soloists and a demanding pas de deux for Danilova and Franklin.[5] The fourth variation was danced by Maria Tallchief, Nicholas Magallanes. and Mary Ellen Moylan.[6] Critical reception was mixed. John Martin, an advocate of modern dance, pronounced it ""a clever, somewhat mathematical job of choreography, almost totally devoid of dancing.""[7] An opposing view was put forth by Edwin Denby, a balletomane, who praised the ""joyousness"" of the piece.[8]

1972 version[edit]
Almost three decades later, Balanchine re-choreographed Danses concertantes for the New York City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival in 1972. The original designs for sets and costumes by Eugene Berman were re-created, and the structure of the piece was much the same, with beginning and ending parades, a sequence of pas de trois, and a pas de deux. The choreography was, however, largely different from the original, although it was similar in its neoclassical style. Only the fourth variation was similar in structure to the original pas de trois. The cast included Linda Yourth and John Clifford in the principal roles, supported by an ensemble of eight women and four men. The premiere was held on 20 June 1972 at the New York State Theater at Lincoln Center. Robert Irving conducted the orchestra.[9] One critic noted that the legendary reputation of the 1944 work ""promised somewhat more than [the 1972 work] delivered. Effects were made, but they quickly evaporated, generating a feeling of unease or inconclusiveness.""[10] A videorecording of a performance on 4 May 1989 by the New York City Ballet, with Darci Kistler and Robert LaFosse in the leading roles, is available in the Jerome Robbins Dance Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.

MacMillan version[edit]
Kenneth MacMillan (1929–1992) created his version of Danses concertantes in 1955 for the Sadler's Wells Theatre Ballet in London. It was his first major work, his first for the Sadler's Wells company, and his first (of an eventual seven) set to a Stravinsky score. With its bright, carnavalesque décor by Nicholas Georgiadis, then still a student at the Slade School, it had its premiere on 18 January 1955 at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in London. John Lanchbery conducted the orchestra. The cast included Maryon Lane and Donald Britton in the principal roles, supported by David Poole, Sara Neil, Gilbert Vernon, Annette Page, Donald MacLeary, and Bryan Lawrence. Macmillan's choreography for the suite of dances is sharp and spiky, with pointed fingers, angled ports de bras, and sudden changes of direction. ""There is a bustling general dance full of entrances and exits for the company, a pas de trois, a rumbustious solo for a male dancer, an adagio for the ballerina and five cavaliers, and a pas de deux. . . . [It is] fast, fleet, and contemporary, with hints of jive, revue, cinema, and the circus.""[11] It was an immediate success. Clement Crisp wrote of the first night's performance, ""I still recall how the eye was teased by the sparks of energy and wild originality given off by the movement, how the Georgiadis designs flowed and flashed, how bright-footed the young cast seemed.""[12] Ninette de Valois, artistic director of Sadler's Wells Ballet, was also favorably impressed, as she quickly took MacMillan's ballet into the repertory of the main company at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.[13]

Christensen version[edit]
A few years later, Lew Christensen (1909–1984) created his version of Danses concertantes for the San Francisco Ballet. With scenery and costumes designed by Tony Duquette, it had its premiere on 13 October 1959 at the War Memorial Opera House and was warmly received by critics and the public. Debra Sowell noted that ""it was a ballet within a ballet in which the dancers represented both performers and the audience.""[14] and Jack Anderson later observed that Christensen had ""let viewers decide for themselves whether the slight plotline was just a pretext for dancing or a more pointed comment on the 'shows' that socialites often put on at opera openings.""[15] Christensen's original cast of twenty-two included Nancy Johnson, Roderick Drew, Sally Bailey, Kent Stowell, Jocelyn Vollmar, Richard Carter, Virginia Johnson, Michael Smuin, Fiona Fuerstner, and Julien Harris. With a later cast, including Attila Ficzere, Vane Vest, Damara Bennett, Roberta Pfeil, Betsy Erickson, and John McFall, it was filmed for archival purposes on 29 March 1976 at the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco; the videorecording can be viewed at the Jerome Robbins Dance Division of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.[16]

Other versions[edit]
Basic information on all works listed here can be found in the database of dances set to Stravinsky's music compiled by Stephanie Jordan and Larraine Nichols and mounted on the website of the University of Roehampton, London.[17]

Job Sanders (1929–2008), a Dutch choreographer, created his version of Danses concertantes in 1964 for the Nederlands Dans Theater in The Hague. With designs by Anne Hyde, it had its first performance on 26 May 1964.[18]
Todd Bolender (1914–2004) created his version in 1964 for the ballet company of the Būhnen der Stadt Köln (Cologne Ballet) in Germany. With costumes by Ed Wittstein and a cast led by Ute Reusch, Hans Kressing, Petra Troitzsch, and Riccardo Duse, it was first performed on 9 July 1964 at the Opernhaus in Cologne.[19]
Félix Blaska (born 1941), a Polish-French choreographer, created his version in 1968 for the newly formed Ballet-Théâtre Contemporaine in Amiens, France. With designs by Sonia Delaunay, it was first performed on 4 December 1968. It was carried over to the repertory of Les Ballets de Félix Blaska in 1969.[20]
Leonid Yakobson (1904–1975) created his version in 1971 for his company, Choreographic Miniatures, in Leningrad, Russia.[21]
John Taras (1919–2004) created his version in 1971 for the Deutsche Oper Berlin. With designs by Georges Wakhévitch and with Didi Carli and Klaus Beelitz in the principal roles, it was first performed on 1 December 1971. It was set for a leading couple, three trios, and an accompanying group of six dancers.
Fernand Nault (1920–2006), French Canadian, created his version in 1972 for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in Montréal, Québec. With Sonia Taverner and Vincent Warren heading a cast of eight dancers, it was first performed in Théâtre Maisonneuve at Place des Arts. A lighthearted work, it was revived for the Colorado Concert Ballet in 1977.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


1912 ballet by Maurice Ravel
This article is about the Fokine ballet to Ravel's music. For the original story, see Daphnis and Chloe. For the operetta by Jacques Offenbach, see Daphnis et Chloé (Offenbach).
Daphnis et ChloéSet design by Léon Bakst for the world premiere of Daphnis et Chloé, Paris 1912.ChoreographerMichel FokineMusicMaurice RavelBased onLongus' Daphnis and ChloePremiere8 June 1912Théâtre du ChâteletParisOriginal ballet companyBallets RussesCharactersDaphnis, ChloéDesignLéon BakstSettingAncient GreeceCreated forVaslav Nijinsky and Tamara Karsavina
Daphnis et Chloé is a 1912 symphonie chorégraphique, or choreographic symphony, for orchestra and wordless chorus by Maurice Ravel. It is in three main sections, or parties, and a dozen scenes, most of them dances, and lasts just under an hour, making it the composer's longest work. In effect it is a ballet, and it was first presented as such. But it is more frequently given as a concert work, either complete or excerpted, vindicating Ravel's own description above. 
The dance scenario was adapted by choreographer Michel Fokine from a pastoral romance by the Greek writer Longus thought to date from the 2nd century AD, recounting the love between the goatherd Daphnis and the shepherdess Chloé. Scott Goddard in 1926 published a commentary on the changes to the story Fokine had to apply in order to make the scenario workable.[1]


Composition and premiere[edit]
Ravel began to write the score in 1909 after a commission from impresario Sergei Diaghilev for his Ballets Russes, completing it some months before the premiere of the staged work. This took place at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris on 8 June 1912, with sets designed by Léon Bakst, choreography by Fokine, and the Orchestre Colonne conducted by Pierre Monteux. Tamara Karsavina and Vaslav Nijinsky danced the shepherdess and goatherd.

Musical description[edit]
At almost an hour long, Daphnis et Chloé is Ravel's longest work. Four discernible leitmotifs give it musical unity.[1][2] The music, some of the composer's most passionate, is widely regarded as some of his best, with extraordinarily lush harmonies typical of the Impressionist movement; even during the composer's lifetime commentators described it as his masterpiece for orchestra.[3]

Suites of excerpts[edit]
Ravel extracted music from the symphonie to make two orchestral suites, which can be performed with or without the chorus. The first was prepared as early as 1911, that is, before the staging. The second, essentially Partie III of the whole, was issued in 1913 and is particularly popular. (When the complete work is performed it is more often in concert than staged.) Ravel adhered to his description of the music in his formal titling of the suites: 

Fragments symphoniques de ‘Daphnis et Chloé’ (Nocturne—Interlude—Danse guerrière), 1911, commonly called Suite No. 1
Fragments symphoniques de ‘Daphnis et Chloé’ (Lever du jour—Pantomime—Danse générale), 1913, or Suite No. 2
Instrumentation[edit]
Daphnis et Chloé is scored for a large orchestra consisting of:





Woodwinds

2 flutes (2nd doubling 2nd piccolo)

Scenario[edit]
Part I[edit]
Michel Fokine, Daphnis et Chloé, circa 1910
On the island of Lesbos, in a meadow at the edge of a sacred wood stands a grotto hewn out of rock, at the entrance of which is an antique sculpture of three Nymphs. Somewhat toward the background, to the left, a large rock vaguely resembles the form of the god Pan. In the background sheep are grazing. It is a bright spring afternoon. When the curtain rises, the stage is empty. Youths and girls enter, carrying gifts for the Nymphs in baskets. Gradually the stage fills. The group bows before the altar of the Nymphs. The girls drape the pedestals with garlands. In the far background, Daphnis is seen following his flock. Chloé joins him. They proceed toward the altar and disappear at a bend. Daphnis and Chloé enter at the foreground and bow before the Nymphs.
The girls entice Daphnis and dance around him. Chloé feels the first twinges of jealousy. At that moment she is swept into the dance of the youths. The cowherd Dorcon proves to be especially bold. Daphnis in turn seems upset. At the end of the dance, Dorcon tries to kiss Chloé. She innocently offers her cheek, but with an abrupt motion Daphnis pushes aside the cowherd and approaches Chloé affectionately. The youths intervene. They position themselves in front of Chloé and gently lead Daphnis away. One of them proposes a dance contest between Daphnis and Dorcon. A kiss from Chloé will be the victor’s prize. The group sarcastically imitates the clumsy movements of the cowherd, who ends his dance in the midst of general laughter. Everyone invites Daphnis to accept his reward. Dorcon comes forward as well, but he is chased off by the group, accompanied by loud laughter.
The laughter ceases at the sight of the radiant group formed by the embracing Daphnis and Chloé. The group withdraws, taking along Chloé. Daphnis remains, immobile, as if in ecstasy. Then he lies face down in the grass, his face in his hands. Lyceion enters. She notices the young shepherd, approaches, and raises his head, placing her hands over his eyes. Daphnis thinks this is a game of Chloé’s but he recognizes Lyceion and tries to pull away. As though inadvertently, she drops one of her veils. Daphnis picks it up and places it back on her shoulders. She resumes her dance, which, at first more languorous, becomes steadily more animated until the end. Another veil slips to the ground, and is again retrieved by Daphnis. Vexed, she runs off mocking him, leaving the young shepherd very disturbed. Warlike sounds and war cries are heard, coming nearer. In the middle ground, women run across the stage, pursued by pirates. Daphnis thinks of Chloé, perhaps in danger, and runs off to save her. Chloé hastens on in panic, seeking shelter. She throws herself before the altar of the Nymphs, beseeching their protection.
A group of brigands burst on stage, capture the girl and carry her off. Daphnis enters looking for Chloé. He discovers on the ground a sandal that she lost in the struggle. Mad with despair, he curses the deities who were unable to protect the girl, and falls swooning at the entrance of the grotto. As night falls, an unnatural light suffuses the landscape. A little flame shines suddenly from the head of one of the statues. The Nymph comes to life and descends from her pedestal, followed by the second and then the third Nymph. They consult together and begin a slow and mysterious dance. They notice Daphnis, bend down and dry his tears. They revive him and lead him toward the large rock, and invoke the god Pan. Gradually the form of the god is outlined. Daphnis prostrates himself in supplication.

Part II[edit]
Several pirates from the Ballets Russes premiere of Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé. 1912.
Voices are heard from off stage, at first very distant. A trumpet calls and the voices come nearer. There is a dull glimmer. The setting is the pirate camp on a very rugged seacoast, with the sea as the background. To the right and left is a view of large crags. A trireme is seen near the shore and there are cypresses present. Pirates are seen running to and fro carrying plunder. More and more torches are brought, which illuminate the scene. Bryaxis commands that the captive be brought. Chloé, her hands tied, is led in by two pirates. Bryaxis orders her to dance. Chloé performs a dance of supplication. She tries to flee, but she is brought back violently. Despairing, she resumes her dance. Again she tries to escape but is brought back again. She abandons herself to despair, thinking of Daphnis. Bryaxis tries to carry her off. Although she beseeches, the leader carries her off triumphantly. Suddenly the atmosphere seems charged with strange elements. Various places are lit by invisible hands, and little flames flare up. Fantastic beings crawl or leap here and there, and satyrs appear from every side and surround the brigands. The earth opens and the fearsome shadow of Pan is outlined on the hills in the background, making a threatening gesture. Everyone flees in horror except Chloé, who is given a wreath crown.

Part III[edit]
Enrico Cecchetti in costume as the old shepherd ""Lammon"" for the premiere of Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé
Morning at the grotto of the Nymphs. There is no sound but the murmur of rivulets produced by the dew that trickles from the rocks. Daphnis lies, still unconscious, at the entrance of the grotto. Gradually the day breaks. The songs of birds are heard. Far off, a shepherd passes with his flock. Another shepherd crosses in the background. A group of herdsmen enters looking for Daphnis and Chloé. They discover Daphnis and wake him. Anxiously he looks around for Chloé. She appears at last, surrounded by shepherdesses. They throw themselves into each other’s arms. Daphnis notices Chloé’s wreath. His dream was a prophetic vision. The intervention of Pan is manifest. The old shepherd Lammon explains that, if Pan has saved Chloé, it is in memory of the nymph Syrinx, whom the god once loved. Daphnis and Chloé mime the tale of Pan and Syrinx. Chloé plays the young nymph wandering in the meadow. Daphnis as Pan appears and declares his love. The nymph rebuffs him. The god becomes more insistent. She disappears into the reeds. In despair, he picks several stalks to form a flute and plays a melancholy air. Chloé reappears and interprets through her dance the accents of his flute. The dance becomes more and more animated, and in a mad whirling, Chloé falls into Daphnis’s arms. Before the altar of the Nymphs, he pledges his love, offering a sacrifice of two sheep. A group of girls enters dressed as bacchantes, shaking tambourines. Daphnis and Chloé embrace tenderly. A group of youths rushes on stage and the ballet ends with a bacchanale.

The Daughter of the Snows (also known as Snegurochka or La Fille des neiges) is a ballet in three acts and five scenes, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Ludwig Minkus.[1] The libretto by Marius Petipa is based on the 1873 play The Snow Maiden by Alexander Ostrovsky, inspired by a Russian folk fairy tale about Snegurochka from the folklore collection by Alexander Afanasyev.
The ballet premiered on 7 January 1879 at the St. Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kammeny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia by the Imperial Ballet. Prima ballerina Yekaterina Vazem considered it ""among Petipa's less successful ballets"" and ""not popular with the public."" According to Vazem, the ballet was taken out of the repertoire after only a few performances.[2]
Principal dancers: Yekaterina Vazem (as the Snow Maiden).

Retrieved 12 February 2024. The next new ballet created for me by Petipa was first produced for my benefit performance at the beginning of 1879. It was called Daughter of the Snows and, as I already mentioned, is among Petipa's less successful ballets; at any rate, it was not popular with the public. I appeared on the stage only in the second and third acts, devoted to classical dancing; the first act was completely taken up by character dances of various northern nations. I cannot remember clearly the ballerina's dances - they were probably not in any way remarkable. At the end of the ballet, I and Gerdt (as the Captain of the ship, which became icebound) and other dancers, performed a scene of 'Love and Resurrection'; but again I cannot recall anything about it. Daughter of the Snows was given only a few times and then taken out of the repertoire

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


For the make of car, see Ford Model B (1932) § Deuce coupe.
Deuce Coupe is a ballet by choreographer Twyla Tharp, set to music by the Beach Boys, for the Joffrey Ballet. The ballet has been in their repertory in several redactions since the 1970s, and is still being danced.
Deuce Coupe is often referred to as the first cross-over ballet,[1] combining classical ballet vocabulary with pedestrian actions, modern dance, jazz and a variety of movements of Tharp's own invention.

1836 ballet


Fanny Elssler as Florinda in the dance La Cachucha
Le Diable boiteux is a ballet in three acts by Jean Coralli, with music by Casimir Gide, which premiered on 1 June 1836 at the Paris Opera.[1][2] The main roles were played by Fanny Elssler, Joseph Mazilier, Amélie Legallois, Pauline Leroux and Jean-Baptiste Barrez. Loosely inspired by the novel of the same name by Lesage, this ballet was the first great success of Coralli who had, until then, mainly re-edited the ballets of other authors. The cachucha performed by Fanny Elssler was a sensational success.[3]

Le Dieu bleu is a ballet in one act choreographed by Michel Fokine to music by Reynaldo Hahn, set to a libretto by Jean Cocteau and Federico de Madrazo y Ochoa. Léon Bakst designed the sets and costumes.
The ballet was a failure at the premiere in Paris, on 13 May 1912 at the Théâtre du Châtelet. Le Dieu bleu was staged three times in Paris in 1912, three times in London in 1913,[1] and revived in London in April 2011 with music cobbled together from the works of Scriabin and with choreography by Wayne Eagling. The revival was not a success.


Background[edit]
Ballet impresario and producer Sergei Diaghilev staged two exotic ballets for the Ballets Russes: Cléopâtre in 1909 and Scheherazade in 1910, both great successes with the Parisian public. He hoped that Le Dieu bleu (another exotic ballet) would be equally successful.[2]
It was one of six new ballets for the 1911 Ballets Russes season. The others were Narcisse, La Peri, Le Spectre de la rose, Sadko, and Petrushka. Michel Fokine choreographed all of them, while Léon Bakst designed the sets and costumes for the first four. When Fokine and Bakst started work on Ida Rubinstein's ballet, Le Martyre de Saint Sébastien, Diaghilev felt betrayed. He pushed Dieu forward to 1912[2] although he lost interest in the ballet and spent huge amounts of money on the production in the hope that Dieu would make Vaslav Nijinsky a great international star.[1]
Fokine started work on Dieu in St. Petersburg in the winter of 1911–1912. He based some of his ideas for the ballet on the dances of the Royal Siamese Court ballet. This company had danced in St. Petersburg in 1900. Fokine also studied the arts of India, but in the end his dances for Dieu were uninspired and dull.[1]
Hahn's music could have been the reason, as it was not very good.[1] Prince Lieven, a critic and historian of the Ballets Russes, said the music had no interest or importance but only that it was ""sweet and insipid.""[3] Bakst based his ideas for the sets and costumes on the posters and printed materials for the Cambodian Ballet's 1906 productions in France.[4]

Premiere[edit]
The ballet was first presented by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 May 1912, coupled with another ballet, Thamar. Both ballets were failures. Diaghilev was shocked by the failure of Thamar. He thought it would be another success like Scheherazade. He was not surprised that Dieu was a failure and privately blamed Hahn's music for it. He was forced to use it because Hahn had rich friends in Paris, who would have cut their support of the Ballets Russes if the music had been rejected.[5]
The ballet was created for Nijinsky, who had yet to dance an important part for the Ballets Russes. He was cast in the lead role. Other dancers in the ballet were Max Frohman as The Young Man, Tamara Karsavina as The Young Girl, Lydia Nelidova as The Goddess, and Michel Federov as The High Priest. Nijinsky's sister Bronislava Nijinska was cast as The Drunken Temple Dancer.[2]

Plot[edit]
Set design by Bakst
The curtain rises on a warm evening in India, centuries in the past. In front of a rock temple, a pool is seen with a lotus on the surface of the water. Snakes, tortoises, and other animals rest near the pool. The temple walls are covered with masses of flowering plants.
A crowd is waiting for a ceremony to begin. The Young Man is about to become a priest of the temple. The Young Girl runs in and kneels at his feet. She does not want him to desert her for the priesthood and dances before him. The priests are shocked and lead The Young Man away while The Young Girl is prepared for death.
The gates are shut. The Young Girl tries to escape, but monsters rise from a place beneath a trap door. The Goddess rises from the lotus. The Blue God rises from the pool, and calms the monsters with his flute. The monsters are trapped by the masses of plants. The Blue God's work is done.
The priests enter. They are surprised to see The Young Girl still alive and fall on their knees before her. The Young Man rejoins The Young Girl. The Goddess orders a golden staircase to descend from the heavens. The Blue God flies up the staircase and disappears into the clouds.[2]

Reception[edit]
Bakst's costume design for The Blue God
Diaghilev hoped that Dieu would be a great success. Critics thought Nijinsky posed more than he danced. What they liked the most about the ballet was Bakst's sets and costumes.[1] Valery Svetlov wrote in the Mercure de France on 15 May 1912 that Dieu was ""a failure in every sense of the word.""[6]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The Display is an Australian ballet produced and choreographed by Robert Helpmann to music by Malcolm Williamson for The Australian Ballet. Described as the first wholly Australian ballet, The Display had an all-Australian cast, with sets and costumes by artist Sidney Nolan. The work had its world premiere on 14 March 1964 at Her Majesty's Theatre in Adelaide as part of the Adelaide Festival of Arts.


Background[edit]
Superb Lyrebird in courtship display
The inspiration for The Display came to Robert Helpmann in a dream in which he saw his friend, Hollywood actress Katharine Hepburn, naked on a dais surrounded by lyrebirds. Several years earlier, in 1955, Hepburn (then touring Australia with the Old Vic) took Helpmann to Sherbrooke Forest within Victoria's Dandenong Ranges to see his first lyrebirds in their natural surroundings. Helpmann was ""fascinated for hours"" by the birds' fanciful mating dance, referred to in ornithology as a courtship display, which Helpmann chose for the ballet's title. Helpmann eventually dedicated The Display to Hepburn.[1]
The Display draws parallels between the courtship rituals of the lyrebird and the mateship displayed by a group of Australian men as they attempt to seduce a woman at a bush picnic. The men play a game of Australian rules football, a sequence for which Helpmann invited VFL great Ron Barassi to coach the dancers.
Australian author and playwright Patrick White was originally approached by Helpmann to write the scenario for The Display, however, the two artists had a falling out over White's interpretation of Helpmann's vision, and White's libretto was rejected. For decades, it was assumed lost until dance historian Michelle Potter chanced upon a copy in the National Library entitled A scenario for a ballet by Patrick White.[2]

The first cast was:

Ballet by George Balanchine


Divertimento No. 15ChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicW. A. MozartPremiereMay 31, 1956 (1956-05-31)American Shakespeare TheatreOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignKarinskaJean Rosenthal
Divertimento No. 15 is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Mozart's eponymous music. The ballet was made for the New York City Ballet. Balanchine first choreographed the score in 1952, for a ballet titled Caracole. In 1956, he planned to revive Caracole for a celebration of Mozart's bicentenary but made a new ballet to the same music instead. Divertimento No. 15 premiered on May 31, 1956, at the American Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford, Connecticut.


Choreography[edit]
Divertimento No. 15 contains five movements, Allegro, Theme and Variations, Minuet, Andante and Finale.[1] The ballet is danced by five principal women, three men, and a corps de ballet of eight women.[2][3] Balanchine wrote that Divertimento No. 15 ""follows the different movements of the score. There is no story.""[2] Author Nancy Reynolds described the ballet as ""Balanchine's purest dance creations – a string of dancers, solos, ensembles, pas de deux – with muted emotional overtones and little virtuoso display.""[4]

Original cast[edit]
The principal dancers of the original cast were:[4]: 176 

Diana Adams
Melissa Hayden
Allegra Kent
Tanaquil Le Clercq
Patricia Wilde
Herbert Bliss
Nicholas Magallanes
Roy Tobias
Production[edit]
In 1952, Balanchine choreographed Caracole to Mozart's Divertimento No. 15 for the New York City Ballet. He first heard the score at a dinner,[5] and considered it the best divertimento.[6] He removed the second of two minuets and the andante opening of the sixth movement. The ballet also reused costumes Christian Bérard designed for Mozartiana.[5] The cast featured Diana Adams, Melissa Hayden, Tanaquil Le Clercq, Maria Tallchief, Patricia Wilde, André Eglevsky, Nicholas Magallanes, Jerome Robbins and a corps de ballet of eight women.[5] Despite receiving positive reviews,[5][7] it was absent from the repertory for some time.[8]
In 1956, Balanchine was to revive Caracole for a Mozart bicentenary celebration organised by Lincoln Kirstein, who also co-founded the New York City Ballet.[2] However, Balanchine claimed that he and the dancers had forgotten the choreography of Caracole, so he substantially rechoreographed it,[1][2] again with one of the minuet removed.[6] According to Joel Lobenthal's biography of Wilde, the solos remained the same as Caracole but other parts of the ballet were new choreography.[9] Other dancers in Caracole disagreed with Balanchine's claim, and said Caracole and Divertimento No. 15 are nearly identical.[6] The new Divertimento No. 15 is nevertheless regarded as a separate ballet.[4]: 137 [5]
The costumes were designed by Karinska, and the lighting was by Jean Rosenthal. When the ballet premiered, it featured a set that was originally designed by James Stewart Morcom for Balanchine's 1947 ballet Symphonie Concertante. In 1966, the costumes and set were redesigned. The new set, by David Hays, featured several trellis. Karinska redesigned the costumes. From the mid-1970s onwards, the ballet is performed without decor.[1]

Performances[edit]
Divertimento No. 15 premiered May 31, 1956, at American Shakespeare Theatre, Stratford, Connecticut.[3] The first New York performance of the ballet was in December that year. The principal dancers at the New York premiere were original cast members Adams, Hayden, Wilde, Bliss and Magallanes, as well as Yvonne Mounsey, Barbara Milberg and Jonathan Watts.[8]
Other ballet companies that had performed the ballet include Vienna State Ballet, Bavarian State Ballet, Dutch National Ballet, Ballet du Grand Théâtre de Genève, Hamburg Ballet, Pacific Northwest Ballet, Chicago Lyric Opera Ballet, Pennsylvania Ballet, Royal Danish Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, Birmingham Royal Ballet, Finnish National Ballet,[1] National Ballet of Canada,[10] Boston Ballet,[11] Miami City Ballet, Ballet Arizona,[12] Suzanne Farrell Ballet,[3] Dance Theatre of Harlem,[13] BalletMet and Cincinnati Ballet.[14][15]

Videography[edit]
In 1961, a New York City Ballet performance of Divertimento No. 15 was filmed for the CBC program L'Heure du concert in Montreal.[1]
In 1977, PBS's Dance in America broadcast a performance of the Andante movement from Divertimento No. 15 by the New York City Ballet, with a cast consisting of Tracy Bennett, Merrill Ashley, Maria Calegari, Susan Pilarre, Stephanie Saland, Marjorie Spohn, Victor Castelli and Robert Weiss.[16]
In 2020, during the New York City Ballet's digital fall season, which replaced the canceled repertory season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the company released an archival video of the Theme and Variations of Divertimento No. 15. It was recorded in 2016, and featured Lauren King, Sterling Hyltin, Ana Sophia Scheller, Abi Stafford, Tiler Peck, Andrew Veyette, Daniel Applebaum and Andrew Scordato.[17]
In 2021, for New York City Ballet's first virtual gala, held due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the finale of Divertimento No. 15 was featured in a film made by Sofia Coppola. It was danced by Peck, Veyette, King, Applebaum, Scordato, Emilie Gerrity, Ashley Laracey and Unity Phelan.[18]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




Christoph Willibald von Gluck by Joseph Duplessis (1775)
Don Juan ou Le Festin de Pierre (Don Juan, or the Stone Guest's Banquet) is a ballet with a libretto by Ranieri de' Calzabigi, music by Christoph Willibald von Gluck, and choreography by Gasparo Angiolini.  The ballet's first performance was in Vienna, Austria on Saturday, 17 October 1761, at the Theater am Kärntnertor. Its innovation in the history of ballet, coming a year before Gluck's radical reform of opera seria with his Orfeo ed Euridice (1762), was its coherent narrative element, though the series of conventional divertissement dances in the second act lies within the well-established ballet tradition of an entr'acte effecting a pause in the story-telling. The ballet follows the legend of Don Juan and his descent into Hell after killing his inamorata's father in a duel.


Background[edit]
The ballet Don Juan was based on Molière's Dom Juan ou le Festin de pierre of 1665.[1]
The 19th movement marked ""Moderato"" was used by Mozart in the third act finale of his opera Le nozze di Figaro. [2]

Ballet
This article is about the ballet by Marius Petipa. For other uses, see Don Quixote (disambiguation).


Don Quijote Compañía Nacional de Danza
Don Quixote is a ballet in three acts, based on episodes taken from the famous novel Don Quixote de la Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes. It was originally choreographed by Marius Petipa to the music of Ludwig Minkus and first presented by Moscow's Bolshoi Ballet on 26 December [O.S. 14 December] 1869. Petipa and Minkus revised the ballet into a more elaborate and expansive version in five acts and eleven scenes for the Mariinsky Ballet, first presented on 21 November [O.S. 9 November] 1871 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre of St. Petersburg.
All modern productions of the Petipa/Minkus ballet are derived from the version staged by Alexander Gorsky for the Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow in 1900, a production the ballet master staged for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg in 1902.


History[edit]
Earlier versions[edit]
The two chapters of the novel that the ballet is mostly based on were first adapted for the ballet in 1740 by Franz Hilverding in Vienna, Austria. In 1768, Jean Georges Noverre mounted a new version of Don Quixote in Vienna to the music of Josef Starzer, a production that appears to have been a revival of the original by Hilverding.
Charles Didelot, known today as the ""father of Russian Ballet"", staged a two-act version of Don Quixote in St. Petersburg for the Imperial Ballet in 1808. In 1809 a version of the work was mounted at Her Majesty's Theatre by James Harvey D'Egville. Paul Taglioni (brother of Marie Taglioni) presented his own version of Don Quixote for the Berlin Court Opera Ballet in 1839, and his uncle, Salvatore Taglioni, set a production at the Teatro Regio, in Turin, Italy, in 1843.

Marius Petipa's original production and revival[edit]
The most famous and enduring ballet adaptation was created by the choreographer Marius Petipa, unrivalled Maître de Ballet of the Tsar's Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, and the composer Ludwig Minkus. By special commission, Petipa mounted the work for the Ballet of the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. The production premiered on 26 December [O.S. 14 December] 1869 to great success.
Petipa then restaged the ballet in a far more opulent and grandiose production for the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet on 21 November [O.S. 9 November] 1871. This new production consisted of five acts (eleven episodes, a prologue, and an epilogue) and used the same designs as the first production.

Alexander Gorsky's revivals[edit]
Alexander Gorsky presented his revival of the ballet for the Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre on 19 December [O.S. 6 December] 1900, a production that he then staged for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg, premiering on 2 February [O.S. 20 January] 1902.
For his productions of 1900 and 1902 Gorsky added new dances to music by Anton Simon – a variation for the Queen of the Dryads, and a dance for her mistresses, as well as an additional Spanish dance for the last scene. When he staged the production in St. Petersburg in 1902, the ballerina Mathilde Kschessinskaya, who danced Kitri/Dulcinea added the famous Variation of Kitri with the fan for the ballet's final pas de deux, and the Variation of Kitri as Dulcinea for the scene of Don Quixote's dream.
It is widely believed that Gorsky interpolated the Grand Pas des toréadors from the 1881 Petipa/Minkus ballet Zoraiya, a piece that is still included in modern productions of Don Quixote. However, this piece was already in Don Quixote by the time Gorsky came to revive it as it was found published in the ballet score in 1882.[1] Therefore, the likelihood is that it was actually Petipa himself who interpolated the Grand Pas des toréadors in Don Quixote.
Gorsky's 1902 revival was not well received in St. Petersburg, causing shock among both Petipa and the balletomanes, who claimed that the production was a mutilation of Petipa's original masterpiece by one of his former students and dancers.[2]
The ballet lived on in Russia well after the revolution of 1917, whereas many other ballets ceased to be performed into the Soviet period. In fact, it became part of the permanent repertoire both of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre (the most famous productions being those of Rostislav Zakharov and Kasyan Goleizovsky in 1940, which included new music by Vassily Soloviev-Sedoy) and Leningrad's Kirov Theatre (which saw productions by Fyodor Lopukhov in 1923, with new choreography for the fandango, and by Pyotr Gusev in 1946, with the scenario modified by Yuri Slonomsky and with new dances introduced by Nina Anisimova).

From Russia to the rest of the world[edit]
Don Quixote was brought from Russia to other countries first by Anna Pavlova's company in 1924 in an abridged version of Gorsky's 1902 production, though the full-length work was not staged abroad for many years. The famous Grand Pas de Deux from the ballet's final scene was staged in the West as early as the 1940s, given first by the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo. The first full-length production mounted outside of Russia was a completely new staging, produced and choreographed by Ninette de Valois for The Royal Ballet in 1950. The first full revival of the original Russian production to be staged in the West was by Ballet Rambert in 1962. In 1966 Rudolf Nureyev staged his version for the Vienna State Opera Ballet, with Minkus' score adapted by John Lanchbery. In 1973, Nureyev filmed his version with the Australian Ballet and Robert Helpmann as Don Quixote. Mikhail Baryshnikov mounted his own version in 1980 for American Ballet Theatre, a production that has been staged by many companies, including the Royal Ballet, though the company would later stage Nureyev's version and most recently, Carlos Acosta's. Today the ballet has been staged by many companies all over the world in many different versions, and is considered to be among the great classics of the ballet.
American choreographer George Balanchine famously created a modern version in 1965 for the New York City Ballet to the music of Nicolas Nabokov, with Balanchine himself appearing as Don Quixote and Suzanne Farrell as Dulcinea and Francisco Moncion as Merlin.[3][4] This production had nothing to do with the Minkus version. It was only given until the mid-1970s and then taken out of the repertory of the company. In 2005 it was reconstructed by Farrell for the company, and continues to be performed.
First presented by San Francisco Ballet in 2003 under the staging of Helgi Tómasson and then-principal dancer Yuri Possokhov, Don Quixote has recently been revived by SFB. Possokhov spent his youth dancing with the Bolshoi Ballet, experience that provided unique insights and details that have been incorporated into the production. Another recent version has been created for the Royal Ballet at The Royal Opera House, Covent Garden; it has choreography by Carlos Acosta and the Minkus score has been adapted by Martin Yates, the scenery and costume designs are by Tim Hatley. More recently, the Moscow Festival Ballet is touring the ballet in the U.S. in 2014.

A performance of Don Quixote in Venezuela, 2013
In 1987, the Northern Ballet (UK) commissioned choreographer Michael Pink to create a three-act version with Artistic Director Christopher Gable in the role of the Don. The plot was reworked to include more of the adventures of the Don and Sancho Panza. The story of Kitri and Basilio, which traditionally runs throughout most versions of the full-length ballet is told in Act One of Pink's version. Act Two follows the Don and Sancho as they encounter a band of gypsies, are caught in a sandstorm resulting in the Don being knocked unconscious and his dream of Dulcinea. Act Three told the encounter of the Duchess and the bearded ladies to which the Don, blindfolded, imagines he rides a flying horse to kill the demon that has cursed the ladies. Toreadors and their ladies entertain the court, this includes the traditional grand pas de deux. The ballet ends after the arrival of the knight of the mirrors. Michael Pink restaged the work for the Milwaukee Ballet in 2005 with additional changes to the Prologue and Act Three. This production was presented again in 2014.

Prologue
Don Quixote's Study
Bachelor Sanson Carrasco is seen covering a bookcase with wallpaper, while Antonina is putting some rusty old armour and a helmet made of pasteboard into a cupboard. Don Quixote de la Mancha enters, reading a book. He goes to the bookcase and, not finding it, believes it has been stolen by evil magicians. Then he settles into an armchair and continues reading. He delights in stories of brave knights, fabulous giants and other fantastical creatures, but most of all Don Quixote dreams of his beloved Dulcinea, a woman that he believes to be so lovely and noble that she must be divinity. Gradually he nods and falls asleep to dream of their romantic adventures. Darkness falls.
Suddenly his servant, Sancho Panza, climbs hurriedly through the window. In pursuit are several angry women from the market from whom he has stolen bread and a chicken. Awakened by the commotion, Don Quixote sends the women away. Don Quixote tells Sancho that he is determined to seek adventures as a knight-errant, all the while searching for his beloved Dulcinea. He shows him the pasteboard helmet, which, with one sweep from his sword, becomes a shapeless mass on the floor. Antonina suggests that he should use a shaving basin instead, which would make a splendid helmet. Don Quixote enthusiastically agrees and, placing it on his head, orders Sancho to bring him his armour, sword and spear, and to make ready his horse, Rocinante.
Act I
A market-place in Barcelona
Kitri, an inn-keeper's daughter, steals out of her house to meet her beloved, the barber Basilio. Her father, Lorenzo, sees the lovers and sends Basilio away, bringing Kitri to tears. Now comes the rich nobleman Gamache, who, likewise in love with Kitri, goes to Lorenzo and asks for his daughter's hand. The innkeeper accepts with delight but Kitri, appalled at the thought of wedding the foppish nobleman, runs away.
Dancing begins in the square and some toreadors try to kidnap the girls they fancy, but their relatives and lovers hasten to their aid. At this moment Don Quixote arrives mounted on Rocinante, followed by Sancho, who is riding a donkey. At his master's command Sancho sounds his rusted horn, causing the townspeople to cover their ears. Lorenzo runs out of his inn, and Don Quixote, taking him for the lord of a famous castle, dismounts Rocinante and, falling to his knees, begs to be allowed to serve him. Charmed, Lorenzo invites the knight to sit on his balcony. Sancho remains in the square where he is surrounded by girls who induce him to take part in a game of blind man's bluff. Then some boys bring in a blanket on which they place Sancho and proceed to toss him into the air. Don Quixote hurries to his assistance and sets him free.
Peasants gather in the square and dancing resumes. Kitri returns and, noticing her, Don Quixote acclaims her as his Dulcinea, whom evil magicians have reduced to human form. Becoming jealous of her affection for Basilio, Don Quixote attempts to woo her by partnering her in a minuet. Lorenzo berates Kitri for carrying on with Basilio. Kitri and Basilio then run away, and Lorenzo and Gamache follow them. Don Quixote orders Sancho to bring Rocinante, so that he may also set out in pursuit.
Act II
Scene 1 – A camp of gypsies among the windmills outside the village
Kitri, disguised as a boy is seen walking with Harlequin from a troupe of travelling actors. They guess she is a girl and ask her to stay with them.
Scene 2 - The Puppet Theatre
A clown is seen walking with Graziosa, the gypsy chief's daughter. A gypsy tells the chief of the approach of Don Quixote. The chief plans a trick for his benefit and, putting on a mantle crown, sits down as though he were a king on a throne. Don Quixote is deceived and kneels to the chief in homage. The chief bids that he sit beside him and orders a festival to be given in his honor. This begins with Gypsy dances and is followed by a performance of the marionette theatre. Don Quixote is delighted with the entertainment but, mistaking the heroine for his Dulcinea and the marionettes for soldiers attacking her, he rises to assault them. The gypsies are terrified. At this moment the clown and Graziosa run away.
Scene 3 - The Windmills
Flushed with victory, the knight kneels and renders thanks to heaven. Seeing the Moon, he takes it for his Dulcinea and tries to get to her. As he approaches the windmills he can see the Moon no longer and thinks that evil magicians have hidden his beloved mistress. So, spear in hand, he tilts at the wings of the windmill, which he mistakes for a giant. Alas, the knight is caught by one of the wings and flung into the air. He falls unconscious at Sancho's feet.
Scene 4 – A forest
Through the trees appears Sancho leading Rocinante, upon which sits the wounded Don Quixote. The servant lifts his master down and places him on the grass, so that he may rest. Then, tying up the horse, he goes to sleep. Don Quixote also tries to sleep, but is troubled by fantastic dreams.
Scene 5 – The enchanted Garden of Dulcinea
Fairies appear surrounded by gnomes and Don Quixote finds himself dressed in shining armor. Then comes a succession of fearsome monsters, the last being a gigantic spider, who spins a web. The knight attacks the spider, which he slashes in half with his sword. At that same moment the spider's web vanishes to reveal a beautiful garden, filled with dryads and beautiful women, presided over by the Queen of the Dryads and Amor. Among them is Dulcinea and Don Quixote kneels before his beloved. At this moment everything vanishes.
Act III
The Square
Back at the square, Kitri and Basilio join those who are dancing. At the height of the merriment, Lorenzo and Gamache arrive, followed by Don Quixote and Sancho. Seeing his daughter, Lorenzo decides to give his blessing to her union with the nobleman Gamache. Basilio becomes annoyed and, reproaching Kitri for her unfaithfulness, draws a sword and stabs himself. As he lies dying he begs Lorenzo to unite him with Kitri, but Lorenzo and Gamache refuse. Don Quixote approaches Gamache and challenges him to a duel for having refused a dying man's wish. Gamache declines to fight and the merrymakers drive him out of the inn. Taking pity, Lorenzo agrees to unite Basilio and Kitri. At this moment, Basilio pulls out the sword and tells everyone it was a joke.
Act IV
The Tavern
A magnificent feast is held in honour of Don Quixote. Suddenly the Knight of the Silver Moon challenges him to a duel, which results in the latter being vanquished. The victorious knight proves to be none other than Bachelor Sanson Carrasco, who forces Don Quixote to vow that he will not unsheathe his sword for a whole year. The sorrowful knight, true to his vow, takes up his warlike gear and, followed by Sancho, sets out for home.

Petipa's second version from 1871[edit]
When Petipa revived Don Quixote in 1871 for the Imperial Ballet of St Petersburg, many changes were made to the libretto and he requested a new fifth act in three scenes from Minkus. Some of the changes included the following:[1]

Don Quixote no longer regarded Kitri as his protégée; now he actually mistakes her for Dulcinea and she appears as such in the dream scene. It was in this revival that the roles of Kitri and Dulcinea became a dual role, whereas in the 1869 Moscow production, they were danced by two different ballerinas.
Two new characters - the Duke and Duchess - were added and many of the comic scenes and character dances were cut.
Basilio's mock suicide was transferred to Act 2 and happened before the Windmill scene, rather than after.
The location for the fifth and final act was changed to the Duke and Duchess's castle.
The ending was changed - Don Quixote's duel with the Knight of the Silver Moon was cut and the ballet ended with an epilogue in which Don Quixote and Sancho Panza set out again on their quest after Kitri and Basilio's wedding.

One-act ballet adapted from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream
This article is about the Ashton ballet. For George Balanchine's 1962 ballet based on the same Shakespeare play, see A Midsummer Night's Dream (ballet).
For other uses, see A Midsummer Night's Dream (disambiguation).


The DreamChoreographerFrederick AshtonMusicFelix MendelssohnBased onA Midsummer Night's DreamPremiere2 April 1964Royal Opera House, LondonOriginal ballet companyThe Royal BalletDesignHenry Bardon and David WalkerSettingAncient GreeceTypeclassical ballet
The Dream is a one-act ballet adapted from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, with choreography by Frederick Ashton to music by Mendelssohn arranged by John Lanchbery. It was premiered by The Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 2 April 1964 in a triple bill with Kenneth MacMillan's Images of Love and Robert Helpmann's Hamlet.[1]


Background[edit]
The ballet was presented to mark the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's birth. Ashton drastically trimmed Shakespeare's plot, discarding Theseus and Hippolyta and the play-within-a-play, Pyramus and Thisbe. The focus of the ballet is on the fairies and the four lovers from Athens lost in the wood.[2] Lanchbery adapted the overture and incidental music Mendelssohn had written for the play in 1826 and 1842. Ashton and his designers, Henry Bardon and David Walker, set the action in or about the 1840s.[3]

Plot[edit]
In the forest outside Athens, Oberon, king of the fairies, fights furiously with his wife Titania, as they both want the same young Indian in their entourage. Oberon decides to punish Titania for her insolence and sends his servant, the mischievous fairy Puck, to look for a pansy: the dew of the flower, poured into the eyes of sleeping Titania, will make her fall in love with the first person she will see when she awakens.
Meanwhile, Oberon and Puck meddle in the lives of four mortal lovers who wander into their path.
Much confusion ensues, between the four mortals as their loves intertwine, and within a troupe of actors, one of whom is turned into a donkey to become Titania's lover.
In the end, Oberon and Titania make peace, and Puck brings things back to their natural order.

Critical reception[edit]
From the outset the piece received good reviews. Both The Times and The Observer noted that the men's roles were particularly strong. In the latter, Alexander Bland called the piece ""the first Ashton ballet to be slanted heavily in favour of the men"".[3] When the ballet was staged in New York in 2002, the critic Mary Cargill wrote of the Victorian setting:

For once, this time-shifting cliché works, because Ashton used the period's fantasies to create his magical ballet, not the period's realities. He did not choreograph Oberon as a top-hatted industrialist and Titania as his bouncy, bourgeois wife, as so many dreary, unimaginative productions of the play would have it, but modeled them on early Victorian fantasies. Ashton's choreography for the corps is an elegant and witty commentary on the period, with quick and silvery movements, and a soft, flowing upper body, with delicate echoes of the Romantic style (at one point Titania's four attendants strike the famous pose from the Pas de Quatre of the old lithographs, a beautifully designed picture in itself, and an extra joy for those who know their ballet history). Ashton distilled the action of the play to focus on the quarrels between Titania and Oberon, and between the lovers, ending in a magical reconciliation. His basic structure is flawless; the story takes place in a unified set, with the action flowing so smoothly that the dramatic skill involved is hidden.[4]
Revivals[edit]
Ashton's ballet was given by the Royal Ballet's touring company in the 1960s and 70s, with scenery and costumes designed by Peter Farmer. A new production, with Ashton's choreography reproduced under the direction of Anthony Dowell, was given at Covent Garden on 6 June 1986.[5]
Among other productions, Ashton's ballet has been given by the Australian Ballet (1969); the production taught from the Benesh notation score written by Faith Worth. In 1973 The Dream entered the rep of The Joffrey Ballet and set by John Hart and Faith Worth. The following three productions—-the Royal Swedish Ballet (1975), the Dutch National Ballet (1977), the National Ballet of Canada (1977)—-were staged by Faith Worth from her Benesh notation score. American Ballet Theatre (2002).[5] A performance by American Ballet Theatre at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, California, was videotaped in July 2003 and is available on a Kultur DVD. It stars Ethan Stiefel as Oberon, Alessandra Ferri as Titania, and Herman Cornejo in a defining performance as Puck.

Ballet by George Balanchine


Duo ConcertantChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicIgor StravinskyPremiereJune 22, 1972 (1972-06-22)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletCreated forKay MazzoPeter MartinsGenreNeoclassical ballet
Duo Concertant is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Stravinsky's score of the same name. The ballet was created for New York City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival, a tribute to the composer a year after his death, and premiered on June 22, 1972, at the New York State Theater, danced by Kay Mazzo and Peter Martins.


Choreography[edit]
Duo Concertant is danced by a man and a woman, alongside a pianist and a violinist, both onstage.[1] Kay Mazzo, an original cast member of Duo Concertant, said, ""In Duo Concertant Peter Martins and I just did the same thing over and over. Balanchine said that's what the music does.""[2]
In the first of five movements, Cantilena, the dancers simply stand and listen to the music. According to Mazzo, Balanchine told her, ""Now we're going to have them listen.""[3]: 279–280  In the next movement, the first Eclogue,[3]: 280  the two dancers, as New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff described, ""start dancing as if the music impels them to do so.""[1] Commenting on this movement of the ballet, dance critic Richard Buckle wrote, ""The two dancers experiment.""[3]: 280  The pair retreat to the piano when the second Eclogue begins, he then ""leads her to a pas de deux."" This is followed by the Gigue, which Buckle described, ""They dance both alone and together.""[3]
There is a blackout before the final movement, Dithyrambe. This movement is performed under a spotlight.[3]: 281  Kisselgoff analysed, ""the woman seemingly represents a muse. She and the man cannot find each other at first but finally she remains rooted to the spot as he kneels at her feet: the lover before his feminine ideal, the cavalier before the ballerina, Balanchine's artistic ideal.""[1] Mazzo was stunned by the emotional ending, ""It was quite unusual for [Balanchine] in his Stravinsky ballets.""[3]: 280 

Production[edit]
Stravinsky and Balanchine collaborated for many years until the former's death in 1971. The latter then decided to have the New York City Ballet hold the week-long Stravinsky Festival to honor the composer.[3]: 266–267 [4] There were at least 20 premieres,[4] seven of which were choreographed by Balanchine.[5]: 317 
Duo Concertant was made on Kay Mazzo and Peter Martins.[2] The festival marked the first time Balanchine choreographed on Martins, who in addition to Duo Concertant, also created a role in Stravinsky Violin Concerto.[5]: 350  Rehearsals started on April 11, 1972, and according to author Nancy Goldner, it was given fourteen hours. Mazzo, however, felt it was not complete until the last minute.[3]: 279  The dress rehearsal was held on the morning of the premiere. Balanchine did not tell the dancers he planned to have a blackout before the fifth movement until that rehearsal.[3]: 280 
Prior to Balanchine's death, he gave the rights of Duo Concertant to Mazzo.[3]: 317 

Performances[edit]
Duo Concertant premiered on June 22, 1972, at the New York State Theater.[6] Other ballet companies that have performed the ballet include The Royal Ballet,[7] American Ballet Theatre,[8] Boston Ballet,[9] Birmingham Royal Ballet,[10] Pacific Northwest Ballet[11] and the Suzanne Farrell Ballet.[12]

Videography[edit]
In 1975, Mazzo and Martins reprised their roles in Duo Concertant for the PBS Great Performances program ""Three by Balanchine with the New York City Ballet.""[13]
In 2004, Duo Concertant was filmed for a PBS Live from Lincoln Center broadcast performance, this time for Balanchine's centenary celebration, with dancers Yvonne Borree and Peter Boal, violinist Cho-liang Lin and pianist Cameron Grant.[14]
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the New York City Ballet released a 2019 archival recording of Duo Concertant online, featuring dancers Megan Fairchild and Anthony Huxley, violinist Arturo Delmoni and pianist Elaine Chelton.[15]
In 2021, for New York City Ballet's first virtual gala, an excerpt of Duo Concertant, danced by Ashley Bouder and Russell Janzen, was featured in a film made by Sofia Coppola.[16]

Dust is a one-act contemporary ballet about World War I, choreographed by Akram Khan, music by Jocelyn Pook and created for the English National Ballet. It marked the first time Khan worked with a ballet company, and premiered on 2 April 2014 at the Barbican Centre, London.


Production[edit]
Background[edit]
Akram Khan, choreographer of Dust
Akram Khan's Dust was commissioned for the English National Ballet's mixed bill, Lest We Forget, which is about the First World War and one of the first commissions by artistic director Tamara Rojo. For the mixed bill, Rojo said she chose choreographers who are British and from different backgrounds, including Khan, who was only trained in contemporary dance and Kathak. Though Khan had previously rejected all invitations from ballet companies, he accepted Rojo's offer, due to her ""passion"" and ""vision"".[1][2]

Choreography[edit]
Khan said the ballet is ""dominated by women"".[2] The first part is about trench warfare. Khan said he was ""intrigued"" about it as the soldiers would likely die once they leave the trenches, but continued to build them.[3] The middle section features women working in factories while their loved ones were fighting, and the weapons they made were likely to be used to kill others' loved ones. performed by 12 female dancers.[4][5] The third and last part is a duet originated by Khan and Rojo.[6] According to Khan, it is about the relationship between women and ""their loved ones at the front.""[3] Khan opted the female dancers to dance off pointe, because he needed ""to know the vocabulary of pointe work more deeply, to find out what I want to say with it.""[2]

Music[edit]
The ballet uses original composition by Jocelyn Pook, who had collaborated with Khan on two other projects before. For the final section, she wrote a song with lyrics from the poem ""In Flanders Fields"" , sung by counter tenor Jonathan Peter Kenny. She also used a recording of WWI soldier Edward Dwyer describing the war and singing ""we’re here because we’re here"" to the melody of ""Auld Lang Syne"". Pook said she had that recording prior to composing this ballet, but initially did not know Dwyer died in the war.[3][5][7]

Performances[edit]
In 2014, Dust, along with two other commissioned works for Lest We Forget premiered at Barbican Centre, which was not built for dance performances, and English National Ballet had never performed there before. At the premiere, Dust received rave reviews. Dance critic Jann Parry wrote that Dust was a ""resounding success for Khan as creator.""[8] The Independent also praised the ballet, writing it was ""dancing full of pain and power.""[9]
Later that year, Dust was performed at the Glastonbury Festival, danced by Erina Takahashi and James Streeter, making it English National Ballet's debut at Glastonbury.[10][11][12]
In 2018, on the hundredth anniversary of the end of the first world war, the Lest We Forget programme, including Dust, was revived at the Sadler's Wells Theatre, including a special performance for The Royal British Legion.[13] In 2020, a video of Dust, performed by Rojo and Streeter, was made available online by the English National Ballet in response to the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts.[4]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet by Jerome Robbins to music by Leonard Bernstein
This article is about Robbins' 1974 ballet. For Robbins' 1980 version, see Suite of Dances (ballet).

Dybbuk is a ballet made by New York City Ballet ballet master Jerome Robbins to Leonard Bernstein's eponymous music and taking S. Ansky's play The Dybbuk as a source. The premiere took place on 16 May 1974, at New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, with scenery by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, costumes by Patricia Zipprodt and lighting by Jennifer Tipton. A revision of the choreography and the score was made later the same year; the ballet was renamed Dybbuk Variations and received its own premiere in November.


Premise[edit]
Yiddish playwright S. Ansky’s The Dybbuk (1912–1919) centers around Khonnon and Leah, a young couple that has been promised for marriage to each other by their fathers before they were born. Before the wedding, Leah’s father breaks off the marriage with the penniless Khonnon, who dies instantly of a broken heart. However, Khonnon has his revenge when he enters Leah’s body in the form of an evil spirit called a dybbuk, which makes her act as though she is possessed. After rabbinical intervention, the likes of which Ansky had seen in exorcism-like ceremonies among the Hasidim when traveling through present day Belarus, Leah is forced to decide whether to marry the richer man or enter an unworldly union with the ghost of Khonnon. She chooses the latter to great dramatic effect at the fall of the curtain.[1]

Composition[edit]
In Dybbuk Bernstein used a Kabbalistic tree to derive some of the melodic motives. By Kabbalistic tradition, each letter of the Hebrew alphabet has its own numerical value. The name of the female lead in Dybbuk, Leah, is equal to the numerical value of thirty-six. Bernstein focused his composition on the divisions of thirty-six and eighteen (the numerical value of the Hebrew word chai (חַי‎), meaning ""life""), each multiples of the nine—the number of notes including the repetition of the top note in a symmetrical octatonic scale.[2] The result lent itself well to dodecaphonic composition but baffled critics, causing Oliver Knussen to write in Tempo, ""…it is surprising to encounter Bernstein making use of numerical formulas derived from the Kabbalah… and producing his most austerely contemporary-sounding score to date.""[3] Jack Gottlieb commented, ""The Dybbuk ballet (1974), however, marks a kind of departure for the composer since its concern with numerology results in far more hard-edged dissonant music (sometimes 12-tone) than in any of his other works.""[4]

The Dying Swan (originally The Swan) is a solo dance choreographed by Mikhail Fokine to Camille Saint-Saëns's Le Cygne from Le Carnaval des animaux as a pièce d'occasion for the ballerina Anna Pavlova, who performed it about 4,000 times. The short ballet (4 minutes) follows the last moments in the life of a swan, and was first presented in St. Petersburg, Russia in 1905. The ballet has since influenced modern interpretations of Odette in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake and has inspired non-traditional interpretations as well as various adaptations.


Legacy[edit]
The Dying Swan by Anna Pavlova (7 sec), ~1907; Yvette Chauvire (10 sec), ~1937; Natalia Makarova (14 sec)
Some ballerinas, including Ashley Bouder of New York City Ballet and Nina Ananiashvili, formerly of American Ballet Theatre and The Bolshoi Ballet, have used Dying Swan arms in Swan Lake when making Odette's exit at the end of Act II (the first lakeside scene).[1]
In response to impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, Carlos Acosta, artistic director of the Birmingham Royal Ballet, adapted Fokine's choreography with the ballerina raising her head at the end instead, and with Céline Gittens, principal dancer of the company, and the musicians performing in their respective homes.[2] Misty Copeland, principal dancer with the American Ballet Theatre, invited 31 other dancers to dance The Swan to raise fund for the relief fund of the participating dancers' companies and other related funds.[3]

125,Edward II,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_II_(ballet%29,"Edward II , John McCabe , 1995","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Edward II is a ballet in two acts, with music by the English composer John McCabe.
Commissioned by Stuttgart Ballet, with a narrative conceived by choreographer David Bintley, the ballet largely follows the plot of Christopher Marlowe's play of the same name, rather than the life of the real Edward. Bintley incorporates elements of the 14th century satire Roman de Fauvel with the character of Edward, replacing that of the ass Fauvel, Piers Gaveston as the Fool, and Queen Isabella as the Virgin. As such, the narrative depicts the self-obsessed sexual relationships of the three main characters with the increasing civil unrest in the country as a backdrop.
Although McCabe's score uses motifs associated with music of medieval times, the treatment is modern, with the orchestra including a large battery of percussion as well as a celesta and electric guitar.[1]
The ballet was premiered in Stuttgart on 15 April 1995. The UK première was given by the Birmingham Royal Ballet at the Birmingham Hippodrome on 9 October 1997. The score was recorded by Hyperion Records in 1999, with the Royal Ballet Sinfonia conducted by Barry Wordsworth.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

(Redirected from Élégie (ballet))
1944 composition for solo viola by Igor Stravinsky

Elegy is a composition by Igor Stravinsky for solo viola composed in 1944. It was dedicated to the memory Alphonse Onnou, the founder of the Pro Arte Quartet. The score bears no time signature, but the metronome marking sets the tempo at  = 56. The opening section is in the style of a chant above a rippling accompaniment. The middle section contains elements of a fugue, though there are never more than two independent voices. After its climax, the Elegy closes with a recapitulation of its opening. The viola is directed to play with mute throughout.[1]
The piece can alternately be played by a solo violin pitched a fifth higher.[1]


Choreography[edit]
ÉlégieChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicIgor StravinskyGenreNeoclassical balletTypeClassical ballet
Elegy was later choreographed as a neoclassical ballet by George Balanchine. He made three versions of the ballet, premiered in 1948, 1966 and 1982 respectively.

External videos Carla Körbes in ""Elégie"" - 2012 Vail International Dance Festival
, YouTube video
The first version, a pas de deux, premiered on April 28, 1948 at the City Center of Music and Drama, during a  Ballet Society performance, with dancers Tanaquil Le Clercq and Pat McBride, and violist Emanuel Vardi. Stravinsky described this version as a preview of a pas de deux from the ballet Orpheus.[2]
The second version is a solo which premiered on July 15, 1966 at the Philharmonic Hall, performed by dancer Suzanne Farrell and violist Jesse Levine, in a program about Stravinsky directed by Lukas Foss. The New York City Ballet premiered it later that month with the same cast.[3]
The last version, again with Farrell, premiered on June 13, 1982 at the New York State Theater,[4] as part of NYCB's Stravinsky Centennial Celebration, with Warren Laffredo playing the viola on stage.[5] Balanchine died the following year.[6] It was not revived until 2012 at the Vail Dance Festival, danced by Pacific Northwest Ballet's Carla Körbes. Artistic director of the festival Damian Woetzel learned the choreography via tapes of Farrell, then taught it to Körbes. In 2020, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the festival streamed video of the 2012 performance online.[7][8]

Elite Syncopations is  a one-act ballet created in 1974 by Kenneth MacMillan for The Royal Ballet.[1]


Background and productions[edit]
The piece was premiered by The Royal Ballet on 7 October 1974 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, with costume designs by Ian Spurling, lighting designs by John B. Read and staging by Julie Lincoln. The ballet is for 12 dancers. It is described as having an up-beat, hip swinging aura of spontaneity, with 'easygoing rhythms'. The band, also 12-strong, sit casually at the back of the stage playing while the dancers perform in front of them, adding to the 1920s party-like atmosphere.[1]
A BBC film of Elite Syncopations was also made in 1975 and danced by The Royal Ballet's original cast, in Battersea's Big Top.[1] The piece entered the repertory of Birmingham Royal Ballet on 10 February 1978 at Sadler's Wells Theatre.[2]

Music[edit]
The 'Classic' ragtime composers represented in the production are: Scott Joplin, Scott Hayden, Joseph F. Lamb and James Scott and Robert Hampton.
The centrepiece was composed by Scott Joplin.[3] Joplin also wrote a ballet called The Ragtime Dance (performed in 1899) as well as two operas, only one of which survived, called 'Treemonisha' (1902).
MacMillan added some additional ragtime tunes to complete his ballet: Paul Pratt's Hot-house Rag and James Scott's Calliope Rag for piano; Joseph Francis Lamb's Ragtime Nightingale orchestra and Alaskan Rag for piano; Max Morath's The Golden Hours for piano; Donald Ashwander's Friday Night and Robert Hampton's Cataract Rag for orchestra.
The full score list is:

""Sunflower Slow Drag"" (1901) – Scott Joplin (1867/8–1917) with Scott Hayden (1882–1915)
""Elite Syncopations"" (1902) – Scott Joplin
""The Cascades"" (1904) – Scott Joplin, arr. E.J. Stark (1868–1962)
""Hot–House Rag"" (1914) – Paul Pratt (1890–1948)
""Calliope Rag"" (c. 1910; rev. Darch 1964) – James Scott (1885–1938) [and Robert Darch]
""Ragtime Nightingale"" (1914) – Joseph F. Lamb (1877–1960)
""The Golden Hours"" (1966) – Max Morath (b. 1926)
""Stoptime Rag"" (1910) – Scott Joplin
""The Alaskan Rag"" (posthumously published) – Joseph F. Lamb
""Bethena: a Concert Waltz"" (1905) – Scott Joplin
""Friday Night"" (1965) – Donald Ashwander (1929–94)
""Cataract Rag"" (1914) – Robert Hampton (1890–1945)
Original cast[edit]
The ballet was premiered in Covent Garden on 7 October 1974: The principal roles were danced by:

Merle Park – Stop Time Rag
Donald Macleary
Monica Mason – Calliope Rag
Michael Coleman – Friday Night
Jennifer Penney – The Cascades
David Wall
Vergie Derman – Alaskan Rag
Wayne Sleep – Alaskan Rag
Wayne Eagling
Jennifer Jackson

David Drew
David Adams
Reception[edit]
Initial reception was mixed. The reviewers in The Times and The Observer found the piece vulgar and unstylish,[4] but Dance and Dancers thought it ""cheerfully diverting"" with ""some of the Royal Ballet’s best and most distinctive principals displaying new facets of their artistry in the choreography MacMillan devised for them.""[1] When the piece was presented in New York in 1976, The New York Times gave it enthusiastic praise,[1] and  it has remained popular with audiences.[5] In 2003 DanceView commented, ""Elite's humor is broad and the choreography simple minded. However, the work offered opportunities for dancers to let loose"".[5]

La Forêt enchantée (en. The Enchanted Forest) (ru. «Очарованный лес», Ocharovanyi les) is a ballet fantastique in one act, originally choreographed by Lev Ivanov to the music of Riccardo Drigo,[1] first presented by students of the Imperial Ballet School in St. Petersburg, Russia, at the school's theatre on 5 April [O.S. 24 March] 1887.[1]


History[edit]
La Forêt enchantée was originally produced for the Imperial Ballet School's annual graduation performances. The ballet was Lev Ivanov's first original work after having recently been appointed second maître de ballet to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres.[1] The ballet was also the composer and conductor Riccardo Drigo's first complete score for a full-length ballet.[1][2]
La Forêt enchantée was soon transferred to the repertory of the Imperial Ballet. The first performance was given on 15 May [O.S. 3 May] 1887 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre on a bill with Jules Perrot's ballet La naïade et le pêcheur.[1]
Riccardo Drigo's score was received positively. The critic for the newspaper The New Time reviewed that "" ... the music of this ballet is outstanding in a symphonic sense, reveals an experienced composer, a man with taste, and an excellent orchestrator. There are beautiful melodies in it, the rhythms are not overdone, and everything is listened to with pleasure from beginning to end.""[1] The score was eventually published in 1909 in piano reduction and orchestral partition by the music publisher Zimmerman.
La Forêt enchantée was chosen by the director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres Ivan Vsevolozhsky to be revived by Marius Petipa for performances attended by the Imperial Russian court at Peterhof on 25 July [O.S. 13 July] 1889.[1] After the performance of the Peterhof revival, the ballet was performed with regularity on the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre, becoming a favorite of many ballerinas at the turn-of-the 20th century. La Forêt enchantée was performed for the last time during the Imperial Ballet's summer season at Krasnoe Selo on 15 June [O.S. 2 June] 1907.[1]

Synopsis[edit]
In an old forest in Hungary, Ilka walks with her friends. Suddenly they are taken unawares by a storm. In the confusion Ilka is separated from her friends and cannot find her way out of the forest. As the storm rages on, she becomes frightened and falls faint. She is then discovered by dryads and other forest creatures who take delight in her beauty, but they frighten her upon awakening. The Genie of the Forest enters and soon falls in love with Ilka. With the aid of the forest creatures, the Genie begs Ilka to become his queen. Upon learning that she has a human fiancé, the Genie threatens her and she falls faint again. Mortals are now approaching and the forest creatures withdraw. Peasants find Ilka. Among them is Josy, her intended, to whom she recounts her experiences with the Genie of the Forest. The ballet ends with rejoicing and dances.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




Enigma VariationsChoreographerFrederick AshtonMusicEdward ElgarPremiere25 October 1968Royal Opera House, LondonOriginal ballet companyThe Royal BalletDesignJulia Trevelyan OmanSettingWorcestershire, England, 1899
Enigma Variations (My Friends Pictured Within) is a one-act ballet by Frederick Ashton, to the music of the Variations on an Original Theme (Enigma Variations), Op. 36, by Edward Elgar. The work was first given by the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, on 25 October 1968. It has been revived in every subsequent decade.


Background[edit]
Elgar's variations portray, in his words, ""My friends pictured within"", celebrating, and in some cases caricaturing, members of his circle. He commented to one of them, Troyte Griffith, years after the premiere that if the variations had been written by a Russian rather than an Englishman they would long ago have been turned into a ballet.[1] It was not until six years after the composer's death that an attempt was made to do so, by the choreographer Frank Staff for Ballet Rambert in 1940.[1] Staff's ballet focused on the mood of the variations rather than on the personalities who inspired it.[1]
The idea for Ashton's ballet originated in the early 1950s, when the designer Julia Trevelyan Oman, then still a student, submitted designs for a ballet to be based on Elgar's music. At the time the idea was not taken up, but in the 1960s Ashton had come round to it, and invited Trevelyan Oman, by then a rising star of theatre design, to collaborate.[2]
Ashton used the whole of Elgar's published score, with the exception of the finale, for which he went back to the composer's original ending. When completing the score in 1898, Elgar had been persuaded by his publisher (portrayed as ""Nimrod"" of the variations) to add a further 96 bars to the ending. With the permission of the Elgar estate, Ashton used the shorter version, previously unheard by even the most dedicated Elgarians.[3] The playing time of the ballet is about half an hour.

Synopsis[edit]
The piece shows an imaginary gathering of Elgar and his friends at the Elgars' house in Worcestershire. The composer, at this point in his career struggling and little known, is awaiting a message from London. While they are waiting, the Elgars and their friends are portrayed in dances representing their personalities. After the last of these, Ashton contributes his own ""enigma""; a telegram arrives: the characters know, but the audience does not, that it is from the celebrated conductor Hans Richter agreeing to conduct Elgar's new work. There is an exuberant finale.[1]
Ashton, drawing on a commentary written by the composer in 1929,[n 1] included in the programme alongside the cast list the notes in the third column, below. The words in quotation marks are by Elgar.



Theme (andante)

Edward Elgar (E.D.U.)




Var. I.

The Lady – Elgar's wife (C.A.E.)

""Whose life was a romantic and delicate inspiration.""


Var. II.

Hew David Steuart-Powell (H.D.S-P.)

One of Elgar's chamber-music cronies.


Var. III.

Richard Baxter Townshend (R.B.T.)

An amiable reedy-voiced eccentric who rode about on a tricycle.


Var. IV.

William Meath Baker (W.M.B.)

""With a slip of paper in his hand forcibly read out the arrangements for the day and hurriedly left with a bang.""


Var. V.

Richard Penrose Arnold (R.P.A.)

Son of Matthew Arnold, a quiet contemplative scholar.


Var. VI.

Isabel Fitton (Ysobel)

Charming and romantic


Var. VII.

Arthur Troyte Griffith (Troyte)

A very close friend, outspoken and brusque though ""the boisterous mood is mere banter.""


Var. VIII.

Winifred Norbury (W.N.)

""Her gracious personality is sedately shown.""


Var. IX.

A.J. Jaeger (Nimrod)

This variation recalls a summer evening's talk about Beethoven and, further, reveals the depth of a friendship.


Var. X.

Dora Penny (Dorabella)

""The movement suggests a dance-like lightness."" An intimate portrait of a gay but pensive girl with an endearing hesitation in her speech.


Var. XI.

George Robertson Sinclair (G.R.S.)

Or rather ""his bulldog Dan who fell into the river and barked rejoicing on landing. G.R.S. said 'Set that to music.' I did; here it is.""


Var. XII.

Basil G. Nevinson (B.G.N.)

""An amateur cello player of distinction – a serious and devoted friend.""


Var. XIII.

*** (Lady Mary Lygon)

""The asterisks take the place of the name of a lady who was, at the time of the composition, on a sea voyage.""


Var. XIV.

Finale ""E.D.U. (Edward Elgar) ""

""Written at a time when friends were dubious and generally discouraging as to the composer's musical future"", this variation is merely to show what he intended to do. References to Alice Elgar and to Nimrod, two great influences on the life and art of the composer, are entirely fitting to the intention of the piece.

Critical reception[edit]
In The Times, John Percival wrote, ""There have been plenty of ballets about love, but friendship as a subject is rare, and Ashton finds rare and moving expression for it. … What a pleasure it is, after so many ballets about fairytale characters and melodramatic situations, to see credible, adult characters like these on the stage of the Opera House.""[1][6] In The Observer, Alexander Bland found the character of Elgar himself remained ill-defined, but thought the work ideal for ""Ashton's delicate water-colour talent and his inimitable gift for inventing short flowing variations, and it is a fine vehicle for the smooth, soft Royal Ballet style.""[7]
One dissenting voice was that of Bernard Levin in The Times, who wrote that the choreography did not enhance one's appreciation of the characters depicted in the music, but impeded it: ""it was like those television sports commentators who carefully tell us what we have just seen.""[8] In 2002, Joan Acocella wrote in The New Yorker of ""a number of central-casting English eccentrics running around in tweeds and brandishing ear trumpets. But the center of the piece is Elgar, and Ashton has fleshed out his portrait. … No other ballet choreographer has examined normal emotions with such sophistication.""[9]

Revivals[edit]
The ballet has been revived by the Royal Ballet in each decade since the premiere. As of 2020 the most recent Royal Ballet production was in December 2019 as part of a heritage program featuring Kenneth MacMillan's Concerto and Act III of Rudolf Nureyev's Raymonda.[10] One of the performances was relayed in cinemas and later released on a DVD. This cast featured Laura Morera as the Lady Elgar, Christopher Saunders as Edward Elgar, Francesca Hayward as Dorabella and Matthew Ball as Troyte.[11][12]
Outside of The Royal Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet, the only other Ballet Company that has been given permission to perform Frederick Ashton's Enigma Variations is The Sarasota Ballet, which most recently performed the ballet in honor of the piece's 50th Anniversary in December 2018 alongside Frederick Ashton's Les Patineurs and George Balanchine's Diamonds.[13]

Ballet by Martha Graham and George Balanchine

Episodes is a ballet choreographed by Martha Graham and George Balanchine, to compositions by Anton Webern. The ballet was a co-production between the Martha Graham Dance Company and Balanchine's New York City Ballet (NYCB). Though it was conceived to be a collaboration between Graham and Balanchine, leading choreographers in modern dance and neoclassical ballet respectively, they ultimately worked separately on the ballet's two halves. Episodes I was choreographed by Graham, for dancers from her company and four NYCB members, and depicts Mary, Queen of Scots remembering the events in her life before her execution. Episodes II, by Balanchine, is completely plotless, and made for members of the NYCB and Graham dancer Paul Taylor, who originated a solo. The ballet uses all seven orchestral compositions by Webern.
Episodes premiered on May 14, 1959, at the City Center of Music and Dance. Starting in 1960, Balanchine's section is presented as a standalone piece, with Taylor's solo removed the following year. Since then, Balanchine's Episodes had been revived by both NYCB and other ballet companies, with Taylor's solo performed in a few rare instances. The complete Episodes has not been seen in full since 1959, and the Graham section had only been revived once, in 1980, with the choreography significantly revised.


Choreography and analysis[edit]
The program for the premiere of Episodes described it as an 'homage by dancers to a great composer.""[1] In performances of the complete ballet, a five-minute intermission occurs between Episodes I and Episodes II. Most performances of Episodes since 1960 only include Balanchine's Episodes II.[2] Graham dancer Ethel Winter commented on the aesthetic differences between Episodes I and Episodes II,I was listening to a couple of people talking. Somebody asked the difference between modern dance and ballet and how would someone know between the two. So the other one said, ""Oh, they will be in bare feet in modern dance and they will be flexing their feet with just tights on—no costumes."" Of course, Episodes was completely the opposite. Martha's company were the ones in shoes and full costumes; Balanchine's New York City Ballet [dancers] were in tights, flexing their feet and arms. Somebody must have been very confused![3]
Episodes I[edit]
The program described Episodes I as follows, Miss Graham's section of Episodes deals with the last minutes in the life of Mary Queen of Scots. It takes place at the scaffold and the characters are men and women who might well have been in the Queen's last thoughts. Bothwell, the man she most loved, was her third husband; determined to be King, he had used her to serve his ambition and treated her, so the court said, 'like a drab'. Darnley (her second husband), Rizzio and Chastelard, all three had died because of her. The four Marys, her ladies in waiting, had been her constant companions. Elizabeth of England, whom she had never met, was her cousin and enemy, and had signed the warrant for her execution. Miss Graham's choreography is a kind of dramatic fantasia about Mary Stuart's ultimate pride, about the façade of royalty and what must have been behind it.[4]
The two pieces of music Graham used,  Passacaglia, op. 1 and Six Pieces, op. 6, are Webern's earlier works, that are more orchestrated compared to his later works.[5][6] The dancers are dressed in full 16th-century costumes.[7] The set features a black platform at the back of the stage, decorated with heraldic symbols, with a black box at the center.[8][9]
In 1980, Graham significantly revised the choreography, with more focus on the two queens, and Mary's three lovers removed. The solos were also rechoreographed.[10][11]

Episodes II[edit]
Paul Taylor in Episodes
The program only described Episodes II, ""George Balanchine's section of the ballet refers to no story.""[1] Balanchine later said that in choreographing Episodes II, he ""had try to paint or design time with bodies in order to create a resemblance between the dance and what was going on in the sound.""[12] He used four of Webern's later works, written after he began exploring serialism and inspired by Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique. Additionally, Balanchine used Webern's Ricercata, rearrangements of the ricercars in Bach's The Musical Offering.[1] The dancers are dressed in practice clothes, while the minimal set features four poles.[13]
Episodes II begins with Symphony, op. 21. It is danced by two lead dancers and three other couples.[12]| Balanchine described, ""As the music starts, dryly and carefully. The boys touch the girls on the shoulder; they join hands then, pose briefly, and begin to move together. One couple leads the others but soon, just as the instrumentation shifts and develops, the other pairs react to the music differently. The dance is about the music, it is meant to look that way.""[9]
The second part, set to Five Pieces, op. 10, is a pas de deux. Author Jennifer Homans described the two dancers ""in total darkness, each under a separate spotlight... Their steps were hieratic, angular, with splayed, trapped movements and tangled deadweight arms, and they were engrossed with each other but disconnected, with a musical but no narrative arc.[13] At one point in this section, the man, as Homans described, lifts the woman ""upside down on his back with her legs split like antler's horns around his head, which now seemed to emerge from her crotch.""[13]
The third part, set to Concerto, op. 24, is also a pas de deux, with four women accompanying the two dancers. Balanchine described, ""The boy moves the girl as the composer moves his instrument.""[9] Allegra Kent, who originated the female role, called the section ""a dance conversation,"" and the role ""a continuation of his interest in the abstract use of the body and the man manipulating the woman.""[14]
Variations, op. 30 is a solo that was originated by Graham dancer Paul Taylor, and excluded from most stagings of the ballet. The solo is danced barefoot, and has three sections. The first two feature the same choreography, albeit danced to different music and with different intentions.[15] Author Richard Buckle commented, ""The white-clad dancer was called upon to clutch himself, wrap himself up and tie himself into such perverse knots that his number seemed almost a defiant demonstration by Balanchine that he could be as crazy as any 'modern' choreographer or dancer in existence.""[16] Taylor described, ""Each phrase is densely packed with complicated moves – knotted arrangements that, spatially, all stay in one small spot. Very few of them come from the traditional ballet vocabulary, and when they do, are usually reshaped into flex-footed versions or inverted.""[17] Balanchine gave Taylor the imagery of a fly in a glass of milk, and Taylor in turn thought of a fly stuck in a ""deadly vortex of its own making... an epigram about self-ordained patterns and death.""[18]
The ballet ends with the Ricercata, danced by two principals and a corps de ballet of thirteen women.[16] Author Nancy Reynolds commented, ""In contrapuntal manner, each dance movement – by a block of the ensemble or the soloists –  is an equal component of the whole stage picture at any single moment. Most movements are brief, often using only one part of the body at a time. The groups move fugally, in imitation (more or less freely) of the restatements of the musical object.""[19] Dance historian Angela Kane believed that Balanchine's choice of music for the closing section ""was to highlight distinctions between past and present, both in terms of musical lineage from Bach's baroque style to Webern's progressive serialism, and also between Graham's historical 'fantasia' and Balanchine wanting to move forward choreographically.""[20]

Development[edit]
Background and conception[edit]
(Left to right) Anton Webern, Martha Graham and George Balanchine
Balanchine worked primarily in neoclassical ballet, and co-founded the New York City Ballet with Lincoln Kirstein in 1948. Meanwhile, Graham was a modern dance choreographer, and usually worked with her own company, the Martha Graham Dance Company, and had created the Graham technique.[21][22] Kirstein, also the general director of NYCB, often criticized modern dance, including a 1934 article in The New Republic, in which he attacked Graham. Despite his continued dislike of modern dance, he acknowledge in 1937 that he ""was unequipped for her simplicity and self-blinded by her genuinely primitive expression.""[23] A collaboration between Balanchine and Graham was first pitched by painter Pavel Tchelitchew in December 1935. He suggested to the two choreographers and Kirstein that they collaborate on ""an evening's spectacle involving three archetypes: Don Juan, Don Quixote, Hamlet,"" while Graham would be the corresponding ""feminine archetype."" The idea never came to fruition.[24]

In the 1950s, Balanchine began listening to music by Anton Webern, after being introduced to his works by Igor Stravinsky.[25] Balanchine spoke about Webern's works[2]Webern's orchestral music fills the air like molecules; it is written for atmosphere. The first time I heard it, I knew it could be danced to. It seemed to me like Mozart and Stravinsky, music that can be danced to because it leaves the mind free to see the dancing. In listening to composers like Beethoven and Brahms, every listener has his own ideas, paints his own picture of what the music represents. How can I, a choreographer, try to squeeze a dancing body into a picture that already exists in someone's mind? It simply won't work. But it will with Webern.
He had two ideas of using Webern's music for a ballet that were abandoned, before deciding to use all seven of Webern's orchestral compositions, which last under an hour together.[25] Kirstein then suggested having Graham contribute on the choreography.[25] Graham was approached about the ballet by Kirstein in January 1959, and he spoke about ""key characters of feminine distinction"" for her to dance. He thought about an interpretation of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which Kirstein believed to carry the ""essence of Martha's spirit."" Graham, unable to respond to this but still interested in the collaboration, suggested Mary, Queen of Scots instead.[24] Graham dancer Linda Hodes recalled that Graham was hesitant about accepting the commission, but believed it was due to Graham's rejection of ballet traditions.[26] The title, Episodes, came from Tchelitchew's pitch.[24]
Though the ballet is conceived as a collaboration, the two choreographers mostly worked on their parts separately. Graham said, ""Collaboration was really not the term.""[27] Graham was set to choreograph the long opening and closing of the ballet, with Balanchine choreographing the rest. However, this plan ""did not work out practically of theatrically,"" according to Graham. The two choreographed the two halves of the ballet instead, Episodes I by Graham and Episodes II by Balanchine.[4][28] Initially, Graham was to choreograph on her dancers then teach the ballet to NYCB dancers.[26][25] However, after Balanchine attended a Graham rehearsal, they clashed over what she had choreographed, with many instances of dancers on their knees and floorwork. It was then decided that the two choreographers would primarily work with their respective companies, while at Kirstein's suggestion, incorporate each other's dancers in their halves.[a][26][32][30]
The project was officially announced in late March, as part of NYCB's spring season that year. Cecil Beaton was first announced to be the designer of Graham's costumes, but NYCB costumer Karinska ultimately ""designed and executed"" costumes for the entire ballet, as credited in the program.[33] David Hays designed the set and lighting.[2] The legal contract for the co-production, signed less than a month before the premiere, stated Ballet Society owned ""all rights to the use of the title"" and exclusive rights to Graham's choreography for three years.[5][34]
In the lead-up to the premiere, the ballet drew significant media attention and was described as ""historic"", due to contributions from leading choreographers of two different genres of dance. Walter Terry wrote in the New York Herald Tribune, ""whether it turns out to be a success or only a fascinating experiment is of historical significance."" The London-based Dance and Dancers reported, ""news of historical importance to the international dance field has been made.""[6][35]

Graham[edit]
Graham was first assigned the score Passacaglia, op. 1. To understand it, she stayed in her studio and ""played it and moved to it day after day after day"",[30] occasionally calling a principal dancer in for private work, before she began working with the full company.[36] She studied Stefan Zweig and Raymond Preston's biographies on Mary, and was inspired by two poets, T. S. Eliot, whose poem East Coker referenced Mary, and Rainer Maria Rilke, who was Webern's favorite poet. Graham said she ""found my articulation"" from the two.[30] Later, Graham realized she needed more music, so Balanchine gave her Six Pieces, op. 6, which he had already begun choreographing.[37]
Graham also starred as Mary, with a stand-in in rehearsals.[38] Early in the creation process, she expected an NYCB dancer to perform the role.[30] Four NYCB dancers appeared alongside the Graham company, including Sallie Wilson, who originated the role of Elizabeth I, as well Kenneth Peterson, Bill Carter and Paul Nickel, who had smaller roles in the ballet.[30] Graham did not want to partner an NYCB dancer and cast Bertram Ross as Bothwell.[39] Wilson recalled that in rehearsals, Graham would stop rehearsals and let everyone meditate. Graham also explained the symbols in the choreography, ""each thing was weighted carefully.""[38] Graham initially gave Wilson ballet steps, despite knowing little about them. Wilson then asked Graham to give her modern dance steps. Though Graham was glad about this request, she remained unsure whether Wilson could dance it, and other dancers assisted Wilson. She said the result of her dancing in the manner of Graham was ""marvelous."" She added that the Graham dancers ""were thrilled that I could actually move my back – they had expected a ramrod.""[38] Graham created two versions of choreography for Wilson, one performed in the ballet's initial run in spring 1959, which Wilson thought was ""less interesting"", and another performed later that year, described as ""much more in [Graham's] style, when she realized I could do more.""[38]
Previously, Graham only worked with her own dancers and followed her own schedule. However, for Episodes, she did not have ultimate control over all elements. Instead, she had to follow Balanchine's concept and the NYCB mode of working, where multiple choreographers share rehearsal schedules.[40] She also clashed with Kirstein numerous times, especially regarding the designs of the ballet. NYCB was under union regulations and all costumes and sets must be made under legal contracts and at union shops, but Graham attempted to circumvent this.[41] Graham was more cordial with Balanchine, and found him ""so wonderful to work with, considerate and concerned – a joy to be with.""[42]

Balanchine[edit]
Only one Graham dancer worked with Balanchine, Paul Taylor. Taylor had some background in ballet, as he regularly took classes taught by Cecchetti disciple Margaret Craske during the 1950s.[43] Kirstein, keen to work with Taylor, had previously invited Taylor to work on two projects, one as a choreographer and one as a dancer, but neither came into fruition.[44] Balanchine was suffering from arthritis, and had difficulties demonstrating the steps to Taylor.[17] Taylor, who originated a long solo, found Balanchine's process ""a complete switch"" from Graham, ""The speed and craft in which he works are astounding, the rehearsal time being used economically, none if it taken up by explanations of concepts, poetic imagery, or motivation.""[17] Taylor was used to dancing Graham's plot-driven choreography, and initially struggled with Balanchine's more abstract concept. He also found the musicality and movement vocabulary to be more challenging than Graham's choreography.[17][45] Fearing he would forget the complex choreography, Taylor would go home immediately after each rehearsal to draw stick figures and write notes for himself.[46]
Prior to giving Six Pieces, op. 6 to Graham, Balanchine had spent four days choreographing to the score as a pas de deux for Diana Adams and Jacques d'Amboise, and nearly completed the pas de deux when Graham asked for more music. According to d'Amboise, Balanchine's vision of the pas de deux was ""[a] version of first man and first woman,"" like Adam and Eve right after they ate the apple. Balanchine then made another pas de deux for Adams and d'Amboise, to Five Pieces, op. 10, and abandoned his original vision.[13][47]

Premiere and reception[edit]
Episodes premiered on May 14, 1959, at the City Center of Music and Dance, during NYCB's spring season. By popular demand, the season was extended for more performances of Episodes.[48][49]
Times noted, ""Vastly different in their approaches, both Balanchine and Graham were remarkably successful at illuminating Webern's sparse, mostly atonal scores—perhaps the world's unlikeliest music for dancing.""[50]
New York Times dance critic John Martin called the ballet ""a truly remarkable creation."" He commented on Graham's choreography, ""the invention is superb and uncannily revelatory."" As for Balanchine, Martin wrote, ""The style in which he worked is a miracle of creativeness, far beyond anything he has done previously.""[51]
In another review published at the end of Episodes first season, Martin wrote, ""What [Graham] has done is powerful, brilliant and well within the established conventions of her highly personal medium. Balanchine, on the other hand, has pushed his own equally characteristic approach into uncharted fields.""[52] Dance historian Angela Kane, however, found that some of the New York critics expressed their preference for Graham's contribution over Balanchine's.[53]

Subsequent performances[edit]
Graham's biographer Don McDonagh stated Graham soon lost interest in the ballet after the premiere.[36] The Graham company and NYCB performed Episodes together again during NYCB's 1959 winter season, which was the last time Episodes was performed in full.[48] Starting in 1960, the Balanchine choreography is presented as a standalone piece, at the time under the title Episodes II. Taylor appeared at the New York City Ballet for two more seasons as a guest artist to dance his solo. In 1961, Taylor's part in the ballet was removed. He was invited to join NYCB, but chose to focus on his choreographic career and his company instead.[54][55] Henceforth, the Balanchine ballet is presented as simply Episodes.[2] Other ballet companies that had performed Balanchine's Episodes include Dutch National Ballet, Scottish Ballet, Berlin Opera Ballet,[49] National Ballet of Canada,[56] Boston Ballet,[57] Miami City Ballet,[58] Suzanne Farrell Ballet and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens.[59][60]
NYCB had never danced Graham's choreography, though Kirstein did consider it as early as May 1959, potentially with Melissa Hayden taking over as Mary.[61][34] In 1965, Balanchine suggested Graham to have both companies revive both parts of the ballet for NYCB's fall season. She declined due to a scheduling conflict with her company, but she was open to such revival, ""I hope your invitation will stand and that it can still take place at a time when we are not burdened as at present.""[61] Balanchine wrote in his 1977 book Balanchine's Complete Stories of the Great Ballets, ""Miss Graham's part of Episodes has unfortunately not been seen for some years. It is our hope that one day it will be danced again.""[62] Kane speculated that the main reason why the complete Episodes co-production was never revived again was the ""choreographic contradictions between the two parts"", in addition to ""conflicting company politics, working practices and performance schedules.""[61]
In 1980, the Graham company revived her Episodes at the Metropolitan Opera House, with the choreography significantly revised.[10][11] Though the NYCB allowed Graham to use the original costumes by Karinska, her company used new costumes by Halston, while also using the original set by David Hays. This remains the only revival of Graham's Episodes.[10][61]

Paul Taylor's solo[edit]
After Taylor's solo was cut from the ballet in 1961, he offered to teach it to whomever Balanchine chose, though Balanchine never took up this offer.[55] It was not performed until 1986, three years after Balanchine's death, when Taylor reconstructed it for Peter Frame, then a soloist at the NYCB.[46][63] Taylor cast Frame after spotting him at a company class, which Taylor was invited to observe by co-ballet master in chief Peter Martins.[b][46] As Taylor's performance had never been filmed or notated, he relied on his notes and photographs to teach the solo to Frame.[46] Taylor removed knee works that would be dangerous to Frame's ballet-trained body.[15] Frame continued to perform the solo until 1989, a year before his retirement.[64]
In 2014, when the Miami City Ballet performed Episodes, Taylor's solo was included. Frame taught the solo to the company's dancers,[58][65] based on an archival video of him dancing the solo in 1989, though he did not let the dancers watch the video, and only showed them photographs of Taylor.[15] Jovani Furlan danced it on opening night.[58]
In 2020, NYCB performed the solo again.[15] It was alternated between Furlan, who had since joined NYCB, and Michael Trusnovec, a former Paul Taylor Dance Company member who performed as a guest artist. As both Taylor and Frame died in 2018, Furlan taught the solo to Trusnovec.[15] The two watched videos of Frame dancing the solo in both 1986 and 1989, and found significant differences on the choreography between the two videos. Believing that the 1986 version is closer to the original, they restored some steps back to the solo.[15] NYCB excluded the solo from the ballet again in 2022.[66]

Notes and references[edit]
Notes[edit]


^ There are conflicting accounts over whether Graham deliberately avoided working with NYCB dancers. Don McDonagh's biography stated that Graham raised her objection to the plan by using ""all of the virtuosic skills inherent in the Graham technique, which would be exceptionally difficult for a classically trained ballet dancer,"" that would be impossible for NYCB dancers to master in a short amount of time, forcing the plan to be abandoned.[29] However, another Graham biographer, Ernestine Stodelle, wrote an account of Graham shutting herself in her studio, listening to the music day after day, ""even though at the time she had no idea of dancing the role of the Scottish Queen with her company, believing one of the NYCB dancers would perform it.""[30] Kane was more persuaded by Stodelle's account, due to an interview Graham gave to The Ballet Annual 1960, and Kane's own interview with Hodes, that both confirmed that account. Kane additionally noted that Stodelle interviewed four dancers involved in the development of Episodes in addition to Graham, while McDonagh's only interviewee involved in the ballet was Graham.[31]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet by Cesare Pugni and Jules Perrot
La Esmeralda is a ballet in three acts and five scenes, inspired by the 1831 novel Notre-Dame de Paris by Victor Hugo, originally choreographed by Jules Perrot to music by Cesare Pugni, with sets by William Grieve and costumes by Mme. Copère.
It was first presented by the Ballet of her Majesty's Theatre, London on 9 March 1844, with Carlotta Grisi as Esmeralda, Jules Perrot as Gringoire, Arthur Saint-Leon as Phoebus, Adelaide Frassi as Fleur de Lys, and Antoine Louis Coulon as Quasimodo.
Today the complete ballet is performed only in Russia, Eastern Europe, and by two ballet companies in the United States.  The New Jersey Ballet introduced the full-length version for the first time in the United States in 2004, and the Russian Ballet Orlando performed La Esmeralda for the first time in 2021.[1] Most Western ballet companies only perform two Esmeralda-related pieces—La Esmeralda pas de deux and La Esmeralda pas de six—and the Diane and Actéon Pas de Deux, which is actually not excerpted from the ballet, but often mistakenly credited as having been added by Marius Petipa to his 1886 revival of La Esmeralda.[2] Variations from the ballet are still commonly performed by students at ballet competitions.[3][4]


Plot[edit]
Plot outline based on the full synopsis translated by Professor Roland John Wiley:[5]
The beautiful Romani girl Esmeralda marries the poet Pierre Gringoire, to save him from death in the hands of the Romani king. The groom is smitten with his new bride, but she makes it clear that the marriage is strictly one of convenience. Gringoire is not the only one infatuated with Esmeralda, the archdeacon of Notre Dame cathedral, Claude Frollo, is dangerously obsessed with the girl and orders his deformed henchman, Quasimodo, to abduct her. When Quasimodo attacks Esmeralda in the street, she is rescued by the King's Archers, led by their handsome captain Phoebus de Chateaupers, who capture Quasimodo. They plan to torture him, but Esmeralda asks for his release. The hunchback is deeply touched by her kindness. Phoebus is enchanted by the girl and gives her a scarf that was given to him by his fiancée, Fleur de Lys.
The next day, Fleur de Lys and her mother hold a grand celebration for her engagement to Phoebus, who is distracted by thoughts of Esmeralda. She arrives to entertain the guests, but is left heartbroken when she sees that Fleur de Lys' fiancé is none other than her beloved Phoebus. Fleur de Lys notices that Esmeralda is wearing the scarf that she gave to Phoebus and realising that he has fallen in love with another, angrily calls off the engagement. Phoebus leaves with Esmeralda. Alone in a tavern, the two declare their love for each other, unaware that the archdeacon Frollo is also there, eavesdropping on them. Taking a dagger that he stole from Esmeralda's room, Frollo sneaks up behind the lovers and stabs Phoebus, who falls unconscious to the ground. Frollo calls for the authorities, shows them the body of Phoebus and the dagger that was used to stab him, which is identified as Esmeralda's. The poor girl is taken away and sentenced to death.
At dawn the following morning, the Festival  of Fools is under way and Esmeralda is due to be hanged for the murder of Phoebus. Her friends and Gringoire are all present and bid her farewell, while Frollo watches in triumph. Just as Esmeralda is led to the gallows, Phoebus arrives alive and well, having survived and recovered from the stabbing. He reveals the true culprit to be Frollo and announces that Esmeralda is innocent of any crime. Frollo takes a dagger and attempts to do away with them, but Quasimodo wrests the dagger from his master and stabs him to death. Esmeralda and Phoebus are happily reunited.

Everywhere We GoChoreographerJustin PeckMusicSufjan StevensPremiereMay 8, 2014 (2014-05-08)David H. Koch TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignJanie TaylorKarl JensenBrandon Stirling Baker
Everywhere We Go is a ballet choreographed by Justin Peck and scored by Sufjan Stevens. The ballet is plotless, danced by a cast of 25 and features nine sections. This is the second collaboration between Peck and Stevens, following Year of the Rabbit (2012). Everywhere We Go was created for the New York City Ballet (NYCB), and premiered on May 8, 2014, at the David H. Koch Theater, during NYCB's spring gala. The success of the ballet led to Peck's appointment as resident choreographer of NYCB, as the second person to hold the position.[1][2]


Development[edit]
Choreographer Justin Peck (top) and composer Sufjan Stevens (bottom)
Choreographer Justin Peck and indie singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens first collaborated on Year of the Rabbit (2012), which is set to the latter's album Enjoy Your Rabbit, for the New York City Ballet. Stevens initially hated ballet, but Peck convinced him to watch various ballets and be educated on the art form. He ultimately agreed to let Peck use his album, and Year of the Rabbit received critical acclaim.[3] After Year of the Rabbit, Peck suggested to Stevens that they collaborate again, this time with original music. Stevens was initially hesitant as he rarely works with large organizations like the NYCB, and he was unsure whether he had any ideas, but he agreed to working on another ballet anyway.[3] This would be Peck's sixth piece for NYCB.[4] Peck and Stevens' attempted to have a conceptual conversation about the score would be,[3] though they ultimately decided to start working on the ballet without a concept. However, they decide to make the ballet plotless since Peck mainly choreographs abstract ballets.[5]
When composing, Stevens would upload sketches he wrote on the piano or guitar on a server for Peck,[6] with suggestions for the steps or which dancer perform that part, and Peck would develop the choreography from Stevens' ideas, then show it to him.[3] The two also had what Stevens called a ""veto system"", with Peck rejecting compositions he found not suitable.[5] Stevens said, ""A lot of the music is developed from repetition and rhythmic variation and counting—not just time signatures, but an emphasis on dynamics and accents. It’s not technically difficult, but lends itself to the athleticism and technicality of City Ballet.""[3] Peck also noted ""There has been a lot of dialogue back and forth about the structure of the dance, and what is happening during certain moments in the music.""[3] The score was arranged by Michael P. Atkinson.[7] Peck and Stevens went through the orchestration ""in a very meticulous way.""[3] Stevens conceived the title of the ballet and the subtitles for the nine sections, which Peck called ""placeholder"" titles for Stevens.[8] Comparing the process between songwriting and composing a ballet, Stevens found that in songwriting ""you just follow the muse, narrative, the melody, and this inherent story"", but ""writing for ballet is much more utilitarian, so I have a greater consideration for rhythm and movement and dynamic with very exact functions.""[5] Stevens called his experience on this ballet as ""kind of power pop and really, really dynamic and celebratory and unabashedly fun.""[9]
Janie Taylor was approached by Peck to design the costumes. Taylor, who retired as principal of NYCB in early 2014, often made her own leotards in classes.[10] She was supervised by Marc Happel, the head of NYCB's costume department.[8] When Taylor designed the costumes, she only heard the  music, and Peck provided ideas on he wanted the costumes look like. She only saw the choreography after the designs were complete.[10] The women are dressed in striped leotards, while the men are in black and grey attires, both with a red band at the waist.[1] She had the women wear dyed white pointe shoes, even though she knew that the dancers do not like them, and she personally felt the dyed shoes are harder than the typical pink ones.[10]
The decor is designed by architect and artist Karl Jensen, who had no prior experience with set design.[5] The set featured two muslin drops, dyed in three tones with patterned cutouts, and forms different patterns as the drops move up and down.[11] Brandon Stirling Baker, a frequent collaborator of Peck, designed the lighting.[11]
In April 2014, few weeks before the premiere of Everywhere We Go, the New York City Ballet released a short film of the ballet featuring Tiler Peck, Teresa Reichlen and Amar Ramasar. It was directed by Jody Lee Lipes, who worked with Peck on the documentary Ballet 422.[12] The same month, few excerpts and some of its designs were revealed at Work & Process at the Guggenheim.[13]

Choreography and music[edit]
The ballet contains nine sections:

The Shadows Will Fall Behind
Happiness Is a Perfume
I Breathe the Air of Mountains and Their Unapproachable Heights
To Live in the Hearts We Leave Behind
There Is Always the Sunshine
Every Flower That Stirs the Elastic Sod
I Am in the House and I Have the Key
The Gate of Heaven Is Love
Thanks to the Human Heart by Which We Live[8]
The ballet is danced by four principal women, three principal men, three demi-soloist couples, and a corps de ballet of six men and six women.[8] The ballet is plotless.[5] Dance critic Zoë Anderson called the ballet ""full of variety and changing moods."" She described ""Corps and soloists often overlap, with principals emerging from the group and merging back into it.""[1] She also noted, ""Everywhere We Go emphasises the ensemble, which will interrupt duets or spin its own complex patterns. The title suggests a sense of shared community, which also appears in how the dancers interact""[1]
For The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Ballet, Mindy Aloff wrote, ""Everywhere We Go is built on images of community, tribes, and group ritual, but it is cast with an attention to hierarchy,"" for its division between the principal dancers and the corps. Aloff noted one of the principal woman, often performed by a taller dancer, never partners with others and ""serves as a kind of muse or guiding ideal.""[8] Aloff found that ""Several sustained pas de deux present different kinds of relationships."" She also observed that ""The ballerinas, as in Balanchine's works, are given real technical challenges, from all parts of the classical lexicon.""[8]
Both Aloff and Anderson noted a motif in the ballet, which occurs twice, when the dancers are scattered on stage, they begin to fall, but other dancers catch them.[1][8] Peck explained this scene to Aloff, ""There is something shocking and jarring about seeing someone who is healthy have the life leave the body. You remember how fleeting life is and how fragile we are. This is a superhuman ballet, and I wanted to remind the audience that these are human beings—and they're all going to die. But no one hits the ground alone.""[8]
On the score, Pitchfork described ""it wasn’t just the instrumentation that sounded like Stevens. The same weird chord progressions that cast a theme of doomed hopefulness over Stevens' work, from his quiet folk songs to his grander, louder pieces, was present here. Just when things start to get dark in a Sufjan Stevens song, he’ll throw in a wink of humor to add some levity, in the form of an unusual sound or beat."" Like the choreography, there are also motifs in the score, such as ""A series of steady piano notes at the root of a song.""[6]

Original cast[edit]
The principal dancers in the original cast were:[1]

Maria Kowroski
Sterling Hyltin
Tiler Peck
Teresa Reichlen
Robert Fairchild
Andrew Veyette
Amar Ramasar
Performances[edit]
Everywhere We Go premiered on May 8, 2014, at the David H. Koch Theater,[1] during the company's spring gala, conducted by Michael P. Atkinson.[14]
The Australian Ballet debuted the ballet in September 2022.[15]

Critical reception[edit]
New York Times dance critic Alastair Macaulay commented, ""a work both diffuse and brilliant whose rich supply of configurations, phrases and rhythms often (if not always) suggests that young Mr. Peck can do anything he wants with choreography: a virtuoso of the form.""[14] For DanceTabs, Marina Harss wrote, ""Like Paz de la Jolla and Year of the Rabbit before it, Everwhere We Go is ingenious, imaginative, fast-paced, complex, densely packed. Peck has the mind of a mathematician; he finds ways to subdivide the stage and keep the eye continually guessing... The body is also subdivided in surprising ways... And he hears everything in the music, peeling away layers and showing sounds we might otherwise miss.""[4]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




FaçadeChoreographerFrederick AshtonMusicWilliam WaltonBased on Façade, an EntertainmentPremiere26 April 1931Cambridge Theatre, LondonDesignJohn Armstrong
Façade is a ballet by Frederick Ashton, to the music of William Walton; it is a balletic interpretation of items from Façade – an Entertainment (1923) by Walton and Edith Sitwell. The ballet was first given by the Camargo Society at the Cambridge Theatre, on 26 April 1931. It has been regularly revived and restaged all over the world.

Robert Helpmann and Margot Fonteyn in Façade

Background[edit]
In 1923 Façade – an Entertainment was first given in public. It consisted of poems by Edith Sitwell recited by the author over music composed for the purpose by William Walton, performed by an ensemble of six players. The work was regarded as avant-garde and caused some controversy.[1] In 1926 Walton arranged a suite of five of the numbers, omitting the spoken verses and expanding the orchestration. In 1929 the choreographer Günter Hess created a Façade ballet for the German Chamber Dance Theatre, using Walton's orchestral suite; Sitwell declined to allow her words to be used. Hess visited London in 1930 and is believed to have exchanged ideas with Ashton.[2]
Ashton's ballet was premiered by the Camargo Society, established the previous year to foster the work of British dancers and choreographers.[n 1] The work was set to the five items of Walton's suite, and orchestrations of two other numbers from the original entertainment, which are thought to have been made for the purpose by Constant Lambert, who conducted the premiere.[4]

Synopsis[edit]
Façade is a one-act ballet of seven to ten divertissements, described by the ballet critic Debra Crane as ""choreographic satires on popular dance forms and their dancers"".[5] There is no plot. The numbers as danced in the original production are:

Scotch Rhapsody
Jodelling Song
Polka
Valse
Popular Song
Tango-Pasodoble
Finale – Tarantella Sevillana.
Ashton revised the ballet over the years. ""Country Dance"" was added in 1935; ""Noche espagnola"" and ""Foxtrot"" in 1940.[6]

Original cast[edit]
Scotch Rhapsody –  Prudence Hyman, Maude Lloyd, Antony Tudor
Jodelling Song –  Lydia Lopokova (milkmaid); Frederick Ashton, William Chappell, Walter Gore (mountaineers)
Polka –  Alicia Markova
Valse –  Pearl Argyle, Diana Gould, Maude Lloyd, Prudence Hyman
Popular Song –  William Chappell, Walter Gore
Tango-Pasodoble –  Lydia Lopokova, Frederick Ashton
Finale–Tarantella Sevillana –  Lydia Lopokova, Frederick Ashton and ensemble
Source: Ashton Archive.[7]
Critical reception[edit]
The Times commented that the piece admirably translated the spirit of the original poems, but warned, ""If the Ballet is going to laugh at itself so freely, it must take care in future that we do not laugh at it in the wrong place."" The paper did not consider Façade the highlight of the quintuple bill in which it appeared: that honour went to ""Mme Karsavina's Valse Fantasie with music by Glinka"".[8] The Manchester Guardian also rated Karsavina's dance as the best thing in the evening, but praised the wit of Ashton's ballet, and singled out Lopokova for the subtlety of her comic performance.[3][n 2]
Reviewing a 2005 production by Scottish Ballet, The Times called Ashton's ballet a masterpiece, and The Guardian commented, ""The big treat is the company's acquisition of Frederick Ashton's Façade, a perennial audience favourite. This frothy Bright Young Things frolic, dating from 1931, captures the high spirits of the Brideshead world in sparklingly playful comedic vignettes.""[9]

Revivals[edit]
The ballet was revived in 1932 at the Savoy Theatre.[10] For a new production by the Vic-Wells Ballet in 1935, Ashton added the Country Dance. Among those appearing in this production were Margot Fonteyn and Robert Helpmann.[7] Ashton further expanded the work in 1940, adding the Foxtrot (""Old Sir Faulk"") and the Noche espagnola (""Nocturne péruvienne""). The three later additions were sometimes included and sometimes omitted from the Sadler's Wells (later the Royal Ballet) revivals in 1946, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1956 and 1958–9.[7]
In 1972 Ashton prepared a production for the Aldeburgh Festival using the original chamber score with Sitwell's verses recited by Peter Pears. This production was later seen in London, at Sadler's Wells Theatre.[6][n 3]
Among the revivals of Ashton's ballet have been those by the Borovansky Ballet (1946), New Zealand Ballet (1960), PACT Ballet (South Africa, 1966), Joffrey Ballet (1969), Australian Ballet (1972), Chicago Ballet (1975), Houston Ballet (1978), Washington Ballet (1983), Royal Winnipeg Ballet (1984), Ballet of the Teatro Regio, Turin (1992) and Scottish Ballet (2005).[7]

Notes and references[edit]
Notes


^ There were four other items in the programme, two of which were by Ashton (Mars and Venus and ""Follow Your Saint"": The Passionate Pavane), one by Tamara Karsavina, and one by Ninette de Valois – La création du monde.[3]

^ Karsavina was partnered by Ashton, whose dancing both The Times and The Manchester Guardian singled out for particular praise.

^ This was part of a seventieth birthday tribute to Walton arranged by Benjamin Britten and Pears. For the same event Ashton created a new ballet from Walton's Siesta. When Walton had first adapted the music of the original Façade entertainment into full orchestral versions in the 1920s and 30s, he partly rewrote and expanded some numbers, notably the Tarantella, doubled in length. Using the original Sitwell/Walton text required Ashton to rechoreograph accordingly to fit the reduced length of the music.[11]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Nora Kaye in Fall River Legend (1948)
Fall River Legend is a ballet by American choreographer Agnes de Mille, with music by Morton Gould. Set in Massachusetts in 1892-1893, the ballet tells the infamous story of Lizzie Borden. The work notably alters the outcome of the court case, with Borden receiving a guilty verdict rather than an acquittal. De Mille herself believed that Borden was guilty of the murder of her father and stepmother.[1]  Like the majority of de Mille’s ballets, Fall River Legend is deeply character driven.[2]  The ballet was commissioned by American Ballet Theatre and premiered on April 22, 1948 at the Metropolitan Opera House. Today, Fall River Legend is considered by many scholars to be her masterpiece and when it first premiered, the reviews of the ballet were generally positive.[3]


Conception[edit]
The playwright Edward Sheldon encouraged de Mille to use the Lizzie Borden story for a dance, following the success of her 1942 ballet Rodeo. However, the creative development of the ballet was stalled by de Mille’s marriage to Walter Prude, the birth of their son Jonathan, and de Mille’s work on Broadway. Still, the idea remained on de Mille’s mind and on her honeymoon she brought a copy of Edmund Pearson’s The Trial of Lizzie Borden.[4]
The score of the ballet was composed by Morton Gould and featured sets by Oliver Smith. De Mille worked closely with Gould to create Fall River Legend and the decision to end the ballet with a guilty verdict was one they came to together. In a later interview between composer and choreographer, they recall that they came to this decision at the famous Russian Tea Room.[5] Gould claimed that he could not write ""acquittal music"" and thus suggested the alternate ending.[6] He also quipped that ""changing history is called poetic license.""[7]
To provide context for the narrative, the ballet opens with a “true bill,” delivering the guilty verdict. For de Mille, the legal terminology helped to establish the dramatic mood of the ballet. De Mille describes how this choice, “… would get over the exposition quickly and reveal that our heroine was in a very nasty predicament.”[8] De Mille made the decision not to show any violence on stage throughout the ballet, as she believed that violence on stage was “nearly always silly.”[9] Early in the ballet, a younger version of “The Accused” dances in a dream sequence with her mother, while the adult version of the character looks on. De Mille also added a love story to her ballet, between The Accused and the Pastor. In one affectionate pas de deux, the Pastor and the Accused dance together, with the music echoing that of a previous dance between the Mother and Father characters.[10]

Productions[edit]
The original cast of Fall River Legend included:



Diana Adams
""Mother""


Alicia Alonso
""The Accused""


Muriel Bentley
""Stepmother""


Peter Gladke
""Father""


Ruth Ann Koesun
""The Accused as a Child""


John Kriza
""Pastor""

A March 24, 1957 episode of Omnibus presented a production of the ballet with Nora Kaye as ""The Accused"".
More recent performances of Fall River Legend include a production by the Dance Theatre of Harlem in 1989. This production, commercially available for viewing, features current Dance Theatre of Harlem artistic director Virginia Johnson in the role of “The Accused.”[11] American Ballet Theatre performed the ballet in 1999 and again in 2007, most recently featuring ballerinas Julie Kent and Gillian Murphy as ""The Accused"".[12]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


1944 ballet by Leonard Bernstein


Kansas City Ballet in Fancy Free
Fancy Free is a ballet composed in 1944 by Leonard Bernstein. The Ballet Theatre premiered the ballet with choreography by Jerome Robbins, scenery by Oliver Smith, costumes by Kermit Love, and lighting by Ronald Bates. The premiere took place on Tuesday, 18 April 1944 at the old Metropolitan Opera House, New York. The New York City Ballet premiere took place on Thursday, 31 January 1980. Fancy Free provided the basis for the later musical, On the Town. A portion of the score was also used in the opening scenes of Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window.[citation needed]


Synopsis[edit]
The scene is a bar and the outside sidewalk in New York City, in wartime. Three sailors on liberty boisterously arrive, have a drink (two of their number conning the third into paying), and head outside looking for female companionship. A beautiful girl passes by and the three sailors vie for her attention. She demurs and escapes, pursued by two of the sailors. The Third, having been left in the dust, encounters another beautiful passer-by, and invites her to have a drink with him. He impresses her with a pantomime of his military exploits, and they dance a passionate pas de deux.
The other two sailors arrive with the first girl, who recognizes the second girl as a friend. The sailors realize their predicament: three men, but only two girls. The couples dance and change partners, with one always left dancing alone. Finally, it is decided that the three sailors will hold a contest and the loser will go dateless. Each sailor performs a solo variation (a galop, a waltz, and a danzon), but they're so equally matched that the girls can't decide and the boys come to blows. In the midst of the fistfight, the girls flee in terror. Seeing their dates vanish, the sailors pick themselves up, have another drink and head outside again. Another beautiful girl passes by, and the three sailors take off in hot pursuit.

Musical inspiration[edit]
A small portion of Fancy Free was apparently recycled from ""Riobamba"", a theme song Bernstein had written for a short-lived New York City nightclub of the same name.[1]

Fancy Free (1946 album)[edit]
Fancy FreeSoundtrack album by Leonard BernsteinReleased1946RecordedJune 2, 1944, & March 13, 1946GenreBallet / JazzLabelDecca Records  Decca DA-406
In 1946, Decca Records released an album of the score for Fancy Free (Decca DA-406), conducted by  Leonard Bernstein. Issued before the introduction of the LP, it was initially released in 78rpm album format, in which four 78rpm records were bound together in a photo album style book, with a booklet included. Each of the seven movements of the ballet, plus the introductory vocal number Big Stuff, comprised one side of a 78. The sides were sequenced with the last number backing the first, the second-last the second, and so on, so that all four discs could be stacked and played in sequence, then flipped en masse to complete the album.[2] The album was rereleased in 1953 in the new 10"" LP format (DL 6023).
The music was recorded by the Ballet Theatre Orchestra on June 2, 1944, and conducted by Bernstein himself, except for the song Big Stuff. Big Stuff was performed by Billie Holiday, who was also signed to Decca, along with a band composed of Joe Guy (trumpet), Joe Springer (piano), Tiny Grimes (guitar), Billy Taylor (bass), and Kelly Martin (drums).[3] Bernstein had composed the song with Holiday in mind, to be played as a recording in the theatre before the ballet proper began. He knew Holiday from her Cafe Society days, but at the beginning of his career did not believe he was in a position to have her record his song, so originally in 1944 the song heard in the ballet was a recording made by his own sister, Shirley. But Holiday heard and liked the tune, and recorded it several times, with this recording made March 13, 1946.[4]

FanfareChoreographerJerome RobbinsMusicBenjamin BrittenPremiereJune 2, 1953 (1953-06-02)City Center of Music and DramaOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletGenreNeoclassical ballet
Fanfare is a one-act ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to Benjamin Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, in celebration of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. The ballet premiered on June 2, 1953, the night of the coronation, at the City Center of Music and Drama, danced by the New York City Ballet.[1]


Structure[edit]
The ballet starts with a majordomo on stage reading Britten's explanatory text from the score, then proceeds to an ensemble performance with dancers representing different instruments,[2] including three women as a piccolo and two flutes, a woman as the oboe, a man and a woman as the clarinets, two men as the bassoons, a man and a woman as the violas,[3] three women as the cellos, a man as the double bass, a woman as the harp,[4] two men as trumpets, four men as a tuba and three trombones[5] and three men as the percussion instruments.[4] There are no major solos in the ballet.[1]

Production[edit]
According to Deborah Jowitt's biography of Jerome Robbins, it is believed that George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, both New York City Ballet co-founders and Anglophiles, requested Robbins to create a new ballet on the occasion of the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.[6] Balanchine wanted to contribute to the ballet. When Robbins was unavailable, he requested Balanchine to lead a rehearsal, but Balanchine added his touch to the choreography, which Robbins reversed once he found out. Balanchine would say ""I fixed, but you changed"" to Robbins whenever Fanfare was revived.[7]
The ballet is set to Britten's The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra, which is based on a theme by Henry Purcell and was commissioned for the 1946 BBC documentary, Instruments of the Orchestra.[1][2][5] At the premiere, the costumes and set were uncredited,[1] though Irene Sharaff was later credited.[4][8]

Performances[edit]
The program on which Fanfare had its premiere, which was also the day of the coronation, was curated by Kirstein to honor British choreographers, composers and designers, though Robbins was born in Manhattan.[2] It started with an address made by Major-General William Dimoline of the British Army. Then, Walton's Orb and Sceptre, which was used at the coronation earlier, was performed by the orchestra. Following performances of two ballets by choreographer Frederick Ashton and Swan Lake, Fanfare had its premiere.[1]
The New York City Ballet revives Fanfare infrequently, and the ballet was absent from the repertory between 1978 and 1987.[3] Fanfare was included in the 2008 Jerome Robbins Celebration program,[9] then was absent from the repertory again until the Robbins centenary program in the 2017/18 season.[10] Actors who have been the majordomo include Eric Swanson,[3] David Jaffe,[4] Bill Nolte,[5] David Lowenstein,[11] and David Aaron Baker.[12] In 2020, in response to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, the New York City Ballet released a video excerpt of the ballet.[13][14]
The School of American Ballet, the affiliated school of the New York City Ballet, have included Fanfare in their annual workshop performances.[15][16] Robbins staged Fanfare for the Royal Danish Ballet in 1956.[8] The Pacific Northwest Ballet have also performed the ballet with minor changes.[17]

Marie Taglioni in her brother Paul Taglioni's ballet Satanella oder Metamorphosen
Faust ballets are a set of ballets, choreographed between the 18th and 20th centuries, based on the legend of Faust. As early as 1723, London-based John Rich put on a Faust-inspired ballet pantomime called The Necromancer at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. In the 19th century several productions took Faust as their subject matter including August Bournonville's 1832 production Faust for the Royal Danish Ballet.[1]
In 1833, Andre Deshayes' Faust premiered in London with music by Adolphe Adam.[2]
On 12 February 1848, a Faust ballet premiered at the Ballet of the Teatro alla Scala in Milan. This version featured choreography and libretto by Jules Perrot and music by Giacomo Panizza, Michael Andrew Costa, and Niccolò Bajetti, with Fanny Elssler (as Marguerite), Perrot (as Mephistophelis), Effisio Catte (as Faust), and Ekaterina Costantini (as Bambo, Queen of the Demons). Perrot revived the ballet three times between 1848 and 1854, the last featuring a revised score by Cesare Pugni. In 1867, Marius Petipa revived this version again for the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, St. Petersburg, using the revised Pugni score.
In 1852 Paul Taglioni, brother of Maria Taglioni (the first ballerina to dance en pointe), choreographed Satanella oder Metamorphosen with music by composed by Peter Ludwig Hertel. A few years later, Julius Reisinger's Mephistophelia premiered in Hamburg and Meyer Lutz composed the score for Joseph Lanner's 1895 production.[3]
The trend continued into the 20th century with ballets created by Remislav Remislavsky, Heiner Luipart and female choreographer Nina Kirsanova based on an unstaged 19th century libretto Der Doktor Faust, written by Heinrich Heine. Romantic composer Berlioz's La Damnation de Faust was staged by French choreographer Maurice Béjart for the Paris Opera Ballet in 1964). Béjart's 1975 production Notre Faust was set to Bach's B minor Mass.[1] Béjart himself danced in Notre Faust at its New York City premiere in 1977.[4]

Marfa Muravieva in the Saint-Léon/Minkus Fiametta, Paris, 1864
Fiametta or Fiammetta, (also known as The Flame of Love, The Salamander or Néméa) is a  ballet in four acts and four scenes, choreographed by Arthur Saint-Léon to music by Ludwig Minkus, first presented by the Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre on November 12–24, 1863 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates) at the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow, Russia, with Anna Sobeshchanskaya as Fiametta.[citation needed]


Plot[edit]
Fiametta is a fantastic creature, produced by Cupid from the flame of love, who took the form of an earthly girl in order to charm Count Sterngold and prevent him from marrying a rich bride Regonda for self-interest. Cupid, with the help of Fiametta, reunites Regonda and officer Otto, who love each other.
The action, which began on Olympus, was transferred to Tyrol. In an eclectic plot, a magical creature, mythological heroes, Tyrolean aristocrats and gypsies coexisted - the presence on the stage of fantastic as well as real characters from different layers of society allowed the choreographer to use both classical and characteristic dance. The reviewer Bocharov noted that the author “quite managed to reconcile the graceful pride of Greek mythological creatures with the un-ceremoniousness of some Tyrolean Count and the violent revelry of idle gypsies” (a few years later, a similar combination is used by Marius Petipa in his ballet Don Quixote).

Characters[edit]
Cupid, god of love
Fiametta
Mercury
Terpsichore
Coquetry
Count Friedrich Sterngold
Ritter, his friend
Molari, tutor and guardian of the Count
Martini, servant of the count
Princess Milfleur
Regonda, her daughter
Yolanda and Margarita, friends of Regonda
Otto, officer
Three graces, nymphs, cupids, muses, gypsies, Tyrolean villagers and villagers
Synopsis[edit]
Prologue[edit]
Scene I
The goddesses of Olympus worship Cupid. Terpsichore, nymphs and other mythological creatures entertain the inhabitants of Olympus with dances. Mercury appears. He informs Cupid that a young man has appeared on earth, denying his power. Having squandered his fortune, he intends to marry a rich heiress who is in love with a brave officer and these lovers cry to the god of love, hoping for his protection.
Cupid offers a view of Regonda and Otto on one side and a pavilion with the inscription ""Temple closed to love"", where he has fun, drinking wine and playing cards with friends, surrounded by gypsies, Count Sterngold - on the other.
Cupid decides to punish the dissolute count and help the lovers. Having extinguished the altar with the flame of love, he reproduces Fiametta: endowed with magical beauty, she must take revenge on Sterngold for insulting Cupid.

Act 1[edit]
Scene II
Sterngold estate in Tyrol. The count is still having fun in the pavilion. A shot is fired, followed by Cupid in the guise of a hunter. Young people and gypsies persuade him to join their company. Cupid brings Fiametta in the guise of a gypsy. When she starts dancing, she charms Sterngold.

Revivals[edit]
Lithograph of rehearsals at the Paris Opera of the Saint-Léon/Minkus Fiametta, Paris, 1864
Restaging by Arthur Saint-Léon under the title Fiametta or The Devil In Love for the Imperial Ballet, with Minkus revising his score, first presented on February 13–25, 1864 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, St. Petersburg, Russia. Principal Dancers: Marfa Muravieva (as Fiametta), Lev Ivanov (as Count Friedrich), Vera Lyadova (as Cupid), Aleksandra Kemmerer (as Regonda), Christian Johansson (as Otto), and Maria Sokolova (as Terpsichore). Other interpreters of Fiametta were Praskovia Lebedeva, Mathilde Madaeva, Adèle Grantzow (November 15–27, 1865). Saint-Léon's 1864 staging of this work was the first Russian production of a ballet to make use of such stage devices as electric lighting and shadow effects with the aid of convex mirrors.[a]
Restaging by Arthur Saint-Léon under the title Néméa ou l'Amour Vengé (Nemea or The Avenged Love) in two acts and four scenes for the Ballet of the Académie Royale de Musique, with Minkus revising his score, first presented on July 11, 1864, at the Académie Royale de Musique in Paris. For this production Saint-Léon changed the name of the names of the principal characters of Fiametta and Count Friedrich to Néméa and Count Molder. Principal Dancers: Marfa Muravieva (as Néméa), Eugénie Fiorcre (as Cupid), Louis Mérante (as Count Molder).
Restaging by Arthur Saint-Léon under the title Fiamma d'amore for Teatro Comunale di Trieste, with Giuseppe Camorano revising Minkus' score, first presented on March 15, 1868, in Trieste. Principal Dancers: Adèle Grantzow (as Fiametta).
Revival by Marius Petipa under the title Fiametta for the Imperial Ballet in four acts, first presented on December 6–18, 1887 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, Russia. Principal Dancers: Elena Cornalba (as Fiametta), Alexandre Shiryaev (as Cupid), and Pavel Gerdt (as Count Fiedrich).

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


La Fille de marbre is a ballet-pantomime in 2 acts by Arthur Saint-Léon, with music by Cesare Pugni, premiered on 20 October 1847 at the Opéra de Paris.
The main roles were held by Fanny Cerrito and Arthur Saint-Léon, who were making their debut at the Opéra de Paris. The ballet master Germain Quériau was also part of the cast.
Théophile Gautier, an uncompromising critic, raised many improbabilities that did not prevent the public to give a triumphant welcome to the couple who would become famous.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


La Fin du jour is a one-act ballet created by Kenneth MacMillan in 1979 for the Royal Ballet, London. The music is Maurice Ravel's Piano Concerto in G (1931).
In MacMillan's words, ""La Fin du jour draws its inspiration from the style of the 'thirties'; the designs and choreography are inspired by the fashion plates of an era and a way of life shattered forever by the Second World War.""
The first performance was at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 15 March 1979. The leading roles were danced by Merle Park, Jennifer Penney, Julian Hosking and Wayne Eagling. The solo pianist was Philip Gammon, the conductor was Ashley Lawrence, and the designs were by Ian Spurling.[1]

1910 ballet by Igor Stravinsky
This article is about the ballet to Stravinsky's 1910 music. For other uses of the word, see Firebird.

The Firebird (French: L'Oiseau de feu; Russian: Жар-птица, romanized: Zhar-ptitsa) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1910 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Michel Fokine, who collaborated with Alexandre Benois and others on a scenario based on the Russian fairy tales of the Firebird and the blessing and curse it possesses for its owner. It was first performed at the Opéra de Paris on 25 June 1910 and was an immediate success, catapulting Stravinsky to international fame and leading to future Diaghilev–Stravinsky collaborations including Petrushka (1911) and The Rite of Spring (1913).  
The Firebird's mortal and supernatural elements are distinguished with a system of leitmotifs placed in the harmony dubbed ""leit-harmony"". Stravinsky intentionally used many specialist techniques in the orchestra, including ponticello, col legno, flautando, glissando, and flutter-tonguing. Set in the evil immortal Koschei's castle, the ballet follows Prince Ivan, who battles Koschei with the help of the magical Firebird.
Stravinsky later created three concert suites based on the work: in 1911, ending with the ""Infernal Dance""; in 1919, which remains the most popular today; and in 1945, featuring significant reorchestration and structural changes. Other choreographers have staged the work with Fokine's original choreography or created entirely new productions using the music, some with new settings or themes. Many recordings of the suites have been made; the first was released in 1928, using the 1911 suite. A film version of the popular Sadler's Wells Ballet production, which revived Fokine's original choreography, was produced in 1959.


History[edit]
Background[edit]
Igor Stravinsky, c. 1920s
Igor Stravinsky began studying composition with Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1902.[1][2] He completed several works during his time as a student,[3] including his first performed work, Pastorale (1907),[4] and his first published work, the Symphony in E-flat (1907), which the composer categorized Opus 1.[3][5] In February 1909, a performance of his Scherzo fantastique and Feu d'artifice in Saint Petersburg was attended by the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who was intrigued by the vividness of Stravinsky's works.[6][7]
Diaghilev founded the art magazine Mir iskusstva in 1898,[8] but after it ended publication in 1904, he turned towards Paris for artistic opportunities rather than his native Russia.[6][9] In 1907, Diaghilev presented a five-concert series of Russian music at the Paris Opera; the next year, he staged the Paris premiere of Rimsky-Korsakov's version of Boris Godunov.[6][10][11] By 1909, Diaghilev had connected with Michel Fokine, Léon Bakst, and Alexandre Benois, and gained enough money to start his independent ballet company, the Ballets Russes.[6][12][13] Diaghilev commissioned Stravinsky to orchestrate music by Chopin for the ballet Les Sylphides, and the composer was finished by March 1909.[6][14]
Fokine was a renowned dancer, receiving first prize in his class upon graduation from the Imperial Theatre School in 1898; he subsequently entered the Mariinsky Ballet as a soloist and was promoted to lead dancer of the company in 1904.[15][16] Fokine was dissatisfied with the ballet tradition of glamorous appeals to the audience and interruptions from viewers; he felt that dramatic dance should be strictly displayed with no interruption of illusion, and that the music should be closely connected to the theme.[17][16] His 1907 ballets The Dying Swan and Les Sylphides were very successful and established Fokine as a competitor to other prominent choreographers.[18] In 1908, Benois, a member of Diaghilev's Mir iskusstva circle and friend of Fokine's, arranged for the dancer to prepare a repertoire for the Ballets Russes' 1909 season as the company's first lead choreographer;[18] the season was very successful, and Diaghilev began organizing plans for the 1910 season soon after.[19]

Conception[edit]
As the Ballets Russes faced financial issues, Diaghilev wanted a new ballet with distinctly Russian music[a] and design, something that had recently become popular with French and other Western audiences.[21][22] Fokine unofficially led a committee of artists to devise the scenario of this new ballet, including himself, Benois, the composer Nikolai Tcherepnin, and the painter Aleksandr Golovin.[23] Benois recalled that Pyotr Petrovich Potyomkin, a poet and ballet enthusiast in Diaghilev's circle, proposed the subject of the Firebird to the artists, citing the 1844 poem ""A Winter's Journey"" by Yakov Polonsky that includes the lines:[24]


And in my dreams I see myself on a wolf's back
Riding along a forest path
To do battle with a sorcerer-tsar
In that land where a princess sits under lock and key,
Pining behind massive walls.
There gardens surround a palace all of glass;
There Firebirds sing by night
And peck at golden fruit.[25]


Sketch of scenery for The Firebird by Aleksandr Golovin, who designed the sets and co-designed costumes with Léon Bakst for the premiere[26][27]
The committee drew from several books of Russian fairy tales, in particular Alexander Afanasyev's collection and Pyotr Pavlovich Yershov's The Little Humpbacked Horse.[23][28] The immortal king Koschei[b] and the captive Princess were incorporated from a Muscovite anthology of stories, which also helped determine the Firebird's role in the story.[29] Fokine drew on the stark contrast between good and evil in Russian fairy tales while developing the ballet's characters.[30][31] The choreographer blended fantasy and reality to create the scenario, a trope of romanticism found in many of Fokine's folkish ballets.[32] Originally, Tcherepnin was to compose the music, as he had previously worked on Le Pavillon d'Armide with Fokine and Benois, but he withdrew from the project.[33][34][35] In September 1909, Diaghilev asked Anatoly Lyadov to compose the ballet; Lyadov expressed interest in the production, but took too long to meet the 1910 season's deadline.[34][36][37] After considering Alexander Glazunov and Nikolay Sokolov, Diaghilev asked Stravinsky to compose the score upon encouragement from Tcherepnin and Boris Asafyev.[38][39]
Stravinsky began work in October or November 1909, traveling to the Rimsky-Korsakov household with Andrey Rimsky-Korsakov, the son of Stravinsky's teacher and dedicatee of The Firebird's score. Because Stravinsky began work before Diaghilev officially commissioned him,[40] the composer's sketches did not align with the scenario; the full story became known to him when he met with Fokine in December and received the ballet's planned structure.[41][42][43] Fokine ensured the creation of the ballet was an equal effort between the producers and the composer, working closely with Stravinsky while developing the choreography.[20] While the composer worked, Diaghilev organized private performances of the piano score for the press. The French critic Robert Brussel, a friend of Diaghilev's, wrote: ""By the end of the first scene, I was conquered: by the last, I was lost in admiration. The manuscript on the music-rest, scored over with fine pencillings, revealed a masterpiece.""[44]

Development[edit]
Tamara Karsavina as the Firebird and Michel Fokine as Prince Ivan in the 1910 Ballets Russes production
Despite later lamenting the ""descriptive music of a kind I did not want to write"", Stravinsky finished The Firebird in about six months, and had it fully orchestrated by mid-May 1910.[45][34] Stravinsky arrived in Paris around the beginning of June to attend the premiere of his first stage work; it was his first visit to Paris.[46][47][48]
Rehearsals began in Ekaterininsky Hall, and Stravinsky attended every rehearsal to help with the music, often explaining the complicated rhythms to the dancers.[49] Tamara Karsavina, who originated the titular Firebird role, later recalled, ""Often he came early to the theatre before a rehearsal began in order to play for me over and over again some particularly difficult passage.""[50] Stravinsky also worked closely with Gabriel Pierné, who conducted the premiere with the Colonne Orchestra,[51] to ""explain the music ... [but the musicians] found it no less bewildering than did the dancers"". Two dress rehearsals were held to accommodate the dancers, many of whom missed their entrances due to the unexpected changes in the music, ""which sounded quite different when played by the orchestra from what it had sounded like when played on a piano"".[52]
When the company arrived in Paris, the ballet was not finished, causing Fokine to extend rehearsals;[53] he petitioned Diaghilev to postpone the premiere, but the impresario declined, fearing public disappointment.[54] The Ballets Russes season began on 4 June 1910 with stagings of Schumann's Carnaval, Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade, and short productions from the previous season.[46]
Fokine's style of dance made great use of interpretive movement; he used ideas of expressiveness, naturalism, vitality, and stylistic consistency.[55] The choreographer employed many forms of dance in The Firebird. The titular Firebird danced classically, Koschei and his subjects in a more violent and grotesque manner, and the Princesses in a looser, gentler way.[31][56] The role of the Firebird differed from that of traditional ballerinas; female dancers often danced princesses, swans, and lovers, but the Firebird was a mysterious and abstract idea, represented as a magical force rather than a person. Her choreography featured exaggerated classical steps, with deep bending at the waist;[57] Fokine wanted her to be ""powerful, hard to manage, and rebellious"" rather than graceful.[58] This new kind of role for a female character was revolutionary for the ballet scene.[57]

Premiere and reception[edit]
Program notes for the Ballets Russes' 1910 season, showing The Firebird in the second column
Excitement for the premiere was great, particularly in Diaghilev's circle of Mir iskusstva collaborators.[27] The sculptor Dmitri Stelletsky [fr],[52] who helped develop the scenario,[59] wrote to Golovin on 16 June, ""I'm staying till Sunday; I must see The Firebird. I have seen your dazzling drawings and costumes. I like Stravinsky's music in the orchestra and the dances tremendously. I think the whole thing together with your sets will look spectacular. Serov has also put off his departure because of this ballet"".[27][52] Diaghilev remarked of Stravinsky during rehearsals, ""Mark him well, he is a man on the eve of celebrity"".[48]
The Firebird premiered at the Palais Garnier on 25 June 1910, and was very well-received.[27][48][60] The cast starred Karsavina as the Firebird, Fokine as Prince Ivan, Vera Fokina [fr] as the youngest princess, and Alexis Bulgakov as Koschei.[61] Karsavina later told an interviewer, ""With every performance, success went crescendo"".[62] Critics praised the ballet for the unity of the decor, choreography, and music.[63] ""The old-gold vermiculation of the fantastic back-cloth seems to have been invented to a formula identical with that of the shimmering web of the orchestra"", wrote Henri Ghéon in Nouvelle revue française; he called the ballet ""the most exquisite marvel of equilibrium"" and added that Stravinsky was a ""delicious musician"".[64][65] Fokine's choreography was seen as a triumph of his creative genius; the natural miming and many styles of dance displayed were popular with audiences.[53]
Many critics praised Stravinsky's alignment with Russian nationalist music, one saying, ""[Stravinsky is] the only one who has achieved more than mere attempts to promote Russia's true musical spirit and style"".[65] Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi hailed the young composer as the legitimate heir to The Mighty Handful.[66] Russian audiences viewed the work less favorably, and the Russian premiere was not well-received; according to a reviewer in Apollon, ""Many deserted the Hall of Nobles during the performance of this suite.""[67] A fellow Rimsky-Korsakov pupil, Jāzeps Vītols, wrote that ""Stravinsky, it seems, has forgotten the concept of pleasure in sound... [His] dissonances unfortunately quickly become wearying, because there are no ideas hidden behind them"".[68] Nikolai Myaskovsky reviewed the piano reduction of the full ballet in October 1911 and wrote, ""What a wealth of invention, how much intelligence, temperament, talent, what a remarkable, what a rare piece of work this is"".[69]
Stravinsky recalled that after the premiere and subsequent performances, he met many figures in the Paris art scene, including Marcel Proust, Sarah Bernhardt, Jean Cocteau, Maurice Ravel, André Gide, and Princesse Edmond de Polignac. Claude Debussy was brought on stage after the premiere, and he invited Stravinsky to dinner, beginning a lifelong friendship between the two composers.[48][70] According to Sergei Bertensson, Sergei Rachmaninoff said of the music: ""Great God! What a work of genius this is! This is true Russia!""[71] Debussy later said of Stravinsky's score, ""What do you expect? One has to start somewhere.""[72] Richard Strauss told the composer in private that he had made a ""mistake"" in beginning the piece pianissimo instead of astonishing the public with a ""sudden crash"". Shortly after he summed up to the press his experience of hearing The Firebird for the first time by saying, ""it's always interesting to hear one's imitators"".[73] Sergei Prokofiev, who first heard the piano reduction at a gathering, told Stravinsky, ""there was no music in [the ballet's introduction] and if there was any, it was from Sadko"".[74]
In his 1962 autobiography, Stravinsky credited much of the production's success to Golovin's set and Diaghilev's collaborators;[70] he wrote that Fokine's choreography ""always seemed to me to be complicated and overburdened with plastic detail, so that the artists felt, and still feel now, great difficulty in co-ordinating their steps and gestures with the music"".[75] The ballet's success secured Stravinsky's position as Diaghilev's star composer, and there were immediate talks of a sequel, leading to the composition of Petrushka and The Rite of Spring.[76][77]

Subsequent productions[edit]
After the success of the premiere, Diaghilev announced an expansion of performances until 7 July 1910, the last of which Stravinsky took his family to from their home in Ustilug. Andrey Rimsky-Korsakov quickly traveled to Paris to see the expanded run, and he later praised the production in a letter to his mother.[65] Following the initial run, Alexander Siloti conducted the Russian premiere on 23 October, performing an early draft of the 1911 suite.[67]Valentina Blinova in the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo 1935 productionThe debut London season of the Ballets Russes took place in 1912 at the Royal Opera House. The third ballet on the program was The Firebird, which was well-received. Osbert Sitwell wrote: ""Never until that evening had I heard Stravinsky's name; but as the ballet developed, it was impossible to mistake the genius of the composer, or of the artist who had designed the setting.""[78] The Ballets Russes revived the production in 1926 with new settings and costumes by Natalia Goncharova, using Fokine's original choreography. The revival was presented at the Lyceum Theatre in London.[79][80][81] In 1916, the first productions of The Firebird and Petrushka on the Iberian peninsula took place; the Ballets Russes returned in 1921 for short season in Madrid.[82] Several companies presented their own choreographies and designs of The Firebird from 1927 to 1933, including the Berlin State Opera, the Royal Swedish Ballet, the Royal Danish Ballet, and the Croatian National Theatre in Zagreb.[81] In 1935 and 1940, Wassily de Basil's Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo revived the Ballets Russes production with Fokine's choreography and Goncharova's designs.[81][83]
Many later revivals modeled their choreography after Fokine's, including Adolph Bolm's 1945 production at the Ballet Theatre and Serge Lifar's 1954 Paris Opera Ballet production.[31] Serge Grigoriev and Lubov Tchernicheva's 1954 Sadler's Wells Ballet staging with Fokine's choreography is considered one of the most important and authentic revivals; Grigoriev and Tchernicheva worked for Diaghilev during the initial run, and the lead dancer, Margot Fonteyn, was coached by Karsavina. The Sadler's Wells staging also used Goncharova's 1926 designs. A film version of the revival was made in 1959.[31][84]
New York City Ballet's first big hit as a company after their founding in 1948 was its staging of The Firebird the following year, with Maria Tallchief as the Firebird, choreography by George Balanchine, and scenery and costumes by Marc Chagall.[81][31] Balanchine placed a heavy emphasis on the dancing rather than Stravinsky's score, establishing Tallchief as one of the first celebrity American-born and -trained ballerinas.[85] Balanchine revised it in 1970 with Jerome Robbins, the latter of whom choreographed Koschei and his subjects' dance. The young Gelsey Kirkland danced the title role with a new costume inspired by Chagall's sets. New York City Ballet's production remains the most well-known and longest-lived revival in the United States.[31][86]
Maurice Béjart's 1971 production differed from the traditional themes of the ballet; it featured a male Firebird, representative of the spirit of revolution, leading an all-male group of partisans clad in blue tunics and dungarees through political turmoil.[87][88][89] After the Firebird, dressed in a red leotard, dies in battle, he ""rises from the ashes and lives again"", as Béjart said in an interview for The New Yorker.[88][85] In 1970, John Neumeier devised a science-fiction production of the ballet set in a futuristic world but retaining the original plot. In the initial Oper Frankfurt production, Koschei is a large glass robot with CCTV eyes; the Firebird, wearing a white space suit, defeats him by destroying a specific valve in his system.[90][91] Neumeier was praised by the critic Oleg Kerensky for giving the ballet ""new life"" and creating a fascinating effect for the audience ""which the original Fokine-Golovine [sic] production must have had in Paris sixty years ago"".[92] Many other choreographers have staged the work with Fokine's original choreography or created entirely new productions using the music. Stagings with new choreography include John Cranko's 1964 production with the Stuttgart Ballet, Glen Tetley's 1981 staging with the Royal Danish Ballet, John Taras's 1982 Caribbean-set rendition with the Dance Theatre of Harlem, Christopher Wheeldon's 1999 production with the Boston Ballet, Krzysztof Pastor's 1999 version with the West Australian Ballet, and Alexei Ratmansky's 2012 production with the American Ballet Theatre.[87][89][93]

Legacy[edit]
Critics praised the music of The Firebird's emotional character. Cyril W. Beaumont wrote: ""[The Firebird ] is a supreme example of how music, although having no meaning in itself, can, particularly with a programme hint of its intention, evoke a mood appropriate to the ballet concerned.""[78] Robert Craft considered the music ""as literal as opera"",[94] referring to the ""mimetic specificity"" with which the music follows the story,[95] a trait Stravinsky later disliked and apologized for.[96] The composer wrote that The Firebird became a centerpiece in his career; his conducting debut was a ballet performance of The Firebird in 1915, and he said that he performed it ""nearly a thousand times"" more.[97]
Fokine's revolutionary Firebird character was part of an effort to combine new ideas with classical ballet, showing his wide-ranging abilities as a choreographer.[58] He later described his style as a diversion from the ""conventional system of gesticulation"" and a move towards natural expression through movement.[98] The wide resources and experienced artists that Fokine accessed allowed him to create massive productions like The Firebird. Each character or group had their own unique choreography, creating complex scenes like the ""Infernal Dance"", where the Firebird enchants Koschei's subjects but they all dance differently. Dance critic Alastair Macaulay called this the ""most complex choreography that had ever been attempted in ballet"" at the time.[99]

Music[edit]
General character[edit]
Drawing by Léon Bakst of Tsarevitch Ivan capturing the FirebirdThroughout the score, Stravinsky used leitmotifs (short, recurring musical phrases associated with a particular person, place, or thing) placed in the harmony, a system he later dubbed ""leit-harmony"".[100] The idea of leit-harmony was likely introduced to the composer through Rimsky-Korsakov's operas The Golden Cockerel (1907) and Kashchey the Deathless (1902).[100][101][102] In these works, mortal elements were associated with the diatonic scales while supernatural elements were associated with the chromatic scale.[101] For example, Stravinsky describes Koschei's leit-harmony as consisting of ""Magic Thirds""; the harmony begins with a major or minor third, and the lower voice ascends a tritone while the higher voice descends a half step.[103] The title character's leit-harmony uses a chromatic descent of the first four notes of the introduction, then reversing those notes, giving the music an ""iridescent sheen"", as Eric Walter White described it.[104]
Stravinsky wrote that The Firebird may be the first appearance of ""metrical irregularity"" in his music. The passage is marked 74, with barlines dividing measures into sets of one and two.[97] White wrote that the composer's earlier works made use of consistent musical pulses, ""which was to be disturbed as little as possible by tempo rubato"".[105] Stravinsky remarked that he composed The Firebird in ""revolt against Rimsky"", and that he ""tried to surpass him with ponticello, col legno, flautando, glissando, and fluttertongue effects"".[106]
A performance of the full ballet lasts about 45 minutes.[107]

Instrumentation[edit]
The work is scored for a large orchestra with the following instrumentation:[108]


Woodwinds
2 piccolos (2nd doubles 3rd flute)
2 flutes
3 oboes
English horn
3 clarinets in A (3rd doubles clarinet in D)
bass clarinet in B♭
3 bassoons (3rd doubles 2nd contrabassoon)

cymbals
triangle
tambourine
tamtam
glockenspiel
xylophone
piano
celesta
3 harps
timpani
Strings
first violins
second violins

Stravinsky described the orchestra as ""wastefully large"",[109] but White opined that the orchestration allowed him to use a variety of effects, including horn and trombone glissandi borrowed from Rimsky-Korsakov's parts of Mlada (1872).[110][111]

Music and plot[edit]
Audio playback is not supported in your browser. You can download the audio file.
The Firebird opens with a slow introduction describing Koschei's enchanted garden, underlined by the low strings presenting the basis of the Firebird's leit-harmony.[112][113] In the garden are Koschei's enemies petrified into statues.[26] Crescendo and decrescendo phrases in the strings and woodwinds indicate the entrance of the Firebird, being pursued by Prince Ivan. The Firebird's capture by Ivan is depicted with sforzando chords in the horns, and exotic melodies in the oboe, English horn, and viola play as she begs to be released. After the Firebird is freed, Ivan takes one of her feathers, and thirteen enchanted princesses (all captives of Koschei) enter the garden to play a catching game. Ivan introduces himself to the youngest princess, with whom he has fallen in love, and they perform a slow khorovod. The melody for the khorovod is taken from a Russian folk song that Rimsky-Korsakov used in his Sinfonietta on Russian Themes (1879).[114][115][116] Offstage trumpets call the princesses back into the palace, but when Ivan pursues them, bells ring out and Koschei appears in front of the gates, signaled by roars in the timpani and bass drum.[115][117]

You can download the audio file.Before Koschei can turn Ivan into stone, the prince summons the Firebird with the feather, and she enchants Koschei and his subjects and begins the famous ""Infernal Dance"". Another Rimsky-Korsakov reference, the melody is borrowed from Rimsky-Korsakov's parts of Mlada, adding syncopation and startling strikes throughout the theme.[115][117] As the dance winds down with very loud brass glissandos, Koschei and his subjects fall asleep from exhaustion. The bassoon introduces the Firebird's tranquil lullaby. Ivan is instructed to destroy the egg that holds Koschei's soul. The music jostles around as Ivan tosses the egg from hand to hand.[113][115]

When Ivan crushes the egg, Koschei dies and the scene is surrounded in ""Profound Darkness"" while his subjects and enemies are freed from their enchantments. The finale opens with a solo horn announcing the break of dawn, another theme borrowed from Rimsky-Korsakov. The theme grows in the orchestra, building into a triumphant celebration among the freed subjects ending in a brass fanfare.[113][115][118]

Suites[edit]
Ivan Bilibin. A warrior – costume design for a 1931 performance
Shortly after the completion of The Firebird, Stravinsky wrote a piano solo reduction of the whole ballet.[110] The composer later arranged three suites for concert performance, dated 1911, 1919, and 1945.[26][119]

1911 suite[edit]
Introduction – Koschei's Enchanted Garden – Dance of the Firebird
Supplication of the Firebird
The Princesses' Game with Golden Apples
The Princesses' Khorovod
Infernal Dance of all Koschei's Subjects
The first suite, titled ""suite tirée du conte dansé 'L'oiseau de feu'"", was composed in 1911 and published by P. Jurgenson the following year. The instrumentation is essentially the same as that of the ballet. The score was printed from the same plates,; only the new endings for the movements were newly engraved. A performance of the 1911 suite lasts about 21 minutes.[120]

1919 suite[edit]
Introduction – The Firebird and its Dance – Variation of the Firebird
The Princesses' Khorovod (Rondo)
Infernal Dance of King Kashchei
Lullaby
Finale
This suite was composed in Morges, Switzerland, for a smaller orchestra. Walsh alleged the suite was composed to re-copyright the work, as Stravinsky sold the new suite to his publisher J. & W. Chester, despite the original ballet still being in copyright.[121][122] The score contained many errors; Stravinsky wrote in 1952 that ""the parts of the 1919 version were in such poor condition and so full of mistakes"".[123] Regardless, the 1919 suite remains the most popular today.[113][115] A performance of the 1919 suite lasts about 26 minutes.[120]

1945 suite[edit]
Introduction – Prelude and Dance of the Firebird – Variations (Firebird)
Pantomime I
Pas de deux: Firebird and Ivan Tsarevich
Pantomime II
Scherzo: Dance of the Princesses
Pantomime III
Rondo (Khorovod)
Infernal Dance
Lullaby (Firebird)
Final Hymn
In 1945, shortly before he acquired American citizenship, Stravinsky was contacted by Leeds Music with a proposal to revise the orchestration of his first three ballets to recopyright them in the United States.[124][119] The composer agreed and fashioned a new suite based on the 1919 version, adding to it and reorchestrating several minutes of the pantomimes from the original score.[125] The only instrumentation change was the addition of a snare drum. A performance of the 1945 suite lasts about 28 minutes.[126]

Recordings[edit]
Stravinsky received several commissions to transcribe his works for player pianos, some from the London Aeolian Company and some from the Paris Pleyel Company.[127] In 1928, the Aeolian Company published an ""Audiographic"" piano roll of The Firebird, containing both the piano reduction and comments on the work by Stravinsky. The composer identified many of the leit-harmonies in the opening comments of the roll, providing an invaluable resource for information on the ballet.[128]
The first orchestral recording of The Firebird was released by Columbia Records in 1928 with Stravinsky conducting L'Orchestre des Concerts Straram.[129][130] The 78 RPM record consisted of the 1911 suite with the Lullaby and Finale from the 1919 suite, as well as a recording of The Rite of Spring.[130] In 1933, Stravinsky and the violinist Samuel Dushkin recorded a reduction of the ""Scherzo"" and ""Lullaby"" for His Master's Voice. Stravinsky recorded the 1945 suite with the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra of New York in 1946, and the complete ballet with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra in 1961.[129] A film version of the Sadler's Wells Ballet revival was made in 1959, with Margot Fonteyn in the lead role.[84]

Ballet by Frederick Ashton


Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora DuncanChoreographerFrederick AshtonMusicJohannes BrahmsPremiere15 June 1976 (1976-06-15)Sadler's Wells TheatreCreated forLynn SeymourGenreNeoclassical ballet
Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan is a ballet solo choreographed by Frederick Ashton to music by Johannes Brahms, inspired by Isadora Duncan and created for Lynn Seymour. The first version, under the title Brahms Waltz, used only Brahms' Op. 39, No. 15, and premiered on 22 June 1975, at the Hamburg State Opera. The expanded version, which featured more Brahms waltzes, premiered on 15 June 1976, during Ballet Rambert's 50th anniversary gala, at the Sadler's Wells Theatre, London, and is dedicated to Marie Rambert.


Background and production[edit]
During the Easter holiday in 1921, the 17-year-old Ashton saw a performance of Isadora Duncan at Prince of Wales Theatre, London. Duncan, 44, was in semi-transparent drapes and had badly dyed red hair, though the performance captivated Ashton, and he returned a few more times.[1]: 44–45 [2] One of the dances is set to a Brahms Waltz, with her running forward while strewing rose petals with her hands.[3] He later recalled,I didn't think I'd like it, but I was completely captivated. I suppose she was rather blowsy about that time – I remember she had red hair – and the first impact gave me a bit of a shock, but that soon passed... She wasn't really the old camp that everyone makes her out now, she was very serious, and an immensely strong personality that came right across the footlights and held the audience and compelled them completely.[1]: 44 
In 1975, the Hamburg Ballet was having a gala tribute to Vaslav Nijinsky. At a party, Lynn Seymour, who had worked with Ashton at the Royal Ballet, and John Neumeier, the artistic director of Hamburg Ballet, convinced Ashton to choreograph a solo inspired by Duncan, a major influence of Nijinsky, for the gala.[1]: 510  It was the first collaboration between Ashton and Seymour since The Two Pigeons in 1961, as the latter had since worked with Kenneth MacMillan closely.[1]: 510–511  The solo is set to Brahms' Waltz No. 15,[4] which was used in Duncan's petal dance.[1]: 511 
In 1976, Ashton expanded the solo, titled Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan for Ballet Rambert's 50th anniversary gala,[1]: 512  with Brahms' Waltzes Nos. 1, 2, 8, 10 and 13, in addition to No. 15, with No. 1 used as a prelude before the dancer enters.[5] Marie Rambert, who idolised Duncan, watched the solo before the official premiere, and reacted positively to the solo, ""that's exactly what I remember.""[1]: 512  Five Brahms Waltzes is dedicated to Rambert.[5]
Ashton chose to be inspired by the Duncan performances he saw, rather than recreate her choreography, though he replicated some of Duncan's choreography, including the petal dance at the beginning of the solo. He described, ""[Seymour] had her hands full of petals and as she runs forward the petals streamed behind her.""[1]: 511 [2] He brought photos of Duncan taken by Arnold Genthe, watercolour paintings by André Dunoyer de Segonzac and Abraham Walkowitz, and a programme from a Duncan performance he had kept to rehearsals.[1]: 511  According to Seymour, Ashton drew a peachy-pink line on the programme, as a reminder of the colour of Duncan's costume.[2] The costume of the ballet included a red wig and transparent pink chiffon dress, similar to what Duncan wore.[1]: 511 [4]

Performances[edit]
The first version of the solo, Brahms Waltz, premiered on 22 June 1975, at the Hamburg State Opera.[4] The expanded version, Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan, premiered on 15 June 1976, at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London, during Ballet Rambert's 50th anniversary gala.[4] It has since been revived by Rambert Dance Company, the Royal Ballet, Birmingham Royal Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet and National Ballet of Canada. Seymour staged some of the productions.[3][4][6][7]

Videography[edit]
In 1977, Seymour's performance of Five Brahms Waltzes was broadcast on PBS's Dance in America: Trailblazers of Modern Dance.[8]

Flames of Paris or The Flames of Paris (Russian: Пла́мя Пари́жа) is a full-length ballet in four acts, choreographed by Vasily Vainonen with the stage director Sergei Radlov to music by Boris Asafyev based on songs of the French Revolution. The libretto by Nicolai Volkov and Vladimir Dmitriev was adapted from a book by Felix Gras. It was premiered at the Kirov Theatre in Leningrad on 7 November 1932, with Natalia Dudinskaya as Mireille de Poitiers, Vakhtang Chabukiani as Jérôme, Olga Jordan as Jeanne, Nina Anisimova as Thérèse, and Konstantin Sergeyev as Mistral. 
The Bolshoi Ballet premiered the full work on 6 July 1933 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, with Aleksey Yermolayev (Jérôme), Anastasia Abramova (Jeanne), Nadezhda Kapustina (Thérèse) and Marina Semenova (Mireille de Poitiers). The conductor was Yuri Fayer.

A new production (using some of the original choreography) was staged in 2008 by Alexei Ratmansky for the Bolshoi Ballet and is available on DVD with Ivan Vasiliev and Natalia Osipova.
In 2013 a three-act reconstruction of the Vainonen ballet was staged by Mikhail Messerer for St Petersburg's Mikhailovsky Theatre. It is based on a 1947 version done by Vainonen for the Bolshoi.    



Background[edit]
The Flames of Paris is a so-called ""revolutionary"" ballet which takes as its subject the French Revolution, including in its scenario the storming of the Tuileries Palace by the revolutionary soldiers  and their victorious march on Paris. The plot is taken from the  Felix Gras's Provençal language 1896 novel Li Rouge dou Miejour, which is translated into French as Les Rouges du Midi (Reds of the South).
Although the ballet's setting is eighteenth-century France, it is a perfect illustration of Soviet ballet in the 1920s and 1930s, during which time there was a determined effort to find subjects in world history which reflected the more immediate situation in the Soviet Union, and to show that the October Revolution was part of more universal movements and historical events.

Plot outline[edit]
This outline is different from the plot of the ballet version revived by Alexei Ratmansky for the Bolshoi Ballet.
The ballet opens in a forest near Marseilles, where the peasant Gaspard and his children, Jeanne and Pierre, are gathering firewood. When a Count and his hunting party arrive, the peasants disperse, but Jeanne attracts the attention of the Count, who attempts to embrace her. When her father intervenes, he is beaten up by the Count's servant and taken away. Next, in the city square in Marseilles Jeanne tells the people what has happened to her father and the people's indignation over the injustices of the aristocracy grows. They storm the prison and free the prisoners of the Marquis de Beauregard.
At the court of Versailles a performance of the court theatre is followed by a lush banquet. The officials of the court present a formal petition to the king, requesting permission to deal with the unruly revolutionaries. Antoine Mistral, an actor in the theatre, on discovering this secret document is killed by the Marquis de Beauregard, but before he dies he manages to pass the petition on to Mireille de Poitiers, who escapes the palace as the sound of the Marseillaise is heard through the windows.
The scene shifts to a square in Paris, where an uprising and the storming of the palace is prepared. Mireille rushes in with the document revealing the conspiracy against the revolution, and her bravery is applauded. At the height of this scene, the officers of the Marquis arrive in the square; Jeanne, recognizing the man who insulted her in the woods, runs up and slaps his face. Following this, the crowd attacks the aristocrats. To the sound of revolutionary songs, the people storm the palace and burst into the staircase of the front hall. Jeanne attacks the Marquis, who is then killed by her brother, and the Basque girl Thérèse is shot to death.
Finally, back in the Paris square, the people celebrate their victory over the defenders of the Old Regime.

In creating the choreography for this ballet, Vasily Vainonen drew upon many different sources, as did the composer Boris Asafyev. The Flames of Paris blends classical and character dancing, court and folk dances, pantomime, solo performances and group scenes.
For the part of Thérèse, for example, Vainonen chose a character dancer Nina Anisimova, who displayed strong, expressive folk movements which symbolized the energy and the spirit of the crowd. On the other hand, the dances for Philippe (originally Jérôme), one of the Marseillais, and his bride are almost purely classical: the two characters dance a pas de deux which although is reminiscent of Petipa choreographic manner, is distinctly more modern and is heroic for the male. 
As a further technique for putting classical dancing on the stage, Vainonen invented the roles of the pair of actors, Mireille de Poitiers and Antoine Mistral, who have been invited by the king to perform at the banquet. These were originally danced by Natalia Dudinskaya and Konstantin Sergeyev and are designed for outstanding ballet dancers who can display their virtuosity in a classical pas de deux. These characters are, of course, on the side of the revolutionary mob, so that after the storming of the palace, and the death of Antoine Mistral, Mireille de Poitiers is joined by the group in dances which include variations, codas, and the participation of an enormous corps de ballet consisting of 24, and later 32, dancers. In the scene at the palace of Louis XVI there is a great deal of mime sequences whilst Mireille de Poitiers dances a minuet, which is a beautiful piece of choreography in itself.

Flight Pattern is a one-act contemporary ballet by Canadian choreographer Crystal Pite, set to the first movement of Henryk Górecki's Symphony No.3. It premiered at the Royal Opera House, London, on 16 March 2017, making Pite the first woman to choreograph for The Royal Ballet's main stage in 18 years. The ballet won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production in 2018.
Flight Pattern examines the European migrant crisis. The ballet starts with 36 dancers performing on stage, and transitions to a series of duets and solos originated by dancers Marcelino Sambé and Kristen McNally. The piece was mostly positively reviewed by critics, with many praising the performance of the two soloists and the choreography of the ensemble. In 2022, Pite expanded the ballet into Light of Passage, with Flight Pattern becoming the first part of the ballet. The narrative is non-linear and the movement uses lines created by the dancers' bodies and formations of queues to create tension on stage.


Choreography[edit]
External videos An excerpt of Flight Pattern, YouTube video
Flight Pattern is a one-act contemporary ballet performed in 30 minutes.[1] The music inspired the structure of the choreography, with a long and slow crescendo that transitions to a single voice. Crystal Pite, the choreographer of this piece, mimicked this structure in the creative process. She focused first on the large scale of the crisis, then on a singular story. Pite felt that an emotional connection with a single story would be more impactful to the audience than many dancers on stage.[2]
The piece begins with 36 dancers arranged in three equal rows, standing in profile to the audience and staring at a light while rocking in packed rows.[3][4][5] Vignettes of choreography are then performed by various dancers who break away from the ensemble to perform solos, duets, or small group choreography.[6][7] These include dancers who fight with each other and perform frantically in couples,[4] a body that is left on the ground as the other dancers move forward, a man that frantically moves over the other dancers,[8] an energetic duet with two men, and the reunion of a romantic couple.[6] Contrasting the vignettes are the rest of the dancers, who are performing different choreography at other parts of the stage.[9] The set then opens at the back of the stage, mimicking the entrance to a holding area for the dancers. The dancers enter the holding area and try to find a place to sleep.[3]

Marcelino Sambé, pictured here in 2010, was one of the soloists in the original performance of this piece.
The dance transitions to a pas de deux originated by Marcelino Sambé and Kristen McNally.[1][3] The choreography is broken up with moments of each dancer performing solo choreography, then returning to a duet.[10] The choreography suggests that the couple has lost a child.[1][3] During the couple's dance, the other performers place their coats on the female dancer, causing her to collapse. The performers enter a doorway, but the weight of the jackets prevents the female dancer from joining them and she remains on the ground, shivering. The male performer stays with her, dancing in frustration.[4] The ballet ends with the two dancers performing together[11] and the male soloist turning away from a closing door as the other dancers are seen darting through the opening.[5] The final movement is of the male principal dancer placing a hand on the shoulder of the female principal dancer.[10]
The choreography incorporates a loose torso and grounded movement, which are atypical in ballet.[12] A fluid, slow-moving motif sequence is repeated throughout the piece, becoming more elaborate in each reiteration. The dance becomes faster towards the middle of the work, incorporating dabbing and thrusting movements.[13] Lines were commonly used on stage to create tension, with queues of dancers formed to contrast periods of waiting with other moments of the dancers getting direction from external forces.[10] Raised arms were used to represent the wings of birds and mimic the waves of water.[14]

The Royal Ballet commissioned what would become Flight Pattern in 2014, which was Pite's first piece for the company.[2][15] While listening to possible music selections, focusing on contemporary classical music, she was thinking about the ongoing European migrant crisis.[16] She chose to choreograph to the first movement of Henryk Górecki's Symphony No.3, also known as the Symphony of Sorrowful Songs.[2][3] Pite associated the music with the migrant crisis, for which she was ""disappointed"" with the international response, and on choreographing a ballet about the crisis, she said it was her ""way of coping with the world at the moment"".[2][3] The theme and music were selected approximately one and a half years before the first rehearsal and was the starting point for Pite's creative process.[17]
Pite chose to work with a large ensemble for this piece to showcase complex choreography with simpler movement. At the beginning of the creation process, Pite created movement phrases before the rehearsals and taught them to the dancers; Lucía Piquero Álvarez, a professor at the University of Malta, speculated in her analysis of the piece that the motif  sequence was taught during this time.[15]
Nancy Bryant designed identical grey costumes in the performance;[18][4] they begin wearing grey coats,[1] but these are later taken off to reveal grey vests and loose trousers underneath.[4][18][12] Jay Gower Taylor designed the sets,[18] with dark panels that open and close throughout the performance[11] and manipulate the shape of the stage.[19] Tom Visser was the lighting designer.[20]

Performances[edit]
Flight Pattern premiered on 16 March 2017 at the Royal Opera House, London. The piece was performed as the first ballet of a triple bill that also consisted of The Human Seasons by David Dawson and After the Rain by Christopher Wheeldon.[4][2] Flight Pattern finished its original run on 24 March.[8]
Flight Pattern was revived in May 2019, with McNally and Sambé reprising their roles. It was performed as the third act in a triple bill, succeeding choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui's Medusa and Wheeldon’s Within the Golden Hour.[21] A performance was recorded and published on the Royal Ballet website, and available for purchase until December 2020.[5]
After finishing choreographing Flight Pattern, Pite was invited by Kevin O'Hare, the director of the Royal Ballet, to choreograph other new works for the company. Instead, Pite stated that she wanted to extend Flight Pattern by choreographing to the rest of Górecki’s symphony.[22] In 2022, this extended work premiered as Light of Passage, with Flight Pattern incorporated as the first part of the ballet. This was Pite's first full-length work for The Royal Ballet.[1]

Themes and analysis[edit]
The theme of the piece was the plight of displaced persons as they travelled between locations.[23] The narrative included common events that happen during migration, including looking for people in a queue, rocking a baby and bodies left behind as the crowd moves to a new location.[14] The first section of the dance contains motifs of suspensions of weight or unbalanced spins[7] while the duet between the two principal dancers shows the journey of a female character who starts as a mother providing support to her child to acting similarly to a baby who is in need of support herself.[9] The emotions displayed in the piece are developed from the tension created by the story, movement quality, music and spacing between the dancers.[24] The narrative is non-linear, particularly in the first part of the piece, with multiple story arcs shown at the same time on stage.[14]

Critical reviews[edit]
Professional ratingsReview scoresSourceRatingEvening Standard[8]The Guardian (2017 review)[6]The Guardian (2020 review)[4]The Independent[18]The Telegraph[3]
Flight Pattern received mostly positive reviews. Pite's choreography of the 36 dancers was described by Graham Watts in Bachtrack as ""beautiful""[25] and Martha Schabas in The Globe and Mail as ""masterfully layored"".[7] Reviewers differed on the emotional impact of the piece: some thought it was impactful[19][21] and that the choreography avoided abstract and metaphorical movement to a positive effect.[7] Others felt the choreography was simplistic and sanitised,[18] melodramatic,[6] or lacked the depth of her previous work.[5] Sambé's performance was ""exuded fluency and naturalness"" according to Watts[1] whilst other reviewers praised the decision to cast McNally as a soloist, especially because she was an experienced performer.[4][25]
Reviewers highlighted the 18-year gap since the Royal Ballet commissioned work from a female choreographer.[4][6][8] They also pointed out that Flight Pattern's contemporary ballet style is different from the classical ballet that the company often performs in their repertoire and from the other dances performed in the same program.[4][7] Luke Jennings, when writing for the The Guardian, stated that Flight Pattern had an inquiry and feeling that was missing from the other, classical pieces.[4] Kat Lister stated in The Independent that the performance at Royal Opera House, a location considered a classical venue, made the piece more impactful to the audience.[22] The subject matter of the choreography, highlighting the European migrant crisis, was also questioned by some reviewers. They felt that the topic negatively distracted them from the artistic achievements of the ballet.[11]

Hans Beck and Valborg Borchsenius, c. 1900
The Flower Festival in Genzano (Danish: Blomsterfesten i Genzano) is a one-act ballet by Danish choreographer and ballet master August Bournonville (1805–1879). Bournonville created the work for Denmark's Royal Ballet on December 19, 1858, at the Royal Danish Theatre, on the basis of Danes' general enthusiasm for Italy. The libretto, which is adapted from a tale in Impressions de voyage by Alexandre Dumas, tells the story of a pair of young lovers, Rosa and Paolo, which alludes to the festival still celebrated each June in Genzano, Italy. The music is by Edvard Helsted and Holger Simon Paulli. 
Bournonville was a dancer, choreographer, ballet teacher and director. He was son of the dancer and French ballet master Antoine Bournonville, who was a disciple of the great Noverre. Auguste was born in Copenhagen in 1805, studied with his father, and completed his training in France—with Vestris, the last virtuoso of the French classical style—before becoming a star of the Paris opera.
Bournonville's contributions to the development of romantic ballet, in the course of his long reign as head of the Royal Danish Ballet, far outweighed French influence. He created an entire balletic school and style, including a repertoire of more than 50 ballets, most noted for their strong characters, naturalistic (vs. exaggerated) movement, and exotic locales.


Background[edit]
The ballet premiered on 19 December 1858 in Copenhagen and was danced in its entirety by Denmark's Royal Ballet until 1929, when it was dropped from the repertoire. It is considered one of Bournonville's most perfect compositions. It has to be seen in the Festival of Flowers in Genzano which is a transition to naturalism (one of the stages of Auguste's style) and is characterized as a masterpiece of Bournonville's international virtuosity, so that it is a clear example of the Danish style, with a very strong and quite good technique, giving greater importance to the feet. This is why he made use of the vividness and variety of the jumps, the softness of the feet, the speed and brilliance of the small battery. The original ballet disappeared shortly after its premiere, but in 1875, Bournonville made a divertissement, in which he kept the pas de deux he had used in the montage he had already made for the Vienna Festival of Flowers. This remained in the repertoire until 1929 but in 1949 Harald Lander (director of the Royal Ballet) took it to the stage. That is why the entire ballet is lost but the fragment remains. It is considered one of Bournonville's most perfect compositions. It is often performed in ballet finery to show the Bournonville style.

Music[edit]
Bournonville, 1841.[1]
The so-called Flower Festival in Genzano pas de deux has become an extremely popular repertory piece with ballet companies and is often utilized in whole or in part by dancers on the ballet competition circuit. The music of this pas de deux is often erroneously credited to Holger Simon Pauli and/or Eduard Helsted in modern theatre programs, films, etc. The true origins of this famous pas de deux stem from an 1842 staging of Bournonville's Napoli for the ballet of the Kärntnertortheater in Vienna. For this production, the danseur Lorenzo Vienna—who performed the principal role of Gennaro in Napoli—created a pas de deux for the third act to new music by the Austrian composer Matthias Strebinger (1807–1874). Bournonville then added the pas de deux to the full-length The Flower Festival in Genzano and the composer of that work, Holger Simon Pauli, adapted Strebinger's music accordingly. For this reason some current companies sometimes insert the pas de deux of Festival de Flores in Genzano in the pas de deux de six of Napoli. Although it is believed that the music of the pas de deux is from the Austrian composer Strebinger, when passing from Napoli it was reorchestrated by Paulli, since he, along with Helsted, had been the authors of the original Genzano Flower Festival, and that is why he continues have attributed to him the authorship of the piece. 
The entrée of the pas de deux opens with an episode for solo violin, followed by a polka-like section. After the adage follows the male variation—this is set to a waltz taken from Adolphe Adam's score for Joseph Mazilier's 1845 ballet Le Diable à quatre. The series of relatively short, tuneful passages continues and the pas de deux concludes with a characteristic coda. The music is completely representative of ballet music from the period. The decoration was designed by Messrs, Christensen and Lund.                                                    
Regarding the performance of the work, it should be mentioned that the dancer performs a small gargouillade and her round of petit manège, with four grand jetés in the first arabesque at the end of the solo; also, the repeated series of fast relevés at the tip in his second solo. All this is part of the characteristic Bournonville style that uses few familiar steps. A small circle is performed four times by the couple, with the man holding the woman in a low inclined position and she jumps right while doing fast jambe ronds. There is also a game of flirtation between the couple at the beginning of the coda, a fact that is not found in any other Bournonville choreography. Another element that it is not usual for Bournonville to use it is the fragment where she is held by the dancer arriving at the position of first arabesque, and then turns to the left which rotates in avant arabesque and then she turns again to return to the correct first arabesque, it is not a sequence that usually found in any of the other Bournonville choreographies. In the two solos of the man the soloists perform steps that use the strong rhythms of the music. However, in the man's first solo we observe that he only follows direct lines (performs a diagonal and then moves in parallel) and is very simple in the use of the stage. The man's second solo is perhaps the only part that is totally in Bournonville's best known style.
It is not known which dancers performed the first Festival of Flowers in Genzano, but however there are old films in which the rescued pas de deux is shown.

A Folk Tale (Danish: Et Folkesagn) is a ballet in three acts, created in 1854 for the Royal Danish Ballet by the Danish ballet master and choreographer August Bournonville to the music of Johan Peter Emilius Hartmann and Niels W. Gade. The first performance took place on 20 March 1854. Set in the Middle Ages, the ballet tells the story of a changeling living among the trolls and elves. Bournonville declared the ballet ""The most complete and best of all my choreographic works.""[1]


Background[edit]
At the beginning of the 1850s, Svend Grundtvig initiated a systematic recording of Danish folklore - the stories were told and written down in every little village in Denmark – but Bournonville did not credit Grundtvig as his source of inspiration, even though today Grundtvig is probably considered to be the person who made the most effort to preserve the wealth of Danish national folk tradition. Bournonville found his inspiration in a collection of national Danish songs (Nationalmelodier) published by the philologist R. Nyerup and the composer A.P. Berggren in J.M. Thiele's collection of Danish folk legends (Danske Folkesagn) published in four volumes between 1818 and 1823. Bournonville also found inspiration in the tales collected by the Grimm brothers in Germany.
The Romantic artists had a passion for the national and the past. The early part of the 19th century was a difficult time both politically and economically for Denmark, and this naturally generated a glorification of times past. The emergent bourgeoisie needed to consolidate its cultural status and found motifs for this in national folklore. The economic growth in a rapidly expanding Copenhagen had to some extent overshadowed spiritual development. Artists interpreted their contemporary society in a purely materialistic light. Oehlenschläger's poem about The Golden Horns (Guldhornene) is probably the most famous example of this issue but Hans Christian Andersen's fairytale The Bell (Klokken) depicted the materialistic fixation of the period with humour, irony and gravity.
In the chapter about A Folk Tale in My Theatre Life (Mit Teaterliv), Bournonville makes his attitude to the present and the past clear: he indicates that our practical and rather unpoetic times (which seem about to precipitate a period of literary and artistic crop failure on the very lands that were once the richest soil of the imagination) art has fallen by the wayside. The poetic past has been replaced by a 'hypercritical' present, as Bournonville himself writes, and it is the duty of the artist to restore the spiritual, the poetry.
The artist saw himself as endowed by God with the ability to sense the true values and perspective in life. This insight was to be communicated to the ordinary citizen through art.
The function of art as a formative model was something about which Bournonville felt very strongly. In his choreographic credo he writes: It is the mission of art in general, and the theatre in particular, to intensify thought, to elevate the mind, and to refresh the senses. Music and dance elevate the mind and refresh the senses, but it is when the story comes into play that thought is intensified.
A Folk Tale takes as its starting point the archetypal dilemma of the folk ballad, the transition from one home to another in the context of a wedding, where both men and women run the risk of getting into difficulties. The men might be lured under a spell by elves and the women might be carried off by disguised nixes and it always happens in an outdoor, natural environment, which is both compelling and mysterious. Both the elves and the nixes exert a demonic and erotic power over the victims and in most cases have a fateful impact on them - many end in the grave.
Bournonville must have had the folk songs Elveskud (The Elf-shot) and Elvehøj (The Elves' Hill) in mind when he has Junker Ove linger at the hill after lunch with Miss Birthe, his fiancée, only to dream of another - a beautiful and gentle Hilda, the counter-image of Birthe. It is always at this point - the moment of doubt before a wedding - that the elves appear. For the young man in the folksong Elveskud, the encounter proves fatal. He refuses to dance with the elf girl and her punishment is so harsh that he dies. He is laid in his grave on his wedding day, followed by his fiancée and his mother. In Elvehøj, which is of a later date than Elveskud, it is God who has human fate in his hands. He lets the cock crow at dawn and the young man, who had slept by the hill, wakes from his spell (which turns out to have been a dream) and he counts himself lucky. The manager of the Royal Theatre, J.L. Heiberg - who Bournonville fell out with on numerous occasions during this period because he thought that Heiberg was trying to drive the ballet off the stage - had experienced great success with his Elvehøj, which in Biedermeier style, lets the elves' dance dissolve into dream and delusion.
Despite this, Bournonville decided to compose his own version of the story about the young man who is danced into a spell by a group of elf maidens. In an engraving from 1856, the painter Edvard Lehmann, who was also a close friend of the Bournonville family, portrayed the spellbound Junker Ove encircled by the hovering, luminous elves. Ove is briefly imprisoned in this state, but fortunately the beautiful Hilda comes to his rescue with water from a healing spring. Even though she has grown up among trolls inside the hill, we know that she is really a changeling, swapped as a baby with the temperamental Birthe, who is the real troll child. The changeling aspect means that the story never becomes as seriously dangerous for Ove as the Sylphide's enchantment is for James in Bournonville's Taglioni-inspired ballet from 1836. But then, again, the Danish Romantics did not cultivate fragmentation in the same way as the French. The Danes sought for the harmony and the idyll.
Even though both Junker Ove and Hilda suspect that they are in the wrong place in their lives as the story begins, they are not able to act on their own initiative. The dream gives Hilda an inkling of this other life, and the dream by the hill gives Junker Ove an idea about the ideal woman, but it is the crucifix and the golden goblet, two Christian symbols, which reveal the truth of the matter. Christianity is to be thanked for the restoration of harmony. Junker Ove gets his Hilda, and the promise of gold persuades Sir Mogens to be united with Birthe who, in a modern interpretation, represents the young woman with the unruly disposition unable to conform to society's norms. She is handed over - troll for gold - to Sir Mogens in order to continue her life somewhere else completely.
Following Bournonville's death, Hans Beck took over the stewardship of the ballets. In 1894,  A Folk Tale was once again on stage, in Hans Beck's production. It has since been passed down from generation to generation, re-read and re-staged by successive Bournonville interpreters: Gustav Uhlendorff in 1922, Kaj Smith in 1931, Harald Lander and Valborg Borschsenius in 1941, Niels-Bjørn Larsen and Gerda Karstens in 1952, Hans Brenaa and Kirsten Ralov in 1969, Kirsten Ralov in 1977 and 1979. The most recent version of this lively folklorist ballet was produced in 1991, staged by Frank Andersen and Anne Marie Vessel Schlüter, with settings and costumes designed by Queen Margrethe II.

Plot summary[edit]
Act I
The wealthy but fickle Birthe enjoys a forest outing with friends. She flirts with Sir Mogens though her bethrothed, the handsome Junker Ove is present. When the party leaves for home, Ove remains behind. An elf-hill nearby opens. Hilda, an elf-girl, tries to lure Ove into the hill with a magic drink in a gold cup but he refuses it and she returns to the elf-hill. The sorceress Muri conjures up a bevy of elf-girls who dance with Ove and leave him deranged.
Act II
In the elf-hill, troll brothers Diderik and Viderik both woo Hilda. Diderik, the elder, has the right of priority. Viderik protests, but his mother scolds him. In a dream, Hilda sees trolls take a human child from a cradle and steal a gold cup. Hilda recognizes the dream cup as the one she offered Ove. She suspects she is the human child in the dream and becomes uneasy. The wedding of Hilda and Diderik is celebrated with a feast. The trolls become drunk and Hilda flees.
Act III
In scene 1, Hilda dances near a holy spring as harvesters pass by and Mogens notices her. Junker Ove walks by, completely elf-struck after his nocturnal dances with the elf-girls. Hilda leads him to the healing spring where he regains his senses. When Ove tries to defend Hilda against Mogens, he is overpowered by the harvesters. Hilda flees. In scene 2, Birthe bullies her servants. She rages and admits that Hilda is the true heir to the estate while she is an elf. In the last scene of the ballet, Mogens marries Birthe after Muri offers him gold. Hilda is united with Junker Ove. Hilda and Ove celebrate their wedding with a waltz.

Music[edit]
Niels W. Gade provided the music for the beech forest scenes of Acts I and III, while J.P.E. Hartmann composed the music with an Old Norse tone for the burlesque trolls in Act II.
Act I presents the principal musical characteristics: the brisk music of the hunt, the ballad-like folksong melodies, the nobles' dignified minuet, the peasants' reel and the elf maidens' dance. Gade's orchestration shows patent inspiration from Felix Mendelssohn (1809–1957) and his A Midsummer Night's Dream.
Hartmann's music for Act II is typified by a clear-cut character idiom in which rhythmic tension and dark resonance dominate. For Hilda's solo he composed an elegant bolero and a festive galop for the drunken trolls.
In Act III, the final scene features a gypsy polonaise, followed by the Bridal Waltz, a famous composition Gade considered to be a trifle, but which nowadays accompanies practically every Danish wedding.

The Fool on the Hill is a ballet created by the British choreographer, Gillian Lynne.

Television production[edit]
In 1975 Gillian Lynne arrived in Australia to create The Australian Ballet's first work expressly commissioned for television which was jointly commissioned by The Australian Ballet and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. The Fool on the Hill ballet was inspired by the Beatles' song of the same name, and the score was arranged and orchestrated by John Lanchbery, using interpretations of Beatles' songs and featuring characters like Eleanor Rigby, and Sergeant Pepper.[1][2] The director of the television production was Bryan Ashbridge.[3] Robert Helpmann appeared as Sergeant Pepper in the original television ballet.[4]
The ballet won a number of international television awards.[2]

Stage production[edit]
The ballet was later revised for stage performances.[1] It premiered as a live stage production at the Sydney Opera House on 28 April 1976.[2]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet to music by Boris Asafyev
The Fountain of Bakhchisarai (Russian: Бахчисарайский фонтан) is a full-length ballet in four acts, choreographed by Rostislav Zakharov to music by Boris Asafyev. The libretto by Nikolai Volkov is based on the 1823 poem of the same title by Alexander Pushkin.[1][2] The ballet premiered on 28 September 1934 at the Kirov Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet, with Galina Ulanova as Maria, Olga Iordan as Zarema, Mikhail Dudko as Khan Girey,  and Konstantin Sergeyev as Vaslav.
Bakhchysarai is in the Crimea, near Yalta. The Bakhchisaray Palace was originally built in the sixteenth century and has been repeatedly destroyed and rebuilt since. The fountain, which still stands in a courtyard, is called the Fountain of Tears.

Synopsis[edit]
The ballet opens at Bakhchisarai Palace, where Khan Girey is seated surrounded by his court. Dancers try to entertain him but he is oblivious to his surroundings, staring at water trickling from a fountain.
The scene shifts back in time to the palace of a Polish nobleman, where a ball is being held for the engagement of Maria, the daughter of the house, to the young noble Vaslav. Suddenly lurking Tartars led by Khan Girey scale the walls and attack the guests. After a vicious fight in which the Khan kills Vaslav, the palace is looted and torched and the women carried away as part of the booty. Maria hides her face, but the Khan tears away her scarf and is mesmerized by her beauty.[3]
The Khan and his warriors return to Bakhchisarai Palace where he is greeted by Zarema, his harem favorite. While Zarema, who obviously loves him, is overjoyed at his return, the Khan ignores her completely in his preoccupation with Maria. He has Maria installed in an apartment isolated from the harem and visits her there. Laying his heart at her feet he tries to make her love him, but Maria is appalled and rejects him. In their brief struggle the Khan's hat falls to the floor. The Khan returns to the court where Zarema tries to win his attention by dancing for him, but he rejects her and she collapses in despair.
During the night Zarema steals out of the harem and past the guards to visit Maria in her chamber. She tries to tell Maria how desperately she loves the Khan, finally drawing a concealed dagger to stab her unwilling rival. At first afraid, Maria stands before Zarema and opens her arms wide, showing Zarema that she would welcome death. Zarema is stunned and falls to the ground. Maria tries to comfort her, but Zarema has seen the Khan's hat on the floor. Fearing the worst, she is again inflamed with jealousy. As the Khan and his guards rush in to try and stop her, Zarema breaks free and stabs Maria to death. The Khan draws his own dagger to kill Zarema, but she kneels down in front of him and offers her chest to the knife, just as Maria did. The Khan cannot kill her, but commands the guards to take her away to be flung to her death from the palace walls.
In the court, Khan Girey sits, devastated, and stares at the Fountain of Tears, as his orders are carried out.

Popular culture[edit]
The Stars of the Russian Ballet[4] is a 1953 Soviet film production that includes abridged versions of Swan Lake, The Fountain of Bakhchisarai and Flames of Paris.
In the film the roles were danced by Galina Ulanova (Maria), Maya Plisetskaya (Zarema), Pyotr Gusev (Khan Girey), and Yuri Zhdanov (Vaslav). This is the only known footage of Ulanova and Plisetskaya, who succeeded Ulanova as prima ballerina assoluta of  the Bolshoi Theatre, dancing together.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

(Redirected from The Four Temperaments (ballet))
Orchestral work and ballet by Paul Hindemith


This article is about the score by Hindemith and ballet choreographed by Balanchine. For the ""four humours"" in Greco-Roman medicine, see Four temperaments. For the symphony by Carl Nielsen, see Symphony No. 2 (Nielsen).
Kansas City Ballet dancers in The Four Temperaments (2015 production)
The Four Temperaments or Theme and Four Variations (The Four Temperaments)[1][2] is an orchestral work and ballet by Paul Hindemith. Although it was originally conceived as a ballet for Léonide Massine,[1] the score was ultimately completed as a commission for George Balanchine, who subsequently choreographed it as a neoclassical ballet based on the theory of the four temperaments.
The music was premiered in Switzerland by the Stadtorchester Winterthur under the direction of Hermann Scherchen on March 10, 1943.[3] However, Balanchine created the choreography a few years later. The ballet, The Four Temperaments was the first work Balanchine made for the Ballet Society, the forerunner of the New York City Ballet, and premiered on November 20, 1946, at the Central High School of Needle Trades, New York, during the Ballet Society's first performance. Though at the premiere, critics did not receive the ballet well, it was later acknowledged as a ""masterpiece,"" and was revived by ballet companies worldwide.


Background and production[edit]
Kansas City Ballet's Angelina Sansone and Liang Fu in The Four Temperaments
Hindemith's score was borne from the success of his previous collaboration with Massine, Nobilissima Visione. Initially, they both conceived of a ballet based on the paintings of Pieter Brueghel the Elder, a score which the composer was projecting to being akin to a ""Flemish peasant Persephone."" Although Hindemith had composed a significant portion of the score according to Massine's scenario by 1940, he lost confidence in the choreographer after he devised an entirely new scenario for the work. On April 26, 1940, Hindemith wrote to his publisher, Willy Strecker of B. Schott's Söhne, that he had ""broken off"" his partnership with Massine, but that work on the score was continuing on schedule.[1] Although definitive proof has not been established,[1] it is generally believed that Hindemith's music from his aborted project ultimately became The Four Temperaments.[4] On November 4, 1940, Hindemith wrote that the music was ""quite good and worthy of a better cause.""[5]
Balanchine first commissioned the score from Hindemith for his own amusement, as a way to spend his income from working on Broadway and Hollywood, hoping he could enjoy listening to and play it on the piano. At the time, Balanchine approached Hindemith's agent about a commissioned and learned that it would cost five hundred dollars, but Hindemith was unavailable at the time. A year later, he became available, and the first part of the music was sent to Balanchine a week later.[6]: 208  The piece, ""Theme with Four Variations (According to the Four Temperaments), for string orchestra and piano"",[7] had its first hearing at Balanchine's apartment in 52 Street, Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, conducted by Edvard Fendler, Nicholas Kopeikine on the piano, and the orchestra consisted of Balanchine's friends including Nathan Milstein, Samuel Dushkin, Léon Barzin and Raya Garbousova.[6]: 208 
Balanchine first considered using Hindemith's score for a ballet in 1941, when the American Ballet was going tour in Latin America, sponsored by the State Department. The piece would be titled The Cave of Sleep, and Pavel Tchelitchew was brought in to design, but the project was abandoned due to its cost and Hindemith's objection.[6]: 208 
Hindemith's piece was ultimately used in The Four Temperaments, the first ballet George Balanchine choreographed for the Ballet Society.[6]: 209  The Ballet Society, co-founded by Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein, was a subscription-only company that would mainly perform new works, and the forerunner of New York City Ballet.[6]: 206 [8] One of the lead dancers in the original cast, Tanaquil Le Clercq, was seventeen when she created a lead role in this ballet, which was also her first professional solo role.[6]: 239 
The costumes of the original production were designed by Kurt Seligmann, and were deemed impractical. Le Clercq called them ""hideous"" and ""gave you a feeling of claustrophobia I can't describe."" She noted the costumes include a wig with ""a large white horn in the middle like a unicorn's,"" which she called ""very irritating."" It also included wings with ""fingers enclosed.""[9] Starting with a 1951 New York City Ballet revival, the costumes were replaced with practice clothes, which include black leotards for women, white T-shirts and black tights for men.[10][11]

Choreography and analysis[edit]
... [The ballet] is an expression in dance and music of the ancient notion that the human organism is made up of four different humors, or temperaments. Each one of us possesses these four humors, but in different degrees, and it is from the dominance of one of them that the four physical and psychological types—melancholic, sanguinic, phlegmatic, and choleric—were derived ... Although the score is based on this idea of the four temperaments, neither the music nor the ballet itself makes specific or literal interpretation of the idea. An understanding of the Greek and medieval notion of the temperaments was merely the point of departure for both composer and choreographer.— George Balanchine, Balanchine's Complete Stories of the Great Ballets (1977)[12]: 253 
The Four Temperaments, subtitled A Dance Ballet without Plot.[8] is an ""abstract"" plotless ballet, and as biographer Bernard Taper described, ""unlike anything that had ever been seen in ballet before.""[6]: 209  The choreography stems from the music, with emphasis on ""pulse drive"", ""change of weight"" and ""foot and leg work"", which would become part of Balanchine's vocabulary in making modernist works. The ballet features a theme and four variations that are based on the theory of four temperaments, including Melancholic, Sanguinic, Phlegmatic and Choleric.[8]
The ballet starts with the Theme, with three separate pas de deux. In the book The Faber Pocket Guide to Ballet, dance critic Luke Jennings and former Royal Ballet principal dancer Deborah Bull described, ""The mood is pensive; several physical motifs are carefully developed, and by the third pas de deux the music’s speed is gathering.""[13] The first variation, ""Melancholic,"" starts with a male principal dancer. On the choreography of this role, Jennings and Bull wrote, ""His movements are articulate, plastic and considered, but he is so earth-bound, and so abject. He searches for escape, but is imprisoned by his fascination with his own condition."" Then, he joined by two female soloists, before four other women also enters the stage.[13] At the end of this section, the man bend his back backwards.[8]
The second variation, ""Sanguinic,"" starts with a duet. Jennings and Bull commented, ""Their steps and lifts are lit with morning brightness, hungry and speedy.""[13] The New Yorker critic Arlene Croce noted the female role ""is an allegro technician; but is also in character.""[7] They are then joined by a corps de ballet of four women.[13] The third variation, ""Phlematic,"" also starts with a male solo, which Jennings and Bull called ""considerable articulacy, but his elaborate designs come to nothing in consequence of his intense inward focus.""[13] He is later joined by another four women.[13] Croce wrote that this section ""is indolent, tropical, given to detached contemplation, to pretentious vices.""[7] The fourth and final variation, ""Choleric,"" begin with a female solo, which Croce called an ""angry goddess,"" then joined by the entire cast.[7] The ballet ends with a series of grand jeté lifts.[13]
At the premiere of the ballet, it was not well-received by critics for being ""cold and depressing,"" but it was later regarded, as Jennings and Bull described, a ""masterpiece.""[13] In 1975, Croce wrote that it ""is a messianic work, which conveys to this day the sense of a brilliant and bold new understanding.""[7] The ballet is now regarded as one of Balanchine's ""black and white"" ballets.[8] In The Cambridge Companion to Ballet, edited by Marion Kant, it was described that by shifting to practice clothes, ""Balanchine shifted the focus from spectacle to the dance itself and especially to the unadorned body and its natural line, its flexibility, agility, strength and submission to the force above all explored in The Four Temperaments.""[8] It influenced other ballets with similar style choreographed by Balanchine, including Ivesiana, Agon, Movements for Piano and Orchestra, Stravinsky Violin Concerto and Kammermusik No. 2.[6]: 209

Performances[edit]
Kansas City Ballet dancers in The Four Temperaments
The Four Temperaments premiered on November 20, 1946, at the auditorium of Central High School of Needle Trades (now High School of Fashion Industries) during Ballet Society's first performance. The stage was merely a raised surface, while the fifty members of the orchestra performed right in front of the audience due to the lack of an orchestra pit.[6]: 207 [9][15] Ravel's opera L'enfant et les sortilèges, also choreographed by Balanchine, was also performed the same night.[15] Due to the company's subscription-only policy, the press was not invited, but reviewers nevertheless were able to attend the performance by either purchasing a subscription themselves, or as Bernard Taper wrote, ""sneaking into the auditorium.""[6]: 209 
New York City Ballet, the successor of Ballet Society, revived The Four Temperaments during one of their earliest performances.[16] Other ballet companies that had performed the ballet include Paris Opera Ballet,[17] The Royal Ballet,[18] San Francisco Ballet,[19] National Ballet of Canada,[20] Dutch National Ballet,[21] Vienna State Ballet,[22] The Australian Ballet,[9] Pacific Northwest Ballet,[23] Boston Ballet,[24] Houston Ballet,[25] Joffrey Ballet,[26] Pennsylvania Ballet[27] and Dance Theatre of Harlem.[28] At New York City Ballet's ""Balanchine: The City Center Years"" program in 2018, The Four Temperaments was performed by The Joffrey Ballet.[26] The School of American Ballet, the affiliate-school of New York City Ballet, had included The Four Temperaments in their annual workshop performances.[29]

Videography[edit]
In 1977, Balanchine, who had long been interested in filming ballets, placed The Four Temperaments as his first choice for PBS' Dance in America broadcast.[8] Dancers who appeared in this broadcast include Bart Cook, Merrill Ashley, Daniel Duell, Adam Lüders and Colleen Neary.[30]

Ballet by Christopher Rouse
Friandises is a ballet in five movements written by the American composer Christopher Rouse and originally choreographed by Peter Martins.  The score was jointly commissioned by the New York City Ballet and the Juilliard School and was completed in September 2005.  It was first performed by the New York City Ballet February 10, 2006 at the New York State Theater in Lincoln Center, New York City.  The title of the piece loosely translates in the French language to ""bits"" or ""morsels"".[1][2]


Composition[edit]
Structure[edit]
Friandises has a duration of roughly 25 minutes and is composed in five movements in the style of a Baroque suite:[1]

Intrada
Sicilienne
Passepied
Sarabande
Galop
Instrumentation[edit]
The work is scored for an orchestra comprising two flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), two oboes, two clarinets (2nd doubling bass clarinet), two bassoons, four French horns, two trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion, harp, and strings.[1]

Reception[edit]
Reviewing the world premiere, Jennifer Dunning of The New York Times called the piece ""big and orchestral, with lots of shimmering strings, gleaming brass and thudding kettle drums.""[3]  Referring to its title, Joel Lobenthal of The New York Sun remarked that ""the score serves up one glancing musical allusion after another.""[4]  Music critic Anne Midgette compared parts of the music to Gustav Mahler's Adagietto and called it ""loud, brash and invigorating.""[5]

Frizak the Barber (The Barber or Frizak or The Double Wedding) is a comic ballet in one act, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music adapted by Ludwig Minkus from themes derived from Italian opera (from the works of Giacomo Meyerbeer, Giuseppe Verdi, Vincenzo Bellini and Gioacchino Rossini).
The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on March 11/23 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates) 1879 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kammeny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia.
The principal dancers at the première included Mariia Gorshenkova and Pavel Gerdt.

Notes[edit]
It has been conjectured by ballet historians that this work was a revival of a ballet of the same title originally produced by Petipa's father Jean for the Ballet du Théâtre de la Monnaie in Brussels, Belgium, where it was first performed on 19 February 1822.

Gaîté Parisienne (literally, ""Parisian Gaiety"") is a 1938 ballet choreographed by Léonide Massine (1896–1979) to music by Jacques Offenbach (1819–1880) arranged and orchestrated many decades later by Manuel Rosenthal (1904–2003) in collaboration with Jacques Brindejonc-Offenbach, the composer's nephew.[1] With a libretto and décor by Comte Étienne de Beaumont and costumes executed by Barbara Karinska, it was first presented by the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo at the Théâtre de Monte Carlo on 5 April 1938.[2][3]


Synopsis[edit]
Performed in one act, the ballet does not have a conventional narrative. Instead, it depicts the amorous flirtations, convivial dancing, and high spirits of a diverse group of people who patronize a fashionable Paris café one evening during the period of the Second Empire (1851–1870). Members of various social classes are among the participants.
As the curtain opens, four waiters and four cleaning women are preparing the room for the evening's entertainment. They dance a merry dance before the doors are opened to the public. The first to arrive is a pretty Flower Girl, who has come to sell her nosegays to the customers. She dances happily with the waiters, flouncing her skirts and petticoats, as the charladies depart. Next to enter is a gaggle of six cocodettes, flighty young women of questionable virtue, with three billiards players as their escorts. The group dances about the room in a rousing mazurka. At its conclusion, a glamorous Glove Seller appears in the doorway and waltzes into the room, charming everyone there. A change of music announces the arrival of a wealthy Peruvian tourist, who enters in a state of high excitement. Bearing two carpetbags, he is so eager to join the Parisian nightlife that he has not stopped to deposit his luggage. The cocodettes are interested in him, and in his apparent wealth, but he is attracted to the Glove Seller. Next, to the strains of a swelling waltz, a handsome Baron enters. He is welcomed by the Flower Girl, but he is immediately captivated by the Glove Seller. When they dance together, they seem to form a perfect partnership. Drum beats and march music then signal the arrival of an Officer and a platoon of soldiers. On the lookout for girls, the soldiers engage the cocodettes and the Flower Girl in another dance. Suddenly, a fashionable society beauty, a courtesan known as La Lionne, arrives, accompanied by her escort, a Duke, and a companion, the Lady in Green. The room is now filled with people seeking an evening's diversion, entertainment, and, possibly, amorous adventure.
La Lionne, in a bright red ball gown, becomes the center of attraction. She vies for the attention of the Officer, who flirts with the Glove Seller, who contrives to make the Baron jealous by pretending to respond to the attention of the Peruvian. The Duke is disconcerted by the behavior of La Lionne, but he is also interested in the Glove Seller, and he joins the Officer, the Baron, and the Peruvian in wooing her in a vivacious pas de cinq, lifting her high above their heads and exposing her pretty legs. A quarrel develops among the four men and a fight breaks out. The Baron and the Glove Seller escape the mêlée, but almost everyone else joins in. After order is restored and everyone has left the room, the Baron and the Glove Seller return and dance an exuberant, romantic waltz, with aerial lifts and swooping turns. At its conclusion, a troupe of can-can dancers enters, led by a Dancing Master. They dance a lively can-can with the traditional high kicks, dizzying spins, whirling turns, and much display of ruffled skirts, black garters, and frothy white underthings. At the height of the ensuing merriment, everyone joins in a boisterous ballabile.
Thereafter, the mood softens; the lights dim, and to the strains of a gentle barcarole, everyone prepares to leave. Some of the guests pair off. La Lionne departs with the Officer, the Flower Girl leaves with the Duke, and others slowly drift out into the night. The Peruvian returns, expecting to find the Glove Seller waiting for him. Instead, he discovers her and the Baron in a passionate embrace. From the dusky doorway, they wave farewell to him as he is left alone in a spotlight, slumped over, drained of energy, disappointed by the outcome of the evening. The curtain closes.[4][5]

Original cast[edit]
At the premiere, the role of the Glove Seller was danced by Nina Tarakanova, the Flower Girl was Eugenia Delarova, and La Lionne was portrayed by Jeannette Lauret. Frederic Franklin took the part of the Baron, Igor Youskevitch was the Officer, and Massine himself danced the major comedy role of the Peruvian.[6] Lubov Roudenko had a specially choreographed Can-Can routine,[7] later reprising this for the 1941 film.

History[edit]
Before the opening night, the ballet was advertised under the tentative titles of Gay Mabille and Tortoni, after a Paris café, but Manuel Rosenthal recalled that Count Étienne de Beaumont, the ballet's librettist, eventually came up with the title that was used at the premiere.[8]
Massine had originally commissioned this ballet from Roger Désormière, but, owing to lack of time,[9]  he asked his friend Rosenthal to take on the commission. Initially not inclined to fulfill the assignment, Rosenthal reportedly said, ""I don't know Offenbach well; I'm not used to orchestrating the music of other people; I don't want to do it; I don't know Miasine [Massine]"". However, Désormière was insistent enough that Rosenthal eventually accepted the task.
With advice from Nadia Boulanger, Massine directed Rosenthal's selection of the Offenbach excerpts.  After completion of the score, Massine was unsure about it and was inclined to reject it. Rosenthal then proposed that Igor Stravinsky act as arbitrator over the acceptance of the score, to which Massine agreed.  Upon hearing the music, Stravinsky strongly advised Massine to accept Rosenthal's arrangements. However, because of the poor relations between Massine and Rosenthal, Rosenthal himself did not conduct the first performance of the ballet, and instead Efrem Kurtz was conductor for the ballet's premiere.[10]
Gaîté Parisienne was first presented in the United States by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, on 12 October 1938, with Alexandra Danilova as the Glove Seller and Delarova, Lauret, Franklin, Youskevitch, and Massine in the same roles they had danced at the premiere in Monte Carlo.[11] Danilova, who had shared the role of the Glove Seller with Tarakanova in Europe, became indelibly associated with the role in America. Unlike Tarakanova, who had played the Glove Seller as demure and naive, Danilova portrayed her as a vivacious, glamorous, sophisticated woman of the world.[12] As Jack Anderson wrote in The One and Only, ""Danilova in Gaîté became one of the attractions of the Ballet Russe, and the ballet often concluded a season's opening-night performance. On the opening night of the company's 1941 season in New York, when Danilova made her first entrance she was given a spontaneous ovation that stopped the show. Such show-stopping ovations thenceforth became a tradition of every opening-night Gaîté with Danilova.""[13]
The charming role of the Flower Girl was choreographed especially to suit the talents and abilities of Eugenia Delarova, Massine's second wife, and she was ideally suited to its exuberant lyricism. Frederic Franklin, young, blond, and handsome, was perfectly cast as the Baron and was long known for that role. Jeannette Lauret, a statuesque dancer with sparkling eyes, was also particularly admired as La Lionne, which she performed many times. After Massine left the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1943, Leon Danielian eventually inherited the role of the Peruvian and became closely identified with it. Over time, he altered the original choreography to suit his personal style[14] and was much admired in the role.
Other productions of Massine's Gaîté Parisienne were mounted by the Royal Swedish Ballet (1956), American Ballet Theatre (1970), London Festival Ballet (1973), and Les Ballets de Monte Carlo (1989).[15] Lorca Massine staged a revival of his father's ballet for American Ballet Theatre in 1988, with cartoonish sets by Zack Brown and extravagantly patterned and colorful costumes by French fashion designer Christian Lacroix.[16] The production was not a success and was performed only sporadically until 1999, when it was dropped from the repertory. It returned for a few performances in 2014 during the company's New York season, once again meeting with only a tepid response from audiences and critics.[17]

Recordings[edit]
The full ballet, as well as a concert suite, has been frequently performed and recorded.  Efrem Kurtz, who conducted the world premiere, recorded some of the music for Columbia Records on 78-rpm discs.  In 1947, Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra recorded the ballet for RCA Victor; this high fidelity recording was later issued by RCA as its first 33-1/3 rpm LP in 1950.  In 1954, Fiedler recorded the concert suite in stereo, his first stereophonic session for RCA.  Charles Munch also recorded the ballet for Decca as part of the Phase 4 Stereo series, as did Leonard Bernstein for Columbia. René Leibowitz and the London Philharmonic recorded it in stereo for Urania. Rosenthal himself made four recordings of the ballet.
In 1941, Warner Brothers produced a Technicolor film version of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo production of Gaîté Parisienne that it released in 1942, under the title The Gay Parisian. Directed by Jean Negulesco, it departs considerably from the original scenario of the ballet. The unit set, which was designed to conform to Hollywood's idea of elegant architecture, including a typical ""stairway to nowhere,"" bears no resemblance to a room in a Parisian nightclub or café of the Second Empire. Many costumes were redesigned to be somewhat more modest than those seen on the ballet stage, but they were realized in startlingly garish colors to take advantage of the Technicolor process. Further, Massine cut much of his choreography to achieve the desired twenty-minute length and restaged what was left for the movie camera. The result was to focus the work on the role of the Peruvian, played by himself. Besides the loss of some of the most entertaining dances, his changes also obscured the relationships of the characters. The cast also includes Frederic Franklin as the Baron, Nathalie Krassovska as the Flower Girl, Igor Youskevitch as the Officer, and André Eglevsky as the Dancing Master. The film is commercially available only as a bonus feature on the ""three-disc special edition"" of The Maltese Falcon issued in 2006 by Warner Home Video.
In 1954, Victor Jessen created a black-and-white film of Gaîté Parisienne by laboriously splicing together strips of film he had surreptitiously recorded in theaters during performances by Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo over a ten-year period (1944–1954) and then editing the footage to conform to a sound recording he had also secretly made during a performance sometime around 1954. The synchronization of sound and picture is not exact. Issued on DVD in 2006 by Video Artists International, the film stars Danilova as the Glove Seller, Franklin as the Baron, and Leon Danielian as the Peruvian. Featured performers are Tatiana Grantzeva as the Flower Girl, Robert Lindgren as the Officer, Shirley Haynes as La Lionne, Peter Deign as the Duke, Harding Dorn as the Dancing Master, and Moscelyne Larkin and Gertrude Tyven as the lead can-can girl. Optional features include audio commentary by Frederic Franklin and explanatory English subtitles.

GayaneChoreographerNina Aleksandrovna AnisimovaMusicAram KhachaturianPremiere9 December 1942Perm, Russian SFSR, USSROriginal ballet companyKirov BalletCharactersGayaneKarenArmenNuneGikoGenreClassical balletTypeSoviet ""folk"" balletGayane (Gayaneh or Gayne, the e is pronounced; Armenian: Գայանե; Russian: Гаянэ) is a four-act ballet with music by Aram Khachaturian. Originally composed in or before 1939, when it was first produced (in Yerevan) as Happiness. Revised in 1941–42 to a libretto by Konstantin Derzhavin and with choreography by Nina Aleksandrovna Anisimova (Derzhavin's wife),[1]: 133–34  the score was revised in 1952 and in 1957, with a new plot. The stage design was by Nathan Altman (scenery) and Tatyana Bruni (costumes).[2]
The first performance took place on 9 December 1942,[3] staged by the Kirov Ballet while in Perm, Russia, during the Second World War evacuation, and was broadcast on the radio.[4]: 57   The principal dancers were: Natalia Dudinskaya (Gayane), Nikolai Zubkovsky (Karen), Konstantin Sergeyev (Armen), Tatanya Vecheslova (Nune), and Boris Shavrov (Giko). The conductor was Pavel Feldt.[4]: 59  The most famous parts of the ballet are the ""Sabre Dance"", which has been performed by many (including pop artists), and the ""Adagio"", which featured prominently in Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey and forms one of the bases for James Horner's score to James Cameron's Aliens.
Khachaturian's original Gayane was the story of a young Armenian woman whose patriotic convictions conflict with her personal feelings on discovering her husband's treason. In later years the plot was modified several times, the resultant story emphasizing romance over nationalistic zeal.


Background[edit]
The ballet, based on an earlier ballet composed in 1939 by Khachaturian called Happiness,[1]: 127  was created when the Kirov ballet was in Perm. Khachaturian started composing the score in autumn 1941[3] and the ballet was first mounted on 3 December 1942 on the small stage of the Perm state theatre. Despite these limitations, the effect was profound; in effect, the message was that the company was continuing to exist and to produce new ballets, despite the very hard times. Anisimova invited different dancers to participate in her ballet, dancers who happened to be in the city at that time; there was a sense of camaraderie and combined effort which suited the positive feeling of the ballet itself. The composition, the music, the dancing, all together created something which, regardless of the weaknesses in the libretto, expressed the triumph of dancing and its many different possibilities.

Instrumentation[edit]
The orchestral score calls for:

woodwinds: 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, English horn, 3 clarinets (3rd doubling bass clarinet), alto saxophone, 2 bassoons;
Brass: 4 horns, cornet, 3 trumpets, alto trumpet, 3 trombones, bass tuba;
Timpani and percussion: triangle, tambourine, 2 side drums, cymbals, bass drum, tam-tam, doli, daira, Glockenspiel, xylophone, marimba, vibraphone, chimes;
keyboards: celesta, piano;
strings: 2 harps, violins (1st and 2nd), violas, cellos and double basses.
Plot[edit]
Many themes of interethnic love, betrayal and friendship interact in an Armenian setting. The central character is a young woman named Gayane, who works in a kolkhoz in a mountainous district near the national border.

Act I
In the Armenian kolkhoz, farmers are busy reaping cotton. Among them are heroine Gayane, her father Ovanes, brother Armen and younger sister Nune. They are all models of hard work with the only exception of Gayane's husband Giko, a lazy drunkard. She admonishes Giko for his misconduct and this escalates into a quarrel. Then arrives Kazakov, commander of the Soviet frontier guard, and a dance of welcome begins. Seeing Gayane present a bouquet to Kazakov, Giko violently snatches the bouquet from her and ignoring everybody's reproach, disappears.

Act II
At Gayane's home, people console Gayane who is deploring her husband's misconduct. The singing voices of carpet weavers are heard. As Giko returns, all go out. Gayane sings her child Ripsime to sleep. Three smugglers come to see Giko. They conspire to share the public money they have embezzled, to set fire to the cotton warehouse and to flee abroad. Overhearing their conspiracy, Gayane admonishes her husband, but he thrusts her into another room and locks her up.

Act III
At a Kurdish settlement in a mountainous area near the kolkhoz are many people, including Gayane's brother Armen, a Kurdish girl Aishe, and a Kurdish young man Izmail who loves her. Giko and the three smugglers arrive, asking Armen their way. Wondering about their intentions and activity, he sends some Kurdish youths to fetch Kazakov. Noticing this, Giko and his gang try to kill Armen, but Kazakov appears just in time and arrests the three smugglers. Giko escapes, however, and sets fire to the cotton warehouse. Trying to flee in the confusion of the moment, Giko is found by Gayane, who has managed to break out of the room in which she was imprisoned. Giko threatens Gayane that he will drop their child Ripsime from a cliff. As Gayane does not yield, Giko stabs her with a dagger. Hearing her shriek, Kazakov rushes in and arrests Giko, who will be brought to justice. Kazakov tends Gayane devotedly, and she recovers. Love grows between the two.

Act IV
A year later, at the kolkhoz, a dedication ceremony of the reconstructed warehouse occurs, as well as three weddings: Gayane and Kazakov, Armen and Aishe, Karen and Nune. Folk dances, rich in local color, are performed one after another. The ballet ends amid blessings by all.

Analysis[edit]

The ballet Gayane was modestly successful when danced before Joseph Stalin;[citation needed] performances outside the USSR have been infrequent. At the time, it was understood that the simple libretto was a necessary backdrop for the dancing, which was splendidly staged and choreographed by Anisimova, who danced in the original production. Choreographically, Anisimova thought in character dancing terms; she knew much classical dance.
Excerpts from Gayane are performed by dance companies and dance schools, especially the wedding in the second act: wonderful duets and variations for Gayane and Kazakov, her lover. The choreography was unusual for its time—classical and folk dance combined—especially the stylized use of arms and hands from the folkloric Armenian culture that is the ballet's background.
The collective farm's ethnic diversity is the backdrop for each part of the music (adagio arrangements, lively Armenian and Caucasian tunes) and for the compelling tale of love between a couple from different social classes.
The premiere cast included Natalia Dudinskaya and Konstantin Sergeyev, then leading figures in Leningrad ballet. Nina Anisimova danced the part of an Armenian girl who is an image and symbol of socialist labour: she works hard, she knows how to produce the most from the fields, but she also knows how to enjoy life, spending her free time dancing and laughing.
The suite of dances in the second act reflects the nationalities of the Soviet Union. At the time, Armenia was one of 15 republics within the Union. For that, Anisimova created the famous ""Sabre Dance"" that, when performed as a musical extract, became a showpiece for many dance companies.
The style of movement in the dance is unusual and unexpected for character dance—unusual bends of the body, inventive positions of the arms, not from the classical moves, the overall structure of the body is not balletic,[citation needed] but, most of all, in keeping with Khachaturian's music, the choreography is temperamental, like Anisimova herself.
When critics[who?] analysed Gayane, they saw that, in strict ballet terms, it is not completely successful as a whole, because of its naïve libretto and its overtly social emphasis,[citation needed] yet, choreographers, critics, and historians persuaded the Kirov Theatre to profitably stage excerpts of the ballet.[citation needed]
The ""Variation of Gayane"", the ""Variation of Giko"", and the character dances were effectively done and subsequently danced as gala pieces. After its premiere in Perm, Anisimova twice restaged Gayane for the Kirov and after revision, the 1952 version stands as the definitive version of Gayane.
In the end, Nina Anisimova proved that character dancing endures and should be included in the world of classical ballet. The dance in Gayane did not follow the Petipa tradition, for example Swan Lake, wherein the audience is treated to national dance in discrete divertissements of ""dances of le salon"", in Petipa's words; in contrast, the dance in Gayane, by force of character, is felt throughout the ballet; it is a natural part of the people and of their history.[clarification needed] In time, the ballet helped choreographers understand the importance of choreographic art in Russia, combining character dance with classical and mime traditions. Gayane is an excellent example of character dance and ballet combined; its artistic value to twentieth-century Soviet choreography is significant.[citation needed]

Derivative works[edit]
Suite from Gayane No. 1 (1943)
Suite from Gayane No. 2 (1943)
Suite from Gayane No. 3 (1943)
For concert performance Khachaturian arranged three orchestral suites drawn from the score.  Published in 1943, these became very popular.[5]  The suites exist in various configurations, and conductors often compile their own selection for any given performance.[6]
Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey featured one of the less up-tempo sections of the Gayane third suite (the Adagio).[7] The composer James Horner quoted from this same piece in three of his film scores, Patriot Games, Clear and Present Danger and Aliens. The ""Adagio"" was also used, among other pieces by Khachaturyan, in Tinto Brass's Caligula. 
The ""Sabre Dance"" features prominently in the 1961 film One, Two, Three directed by Billy Wilder and starring James Cagney, as well as in Woody Allen's 2006 film Scoop. It has also been used in numerous other movies, TV shows, and video games. Because of its feverish tempo, the music has long been a staple of novelty acts such as plate twirling.[citation needed] It is also used as the introductory and promotional theme for the professional hockey team, the Buffalo Sabres.[citation needed]

Les Gentilhommes is a ballet for nine men choreographed by New York City Ballet's balletmaster-in-chief Peter Martins to Georg Friedrich Händel's 1739 Concerti grossi, Op. 6, Nos. 9 and 2 (Largo). The premiere took place on May 15, 1987, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center.
Les Gentilhommes was subtitled ""Skol, Stanley!"" at its premiere and is dedicated to the late Stanley Williams, co-chairman of faculty at the School of American Ballet, who taught Martins at the Royal Danish Ballet school. The ballet consists of three trios of different moods preceded and followed by sections for the whole ensemble, concluding with a solo. ""In Gentilhommes, I didn't just want to make a big bravura piece, showing beats and double air turns, but showing how elegantly and beautifully men can move.""[1]

162,The Girl in White,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Girl_in_White_(ballet%29,"The Girl in White , Robert J. Bradshaw, 2011","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet No. 1 The Girl in White is a contemporary ballet in three acts written by American composer Robert J. Bradshaw.[1]  The story is based on Mexican folklore[2] and the music is influenced by Mexican folk music or Mexican Son music.[3]  The ballet was commissioned and first recorded by James Ackley and the Palmetto Camerata with funding by a University of South Carolina Provosts’ Research Grant[4] and additional support from two Crowdfunding campaigns through Kickstarter and GoFundMe.


Synopsis[edit]
The Girl in White being performed at the 37th Annual Conference of the International Trumpet Guild
Program notes[5] (included in the published score) state:

The Girl in White is the story of a young man, Ambrosio, who learns to love against all odds...even to death.  Until The Girl in White appears, Ambrosio is only concerned with the superficial - beautiful clothing, a fancy event, a drink on one side and a beautiful woman on the other.  This is love to Ambrosio, but he is mistaken.  It will take the loss of everything for him to realize what is important.
The Girl in White is loosely based in Mexican folklore.  As respected members of the community, Ambrosio and Karime’s arrival at the Grand Fiesta is filled with greetings and honorable bows.  However, a strange and beautiful woman in white appears and captures Ambrosio’s attention.  Although The Girl in White makes Ambrosio think she is playing hard-to-get, we are unable to ignore the possibility that everything unfolds exactly according to plan.
Premiere[edit]
The Girl in White was premiered at the 37th Annual Conference of the International Trumpet Guild by The Columbus Ballet (of Columbus, Georgia) and The Palmetto Camerata.[6]  The performance was choreographed by Maria Hirsch of The Columbus Ballet.[7]  According to the International Trumpet Guild conference review,[6]  “The dancers portrayed the story clearly and with great expression.  James Ackley was truly magnificent in his performance on trumpet, as he was showcased as both a technician and lyricist through Bradshaw’s aggressive and seductive score.  The members of the Palmetto Camerata cannot go without mention - in particular, the soprano tones of saxophonist Clifford L. Leaman were a perfect match to Ackley throughout.”

Modern dance version[edit]
Ipswich Moving Company, The Girl in White, final scene
The Girl in White was filmed as a modern dance by the Ipswich Moving Company on August 30 and 31, 2012.[8]  The performance was choreographed by Janet Taisey Craft, with lighting by Sandra Galley, and costumes by Tyler Kinney.[8]  The ballet was performed to a recording made by The Palmetto Camerata.[9]
The Girl in White was premiered onstage in modern dance on April 4, 5 and 6, 2014[2] at Indiana University of Pennsylvania through a collaboration between the IUP Department of Music and the IUP Department of Theater and Dance.[10]  The production was codirected by Holly Boda-Sutton and Kevin Eisensmith in collaboration with the composer, Robert J. Bradshaw.[10]

First audio recording[edit]
The Palmetto Camerata recording The Girl in White
The Girl in White was recorded by the Palmetto Camerata at the University of South Carolina (January, 5 & 6, 2012) and released by Beauport Classical (BC41213) on CD in 2012.[3]
The American Record Guide review of the CD states:[1]

In a short overture piano, marimba, and strings open mysteriously; but the music is whirling by the end.  The ballet then proceeds through three scenes, each with four short pieces.  The music is beautiful, evocative, mysterious, sensuous, and sometimes frenzied.  Bradshaw’s melodies are supple, his tonal harmonic language is often dissonant but never jarring.”

Collaboration history[edit]
Bradshaw and Ackley began collaborating in 2004 with the premiere of “Sonata” for trumpet and piano.[11]  Their collaboration continued with the opera .Gabriel, where trumpet performs as one of the main characters.  The opera was recorded by Ackley and The Palmetto Camerata[12] and premiered at the 35th Annual Conference of the International Trumpet Guild, courtesy of Opera Australia in 2010.[13]  Ackley has referred to Bradshaw's music as “unmistakably American, with a mixture of jazz and rock rhythms superimposed over fanciful melodies that ring true for the audience”[14]

Giselle (/dʒɪˈzɛl/;[1] French: [ʒizɛl]), originally titled Giselle, ou les Wilis (French: [ʒizɛl u le vili], Giselle, or The Wilis), is a romantic ballet (""ballet-pantomime"")[2] in two acts with music by Adolphe Adam. Considered a masterwork in the classical ballet performance canon, it was first performed by the Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique at the Salle Le Peletier in Paris on 28 June 1841, with Italian ballerina Carlotta Grisi as Giselle. It was an unqualified triumph. It became hugely popular and was staged at once across Europe, Russia, and the United States.
The ghost-filled ballet tells the tragic, romantic story of a beautiful young peasant girl named Giselle and a disguised nobleman named Albrecht, who fall in love, but when his true identity is revealed by his rival, Hilarion, Giselle goes mad and dies of heartbreak. After her death, she is summoned from her grave into the vengeful, deadly sisterhood of the Wilis, the ghosts of unmarried women who died after being betrayed by their lovers and take revenge in the night by dancing men to death by exhaustion (a popular theme in Romantic-era ballets). Led by Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis, they target Albrecht when he comes to mourn at Giselle's grave, but her great love frees him from their grasp. They gain their power in numbers as they effortlessly move through dramatic patterns and synchronized movements and control the stage with their long tulle dresses and stoic expressions, creating an ethereal atmosphere that builds as they gradually close in on Albrecht. By saving him from the Wilis, Giselle also saves herself from becoming one of them.
Librettists Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Théophile Gautier took their inspiration for the plot from a prose passage about the Wilis in De l'Allemagne, by Heinrich Heine, and from a poem called ""Fantômes"" in Les Orientales by Victor Hugo.
Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot created the original choreography. The role of Giselle was created for Carlotta Grisi as her debut piece for the Paris public, and she was the only ballerina to dance it at the Paris Opera for many years. The traditional choreography that has been passed down to the present day derives primarily from the revivals staged by Marius Petipa during the late 19th and early 20th centuries for the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg. One of the world's most-often performed classical ballets, it is also one of the most challenging to dance.[3]


Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
Anna Pavlova as Giselle (before 1931)
The ballet opens on a sunny autumnal morning in the Rhineland during the Middle Ages. The grape harvest is in progress. Duke Albrecht of Silesia, a young nobleman, has fallen in love with a shy, beautiful peasant girl named  Giselle, despite being engaged to Bathilde, the Duke of Courland's daughter. He disguises himself as a humble villager called ""Loys"" to court the enchanting and innocent Giselle, who knows nothing of his true identity. With the help of his squire, he hides his fine attire, hunting horn, and sword before coaxing her out of her house to romance her as the harvest festivities begin.
Hilarion, a local gamekeeper, is also in love with Giselle and is highly suspicious of the newcomer who has won her affections. He tries to convince her that her beau can not be trusted, but she ignores his warnings. Her mother, Berthe, is very protective of her, as she has a weak heart that leaves her in delicate health. She discourages a relationship between Giselle and Loys, thinking Hilarion would be a better match, and disapproves of her fondness for dancing, due to the strain on her heart.
A party of noblemen seeking refreshment following the rigors of the hunt arrive in the village with Bathilde among them. Albrecht hurries away, knowing he would be recognized and greeted by her, exposing him as a nobleman. The villagers welcome the party, offer them drinks, and perform several dances.[4][5] Bathilde is charmed with Giselle's sweet and demure nature, not knowing of her relationship with Albrecht. Giselle is honored when Bathilde offers her a necklace as a gift before the group of nobles depart.
The villagers continue the harvest festivities, and Albrecht emerges again to dance with Giselle, who is named the Harvest Queen. Hilarion interrupts the festivities. He has discovered Albrecht's finely made sword and presents it as proof that he is really a nobleman who is engaged to another woman. Using Albrecht's hunting horn, Hilarion calls back the party of noblemen. Albrecht has no time to hide and has no choice but to greet Bathilde as his fiancée. All are shocked by the revelation, but none more than Giselle, who becomes inconsolable when faced with his deception. Knowing that they can never be together, she flies into a mad fit of grief in which all the tender moments she shared with Loys flash before her eyes. She begins to dance wildly and erratically, ultimately causing her weak heart to give out. She collapses and dies in Albrecht's arms. Hilarion and Albrecht turn on each other in rage before Albrecht flees the scene in misery. The curtain closes as Berthe weeps over her Giselle's body.
In the original version, taken up again recently by a production of the ROB, Giselle stabs herself with Albrecht's sword, which explains why her body is laid to rest in the forest, in unhallowed ground, where the Wilis have the power to summon her. Most modern versions are sanitized and have edited out the suicide.

Act II[edit]
Vaslav Nijinsky as Albrecht, 1910
Late at night, Hilarion mourns at Giselle's forest grave, but is frightened away by the arrival of the Wilis, the ghostly spirits of maidens betrayed by their lovers. Many were abandoned on their wedding days, and all died of broken hearts. They, led by their merciless queen, Myrtha, dance and haunt the forest at night to exact their revenge on any man they encounter, regardless of who he may be, forcing their victims to dance until they die of exhaustion.
Myrtha and the Wilis rouse Giselle's spirit from her grave and induct her into their clan before disappearing into the forest. Albrecht arrives to lay flowers on Giselle's grave and he weeps with guilt over her death. Her spirit appears and he begs her forgiveness. She, her love undiminished unlike her vengeful sisters, gently forgives him. She disappears to join the rest of the Wilis and Albrecht desperately follows her.
Meanwhile, the Wilis have cornered a terrified Hilarion. They use their magic to force him to dance until he is nearly dead, and then drown him in a nearby lake. Then they spy Albrecht, and turn on him, sentencing him to death as well. He pleads to Myrtha for his life, but she coldly refuses. Giselle's pleas are also dismissed and he is forced to dance until sunrise.[6]  However, the power of Giselle's love counters the Wilis' magic and spares his life. The other spirits return to their graves at daybreak, but Giselle has broken through the chains of hatred and vengeance that control the Wilis, and is thus released from their powers and will haunt the forest no more. After bidding a tender farewell to Albrecht, she returns to her grave to rest in peace. 


Background[edit]
The Ballet of the Nuns in the Salle Le Peletier, 1831
The French Revolution (1789–1799) brought sweeping changes to theatre in France. Banished were the ballets the aristocracy preferred about the gods and goddesses of Mount Olympus. Instead, ballets about everyday people, real places, real time, the historical past, and the supernatural took prominence. These sorts of ballets were preferred by the burgeoning middle class.[7]
Two ballets caused great excitement in Paris in the 1830s. In November 1831, Meyerbeer's opera Robert le diable had its first performance. It featured a short ballet called Ballet of the Nuns. In this little ballet, nuns rise from their graves to dance in the moonlight. The public loved this little supernatural ballet.[8]
In March 1832, the ballet La Sylphide debuted in Paris.[8] This ballet is about a beautiful sylph who loves James, a young Scotsman. Tragedy occurs. After dallying in the woods, the sylph dies when her earthly lover uses a bewitched scarf to trap her.[9] This ballet brought Marie Taglioni before the French public. She was the first to dance en pointe for artistic reasons rather than spectacle and was also the first to wear the white, bell-shaped, calf-length ballet skirt now considered an essential feature of the romantic ballet.[10] Poet and  critic Théophile Gautier attended the first performance of La Sylphide. His ideas for Giselle would show touches of La Sylphide ten years later. It would be set in a real place and in the past, for example, and would be about everyday people and supernatural women.[11]

Development[edit]
Théophile Gautier, 1838
In an 1841 news article announcing the first performance of Giselle, Théophile Gautier recorded his part in the creation of the ballet. He had read Heinrich Heine's description of the Wilis in De l'Allemagne and thought these evil spirits would make a ""pretty ballet"".[12] He planned their story for Act II and settled upon a verse by Victor Hugo called ""Fantômes"" to provide the inspiration for Act I. This verse is about a beautiful 15-year-old Spanish girl who loves to dance. She becomes too warm at a ball and dies of a chill in the cool morning.[13]
Heine's prose passage in De l'Allemagne tells of supernatural young women called the Wilis. They have died before their wedding day and rise from their graves in the middle of the night to dance. Any young man who crosses their path is forced to dance to his death.[14] In another book, the Wilis are said to be jilted young women who have died and become vampires. This is assumed to be the reason that they hate men.[13]
Gautier thought Heine's Wilis and Hugo's fifteen-year-old Spanish girl would make a good ballet story.[15] His first idea was to present an empty ballroom glittering with crystal and candlelight. The Wilis would cast a spell over the floor. Giselle and other dancers would enter and whirl through the room, unable to resist the spell to keep them dancing. Giselle would try to keep her lover from partnering other girls. The Queen of the Wilis would enter, lay her cold hand on Giselle's heart and the girl would drop dead.[16]
Gautier was not satisfied with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end.[16] He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, a man who had written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days,[17][18] and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra.[16] Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked it as much as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.[19]

First performance[edit]
Carlotta Grisi as Giselle, 1841
The balletomanes of Paris became very excited as the opening night of Giselle approached. News reports kept their interest alive. Some reports said that Grisi had had an accident whilst other reports indicated that the conductor was ill with a tumor. Still others said that the stage hands feared for their safety.[20]
Hopes that the ballet would be ready in May were dashed and the opening night was postponed several times. Grisi was absent for a few days and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb at the end of the ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly into the earth. This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.[21]
At last, on Monday, 28 June 1841 the curtain rose on Giselle at the Salle Le Peletier.[22] Grisi danced Giselle with Lucien Petipa as her lover Albrecht, Jean Coralli as the gamekeeper Hilarion, and Adèle Dumilâtre as Myrtha, the Queen of the Wilis.[23] Typical of the theatrical practices of the time, Giselle was preceded by an excerpt from another production—in this case, the third act of Rossini's opera, Mosè in Egitto. In 1844 Marie Guy-Stéphan made her first appearance in the title role for the first production of Giselle in Spain. She performed in numerous works by Pepita.[24]
In spite of the chief machinist shouting orders to his crew that could be heard by the audience, Giselle was a great success. Grisi was a sensation. Ballet-goers regarded her as another Marie Taglioni, the greatest ballerina of the period.[25]

Contemporary reviews and comments[edit]
Giselle was a great artistic and commercial success. Le Constitutionnel praised Act II for its ""poetic effects"".[26] Moniteur des théâtres wrote that Grisi ""runs [and] flies across the stage like a gazelle in love"".[27] One critic made a detailed analysis of the music in La France Musicale. He thought the Act I waltz ""ravishing"" and noted that the scene of Berthe's narrative was filled with ""quite new"" harmonic modulations. He praised other moments in Act I (especially the mad scene), and was in raptures with the music of Act II, singling out the entrance of the Wilis and the viola solo played through Giselle's last moments. He thought the flute and harp music accompanying Giselle as she disappeared into her grave at ballet's end ""full of tragic beauty.""[28]
Coralli was praised for the Act I peasant pas de deux and for the ""elegance"" of Act II. Coralli followed a suggestion made by Gautier and picked the most beautiful girls in the company to play the peasants and the Wilis. One observer thought the selection process cruel: the almost-beautiful girls were turned away without a second thought.[29]
Grisi and Petipa were great successes as the tragic lovers. Gautier praised their performance in Act II, writing that the two dancers made the act ""a real poem, a choreographic elegy full of charm and tenderness ... More than one eye that thought it was seeing only [dance] was surprised to find its vision obscured by a tear—something that does not often happen in a ballet ... Grisi danced with a perfection ... that places her in the ranks between Elssler and Taglioni ... Her miming surpassed every expectation ... She is nature and artlessness personified.""[26]
Adam thought Petipa ""charming"" as both dancer and actor, and that he had ""rehabilitated"" male dancing with his performance. Of Dumilâtre he wrote, ""... in spite of her coldness, [Dumilâtre] deserved the success she achieved by the correctness and the 'mythological' quality of her poses: perhaps this word may seem a little pretentious, but I can think of no other to express such cold and noble dancing as would suit Minerva in a merry mood, and in this respect [Dumilâtre] seems to bear a strong resemblance to that goddess.""[26]
Giselle made 6,500 francs between June and September 1841. This was twice the amount for the same time period in 1839. Grisi's salary was increased to make her the top earner among the dancers at the Opéra. Souvenirs were sold, pictures of Grisi as Giselle were printed, and sheet music arrangements were made for social dancing. The sculptor Emile Thomas made a statuette of Giselle in her Act II costume. A silk cloth was manufactured called façonné Giselle, and Madame Lainné, a milliner, sold an artificial flower called 'Giselle'. The ballet was parodied at the Théâtre du Palais-Royal in October 1841.[30]

Music[edit]
Adolphe Adam about 1835
Adolphe Adam was a popular writer of ballet and opera music in early 19th-century France.[31] He wrote with great speed and completed Giselle in about two months.[32] The music was written in the smooth, song-like style of the day called cantilena. This style is well known to music lovers from Bellini's opera Norma and Donizetti's Lucia di Lammermoor.[33]
Adam used several leitmotifs in the ballet. This is a short musical phrase that is associated with a certain character, event, or idea. Adam's leitmotifs are heard several times throughout the ballet.[34] There is a leitmotif associated with Giselle and another with Albrecht. Hilarion's motif marks his every entrance. It suggests the Fate theme in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.
Another leitmotif is associated with the ""he loves me, he loves me not"" flower test in Act I, which is heard again in the mad scene, and in Act II when Giselle offers flowers to Albrecht. The Wilis have their own motif. It is heard in the overture, in Act I when Berthe tells the story of the Wilis, and in the mad scene. It is heard again in Act II when the Wilis make their first entrance. The hunting horn motif marks sudden surprises. This motif is heard when Albrecht is exposed as a nobleman.[35]
The music was completely original. A critic noted, however, that Adam had borrowed eight bars from a romance by a Miss Puget and three bars from the huntsman's chorus in Carl Maria von Weber's opera Euryanthe.

One dance historian wrote:By no stretch of the imagination can the score of Giselle be called great music, but it cannot be denied that it is admirably suited to its purpose. It is danceable, and it has colour and mood attuned to the various dramatic situations ... As we listen today to these haunting melodies composed over a century ago, we quickly become conscious of their intense nostalgic quality, not unlike the opening of a Victorian Keepsake, between whose pages lies an admirably preserved Valentine—in all the glory of its intricate paper lace and symbolic floral designs—which whispers of a leisured age now forever past. For a brief space the air seems faintly perfumed with parma violet and gardenia. The music of Giselle still exerts its magic.— Cyril W. Beaumont, A Ballet Called Giselle, p. 58
Additions to the score[edit]
Adam's score for Giselle acquired several additional numbers over the course of its history, with some of these pieces becoming an integral part of the ballet's performance tradition.
Immediately following the first répétition générale of Giselle on the stage of the Paris Opéra, the danseuse Nathalie Fitz-James used her influence as the mistress of an influential patron of the theatre to have a pas inserted for herself into the ballet.[36] Jean Coralli was required to quickly arrange a number for Fitz-James, which was arranged by Coralli as a pas de deux with the danseur Auguste Mabille serving as Fitz-James's partner. Coralli's original intentions were to have the ballet's composer Adolphe Adam supply the music for Fitz-James's pas, but by this time Adam was unavailable. In light of this, Coralli chose a suite by the composer Friedrich Burgmüller's titled Souvenirs de Ratisbonne to fashion music for Fitz-James's required pas.[36] This pas de deux, which was dubbed the Pas des paysans (or Peasant pas de deux), became part of the ballet's performance tradition.
For Carlotta Grisi's performances as Giselle with the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg, Perrot commissioned the composer Cesare Pugni to score a new pas de cinq for the ballerina that was added to the first tableau.[37] This pas was only retained for Grisi's performances and never performed again after her departure from St. Petersburg. Marius Petipa would also commission an additional piece for the first tableau of the ballet. This was a pas de deux from the composer Ludwig Minkus that was added to the choreographer's 1884 revival for the ballerina Maria Gorshenkova.[38] As with Pugni's 1850 pas de cinq for Grisi, Gorshenkova's 1884 pas de deux by Minkus never became part of the performance tradition of Giselle.
Three solo variations were added to the ballet by Petipa during the latter half of the 19th century. The first was arranged in 1867 for the grand pas de deux of the second tableau for the ballerina Adèle Grantzow.[39][37] The music was composed by Cesare Pugni and was based on Adolphe Adam's ""he loves me, he loves me not"" leitmotif.[37] This variation has been retained in the ballet ever since.
The second variation was added by Petipa to the first tableau for the ballerina Emma Bessone's début as Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre in 1886, and on this occasion the composer Riccardo Drigo wrote the music for the variation.[40] The music was never used again after Bessone's departure from Russia until Agrippina Vaganova added it to the Peasant pas de deux for the Kirov Ballet's production of Giselle in 1932.[41] The inclusion of this variation in the Peasant pas de deux remains part of the Mariinsky Theatre's performance tradition of Giselle to the present day.
The third variation added by Petipa was also composed by Drigo and has survived as one of the most beloved passages of Giselle. This variation, sometimes dubbed as the Pas seul, was arranged in 1887 for the ballerina Elena Cornalba's performance in a revival of Saint-Léon's Fiametta. Cornalba then included it for her début in Giselle in December of that year, where it has remained ever since.[42][40] The variation was also danced by Cornalba's successors in the role of Giselle at the Mariinsky Theatre. Cornalba's variation was first performed outside of Russia by Olga Spessivtzeva in 1924 at the Paris Opéra, and from then on all productions staged outside of Russia included the variation. There was much confusion at that time as to who was responsible for composing the music, leading many ballet historians and musicologists to credit Ludwig Minkus as the author, a misconception which still persists.

Choreography[edit]
Jean Coralli about 1830
Jean Coralli and Jules Perrot choreographed the original version of Giselle. Perrot and Carlotta Grisi were lovers and, consequently, Perrot designed all of her dances and pantomime.[43] Everyone in the Paris dance world knew that Perrot had created Grisi's dances and Coralli admitted it, but Perrot was given no official credit in the printed materials such as posters and programs.[44] This was most likely done to prevent Perrot from collecting royalties on the ballet.[45] Perrot liked bold touches and planned several rapid aerial swoops on wires in Act II for Giselle. Grisi was afraid of these swoops, therefore a stage hand was brought in to test them. He crashed face-first into the scenery and the swoops were dropped.[46]
Cyril Beaumont writes that Giselle is made up of two elements: dance and mime. Act I features short mimed scenes, he points out, and episodes of dancing which are fused with mime. In Act II, mime has become fused entirely with dance. He indicates that the choreographic vocabulary is composed of a small number of simple steps:

Movements: développé, grand rond de jambe
Poses: arabesque, attitude
Gliding steps: chasse, glissade, pas de basque, pas de bourrée
Hopping steps: balloné, temps levé
Turning steps: pirouette, petit tour, tour en l'air
Leaping steps: (vertical) ballotte, entrechat, sisonne, rond de jambe en l'air sauté, (horizontal) cabriole, jeté, grande jeté, soubresaut
Beaumont speculates that the simple steps were deliberately planned to allow the ""utmost expressiveness.""[47]
Parts of Giselle have been cut or changed since the ballet's first night. Giselle's Act I pantomime scene in which she tells Albrecht of her strange dream is cut and the peasant pas de deux is also slightly cut back. The Duke of Courland and his daughter Bathilde used to make their entrance on horseback, but today they walk on. In the original production they were present at Giselle's death, but now they leave the scene before she dies. The machines used to make Giselle fly and to make her disappear are no longer employed. A trapdoor is sometimes utilized to make Giselle rise from her grave and then sink into it at the end of Act II.[48] At the end of Act II Bathilde formerly entered with the courtiers to search for Albrecht. He took a few unsteady steps toward them and then collapsed into their arms. This moment was an artistic parallel to the Act I finale when the peasants gathered about the dead Giselle.  Now, Bathilde and the courtiers are cut and Albrecht slowly leaves the stage alone.[49]

Ethnic elements[edit]
Grisi and Petipa on the sheet music cover of ""Valse favorite de Giselle""
Ethnic music, dance, and costume were a large part of romantic ballet. At the time Giselle was written, people thought of Germany when they heard a waltz because the waltz is of German origin. Giselle makes her first entrance to the music of a waltz, and the audience would have known at once that the ballet was set in Germany. Adam wrote three waltzes for Giselle: two for Giselle and one for the Wilis. He said that the ""Giselle Waltz"" in Act I has ""all the German color indicated by the locality"" and people agreed. One critic wrote: ""A lovely waltz ... in the Germanic spirit of the subject"".[50]
At first, Gautier thought that some of the dancers in the waltz for the Wilis should dress in ethnic costume and dance ethnic steps. Adam put bits of French, Spanish, German, and Indian-sounding music in the waltz for this purpose. Gautier's ""ethnic"" idea was dropped as the ballet developed and it has not been picked up by modern producers. Today, Act II is a ballet blanc (a ""white"" ballet in which all the ballerinas and the corps de ballet are dressed in full, white, bell-shaped skirts and the dances have a geometric design).[50]

Sets and costumes[edit]
Albrecht by Paul Lormier
The historical period for Giselle is not indicated in the story. Paul Lormier, the chief costume designer at the Paris Opéra, probably consulted Gautier on this matter. It is also possible that Pillet had the ballet's budget in mind and decided to use the many Renaissance-style costumes in the Opéra's wardrobe for Giselle. These costumes were said to have been those from Rossini's William Tell (1829) and Berlioz's Benvenuto Cellini (1838). Lormier certainly designed the costumes for the principal characters. His costumes were in use at the Opéra until the ballet was dropped from the repertoire in 1853.
Giselle was revived in 1863 with new costumes by Lormier's assistant, Alfred Albert. Albert's costumes are closer to those of modern productions than those of Lormier, and were in use at the opera until 1868. The ballet was revived again in 1924 with scenery and costumes by Alexandre Benois. He wanted to revive the costumes of the original production but dropped the idea, believing the critics would charge him with a lack of imaginative creativity.[51]

Sets[edit]
Photograph of Ciceri, c. 1857
Pierre Luc Charles Ciceri was the chief set designer at the Paris Opéra from 1815 to 1847. He designed the sets for the first production of Giselle. Gautier was not specific about the ballet's locale, but placed it in ""some mysterious corner of Germany ... on the other side of the Rhine"".[52]
Giselle was two months in rehearsal, which was a very long rehearsal time for the period. Even so, Ciceri did not have enough time to design sets for both acts and focused on the second act. The sets for the first act were actually those designed for the 1838 ballet, La Fille du Danube by Adam. An illustration from Les Beautés de l'Opera of 1845 shows Giselle's cottage with a roof of straw on the left and Albrecht's cottage on the right. The two cottages are framed by the branches of two large trees on either sides of the stage. Between the two cottages, in the distance, appears a castle and slopes covered with vineyards. Although this scene was not designed for Giselle, it has remained the model for most modern productions.[53] Ciceri's set was in use until the ballet was dropped from the repertoire in 1853. At that time, Gautier noticed that the sets were falling apart: ""Giselle's cottage has barely three or four straws on its roof.""[52]

Act 2 from Les Beautés de l'Opéra
The Act II illustration from Les Beautés shows a dark wood with a pool of water in the distance. The branches of aged trees create a tree tunnel. Beneath these branches on the left is a marble cross with 'Giselle' carved on it. From one of its arms hangs the crown of grape leaves Giselle wore as Queen of the Vintage. On the stage, thick weeds and wildflowers (200 bulrushes and 120 branches of flowers) were the undergrowth. The gas jets of the footlights and those overhead suspended in the flies were turned low to create a mood of mystery and terror.[52]

Benois' design for Act I at the Paris Opera, 1910
A circular hole was cut into the backdrop and covered with a transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of its cost. In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.[54]
Adam thought Ciceri's backdrop for Act I was ""not so good ... it is all weak and pale"" but he liked the set for Act II: ""[Ciceri's] second act is a delight, a dark humid forest filled with bulrushes and wild flowers, and ending with a sunrise, seen at first through the trees at the end of the piece, and very magical in its effect."" The sunrise also delighted the critics.[26]

Early productions[edit]
Giselle was performed in Paris from its debut in 1841 to 1849, with Grisi always dancing the title role. In 1849, it was dropped from the repertoire. The ballet was revived in 1852 and 1853, without Grisi, then dropped from the repertoire after 1853. It was revived in 1863 for a Russian ballerina, then dropped again in 1868. It was revived almost 50 years later in 1924 for the debut of Olga Spessivtzeva. This production was revived in 1932 and 1938.[55]

Ballet in the Salle Le Peletier in 1864
Giselle was mounted by other ballet companies in Europe and America almost immediately after its first night. The British had their first taste of Giselle with a drama based on the ballet called Giselle, or The Phantom Night Dancers by William Moncrieff, who had seen the ballet in Paris the same year. The play was performed on 23 August 1841 at the Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells.[55] The actual ballet was first staged in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 12 March 1842 with Grisi as Giselle and Perrot as Albrecht. The dances were credited to Perrot and one Deshayes. This production was revived many times, once in 1884 with a Mlle. Sismondi in the role of Albrecht. This production, preceded by an operetta called Pocahontas,[56] met with little enthusiasm.
Giselle was first performed in Russia at the Bolshoi Theatre, St. Petersburg, on 18 December 1842. Stepan Gedeonov, the Director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, sent his ballet master Antoine Titus to Paris to find a new ballet for ballerina Yelena Andreyanova. Titus chose Giselle. The Ballet Master then staged the work completely from memory in St. Petersburg.[57] Perrot produced Giselle in St. Petersburg in 1851. He made many changes to the ballet in his years of service to the Imperial Ballet. In the 1880s, Petipa made many changes to the Perrot production.[58]
Giselle was first staged in Italy at Teatro alla Scala in Milan on 17 January 1843. The music however was not Adam's but that of Niccolò Bajetti. The dances were not the original either but those of Antonio Cortesi. It is possible that the ballet was first staged in the provincial theatres. This, however, is not known with certainty.[59]
In 1844, American ballerina Mary Ann Lee arrived in Paris to study with Coralli for a year. She returned to the United States in 1841 with the directions for Giselle and other ballets. Lee was the first to present Giselle in the United States. She did this on 1 January 1846 in Boston at the Howard Athenæum. George Washington Smith played Albrecht. Lee danced Giselle (again with Smith) on 13 April 1846 at the Park Theatre in New York City.[59][60]

Ballet by Jerome Robbins to music by Philip Glass


Glass PiecesChoreographerJerome RobbinsMusicPhilip GlassPremiereMay 12, 1983 (1983-05-12)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignBen BensonJerome RobbinsRonald BatesGenreNeoclassical ballet
Glass Pieces is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to music by Philip Glass, costumes designed by Ben Benson, lighting designed by Ronald Bates and production designed by Robbins and Bates. The ballet was premiered on May 12, 1983, at the New York State Theater, performed by the New York City Ballet.[1]


Production[edit]
Choreographer Jerome Robbins was first invited to direct Philip Glass's opera, Akhnaten. Due to the unusual nature of the opera, Robbins decided to make a ballet with the music first and figure out the stage directions. However, due to scheduling conflict, Robbins withdrew from the opera, but went ahead with the ballet.[2]
Though the score is minimal, Robbins decided to treat it differently. He made charts of the music's structure on graph paper, then worked with Ronald Bates, who also designed the lighting, to make backdrop that looks like a piece of graph paper.[2] Robbins also added ""Rubric"" and ""Façades"" from Glass's Glassworks,[3] as the scores ""struck him as being markedly different in character"". Robbins also claimed that since he was focused on the music during the creative process, he was surprised to see the critics interpret it as ""images of urban life"". On the entire ballet Robbins said it has a ""a ritualistic sense"" which may be ""inevitable"" due to Glass's music.[2]
The ballet was the first New York City Ballet (NYCB) work set to minimalist music and premiered shortly after the company's co-founder George Balanchine's death.[4]

Structure[edit]
The first part, ""Rubric"", features dancers in bright color practice wears walking across the stage,[5] and three main couples performing different choreography.[6] Whenever the couples enter the stage, the corps de ballet changes its movements. Robbins said it is like a rondo.[2]
The middle section is set to ""Façades"", which Robbins described as ""a songlike melody repeated five times"". The principal couple is the equivalent of the score while an all-female corps dances at the back of the stage in a line, representing the accompaniment.[2][5]
The third and final movement, danced to ""Akhnaten"", is called ""tribal"" by Robbins, with dancers performing in bloc patterns.[2]

Revivals[edit]
Other ballet companies that have performed Glass Pieces include the Paris Opera Ballet, Joffrey Ballet and San Francisco Ballet.[7][8][9] The former two companies and NYCB all included the ballet in their Robbins Centennial celebrations.[7][8][10]

Videography[edit]
In light of the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, Paris Opera Ballet released a video recording of Glass Pieces as a part of the Tribute to Jerome Robbins program.[11] NYCB released a 2017 video recording of the third movement.[12]

The Goldberg VariationsChoreographerJerome RobbinsMusicJohann Sebastian BachPremiereMay 27, 1971 (1971-05-27)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignJoe EulaThomas SkeltonGenreNeoclassical ballet
The Goldberg Variations is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to Bach's Goldberg Variations. A plotless ballet, it starts with two performers dancing to the Theme, followed by the variations divided into two parts, with variations repeated as Bach had intended in the score. Robbins made the ballet for the New York City Ballet, and premiered on May 27, 1971, at the New York State Theater.


Choreography[edit]
The ballet starts with the Theme, with two dancers in Baroque costumes.[1]: 400–401  It is followed by the variations that are divided in two parts, with two sets of dancers. The variations consist of solos, duets, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets and group numbers.[2][3] Author Deborah Jowitt wrote this part is ""more playful and experimental""[2] It features dancers in jewel tone practice clothes.[2] Jowitt described Part II as ""more formal, classical and mature.""[2] In Part II, the dancers add bits to their costumes, at first shirts for men, and breeches and short skirts for women, and later tutus and jackets.[2][4] In the final variation, when dancers in both parts of the ballet appear in full period costumes.[3][4] At the end of the ballet, the couple who danced the Theme reappears in leotards and repeat the Theme.[2]
Robbins attempted to avoid all narrative implications outside of the designs.[3] However, Jowitt noted that he nevertheless incorporates qualities he found in the score, such as ""pensive"", ""playful"", ""tentative"" and ""intimate"".[2] As intended in the score, Robbins included every repeat of the variations, even the ones that concert pianists sometimes skip. As a result, the ballet is about 1.5 hours long.[4]

Production[edit]
Robbins said that after working Dances at a Gathering, to music by Frédéric Chopin, he wanted to work on something less romantic, ""I wanted to see what would happen if I got hold of something that didn't give me any easy finger ledge to climb.""[3] He decided to choreograph to Bach's Goldberg Variations, which he viewed as ""very big and architectural"".[2]
Robbins began working on the ballet in early spring 1970.[4] He struggled with choreographing the ballet.[2] He said, 'It was like approaching a beautiful marble wall, I could get no toehold, no leverage to get inside that building. The first weeks of rehearsal were as if I were hitting it and falling down, and having no start over.[4] Robbins said that the large number of dancers is not the biggest challenge.[3]: 275 [4] Instead, he said, ""The challenge of Goldberg is that it's thirty variations all in the same key and formally all alike."" However, this also provide ""endlessly rich"" number of interpretations.[3]: 275  On the second day of rehearsal, Robbins snapped his Achilles tendon when he was demonstrating a step to the dancers.[4] As a result, he choreographed part of the ballet on a wheelchair.[2]
Though the ballet was set to premiere at the New York City Ballet's annual appearance at Saratoga Springs, New York, in summer 1970, the ballet was not complete.[1]: 394  Instead, on July 4, an open rehearsal was held for The Goldberg Variations.[1]: 393  The dancers were in practice clothes, while Robbins explained the ballet to the audience at the side of the stage.[1]: 394  The company then went on summer hiatus.[4] Later that year, Robbins was hospitalised due to hepatitis. He would later blame it for parts of the ballet he disliked.[2] It ultimately took Robbins a year to complete the ballet.[3] Allegra Kent was set to appear in an all-female quartet before it was cut.[2] Violette Verdy had also worked on the ballet but never performed it.[3]
Robbins was undecided on whether to use a piano or harpsichord until very late in the process. Though a harpsichord was used in Saratoga Springs, he ultimately went for the piano as he found harpsichord not loud enough in a theater.[1]: 393  The costume was designed by Joe Eula, and the lighting was by Thomas Skelton.[3] Charles Rosen contributed on the program note.[5]

Critical reception[edit]
New York Times's Clive Barnes praised the ballet, calling it ""a work of such amplitude and grandeur that it make you fall in love with the human body all over again.[5] In Ballet Review, Arlene Croce criticised the ballet, ""The trouble with Goldberg is that it doesn't exist as a ballet. When Robbins wrestled every last musical repeat to the mat, we don't come away with a theatrical experience but with an impression of endless ingenious musical visualizations.[1]: 401

Gorda is two-act ballet by the Georgian composer David  Toradze, first premiered in 1949 at the Georgian National Opera and Ballet Theater. Originally performed by prominent Georgian ballet dancers Vakhtang Chabukiani and Vera Tsignadze, Gorda was revived in 2016 by Nina Ananiashvili.


History[edit]
Gorda originally premiered on December 30, 1949, at the Georgian National Opera and Ballet Theater. A ""Public Hearing"" (the heading instead of ""premiere"") was attended by artists, musicians and choreographers; Vakhtang Chabukiani’s new performance was positively appraised and 30 December eventually became Gorda premiere day.
Otar Egadze and Vakhtang Chabukiani worked on the ballet libretto, based on Daniel Tchonkadze’s tale of ""Surami Fortress"". According to libretto, ballet was named Dardia, but the staging team decided to change the name and make more emphasis on the name of young sculptor. Eventually, the ballet was titled after the main character – Gorda.
By then, Vakhtang Chabukiani was already an acclaimed dancer and choreographer who worked on new ballets after his arrival to Tbilisi. Andria Balanchivadze's Heart of Mountains and Grigol Kiladze's Light were staged. It was clear that he aimed at staging ballets based on Georgian motifs, as he was persistent with the classical heritage.
Production design of the performance was by young Pharnaoz Lapiashvili; the conductor was Didim Mirtskhulava. Gorda's main part was performed by Vakhtang Chabukiani, Javara by Vera Tsignadze, Irema – IrineAleksidze, Mamia- Zurab Kikaleishvili. While first staging of ballet, Tamar Chabukiani's (Alalme), Maria Bauer's (Indian Dance) and Maria Grishkevich's (NegrosDance) performances were outstanding.
In 1951, the ballet received a USSR award and in 1957 a new choreographic version premiered (Gorda – Zurab Kikaleishvili, Irema- Vera Tsignadze, Javara - Liliana Mitaishvili, Mamaia – Revaz Magalashvili).
In 1973, a fire destroyed the entire repertoire of scenery and costumes. Several performances required restaging, including Gorda. In 1974, one more premiere was presented at Labor Union Culture Palace. This place eventually became haven for artists abandoned without a theater.
In 1985 new choreographic version of Gorda was staged at Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theater. Production design was by Ivane Askurava, conductor was Revaz Takidze; leading parts were performed by Zakaria Amonashvli and Nukri Magalashvili (Gorda), Ala Abesadze and Victoria Laperashvili (Irema),Lia Bakhtadze (Javara).
ZurabKikaleshvili was the last to restage Gorda in 1996. Leading parts were performed by theater soloists Vasil Akhmeteli (Gorda), Yuri Sorokin (Mamia), Lia Bakhtadze (Javara), Ketevan Mukhashavria (Irema). The last performance of this version was in 2002.
Since 2004, Nina Ananiashvili is artistic director of the theater. After appointment, she made important decision for Georgian ballet and theater- to restore Vakhtang Chabukiani's artistic heritage. The first performance staged was A. Krein's Laurencia (choreographic version by Nukri Magalashvili. 2007). Nina Ananiashvili staged her own choreographic version of Laurencia at Minsk Opera and Ballet State Academic Theater (2014). The following step was Gorda. New libretto versions and ballet choreographic version were created by Nina, who herself led ballet restaging works. Creative team worked on Gorda's production - Liliana Mitaishvili and Lali Kandelaki, Ekaterine Shavliashvili (assistant to the choreographer), Revaz Takidze (conductor), David Monavardisashvili (production design), Ana Kalatozishvili (costume designer), Jesper Keningsboro (production design), Studio ""Opio"" (video animations).
Leading parts were performed by theater soloists Lali Kandelaki, Nino Samadashvili, Nutsa Chekurashvili, Ekaterine Surmava, David Ananiashvili, Yonen Takanoand Frank van Tongeren.
In 67 years, David Toradze's Gorda is back to modernized, restored Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theater stage. It is first ballet premiere at renovated stage. The most recent Gorda premiere was held on February 12, 2016.

169,Graduation Ball,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graduation_Ball,"Graduation Ball , to music by Johann Strauss II , 1940","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Graduation Ball is a ballet in one act choreographed by David Lichine to music composed by Johann Strauss II and arranged by Antal Doráti. With a scenario devised by Lichine and with scenery and costumes designed by Alexandre Benois, it was first presented by the Original Ballet Russe at the Theatre Royal, Sydney, Australia, on 1 March 1940.[1]
The ballet is set in a fashionable Viennese finishing school for girls during the 1840s. The headmistress has invited the cadets of the city's military academy to attend a ball celebrating the graduation of the senior class. The senior and junior  girls have planned a series of divertissements as the evening's entertainment and are greatly excited by the event. Flirtations, exuberant dances, and a secret romance ensue.


Original cast[edit]
Besides the principal couple, Graduation Ball required a large cast of soloists and corps de ballet dancers. The Headmistress was played, en travestie, by Borislav Runanine, a character dancer with the company. The Old General, at the head of the platoon of cadets, was portrayed by Igor Schwezoff. As the principal ballerina, Tatiana Riabouchinska was the leader of a group of Junior Girls in a role sometimes known as the Romantic Girl or the Good Girl, and one of her group, Tatiana Leskova, took the featured role of the Pigtail Girl, a tomboyish cut-up sometimes called the Naughty Girl. David Lichine danced the principal male role as the bashful leader of the Junior Cadets in a role sometimes known as the First Cadet or the Shy Cadet.
In the divertissements, Riabouchinska acted as Mistress of Ceremony, introducing the performers of the following numbers:

""The Drummer"": a solo for Nicholas Orloff
""La Sylphide and the Scotsman"": a pas de deux for Natasha Sobinova and Paul Petroff
""Dance-Step Competition"": a duet for Alexandra Denisova and Geneviève Moulin
""Mathematics and Natural History Lesson"": a trio for Helene Lineva as the Mathematics Professor, Maria Azrova as the Natural History Professor, and Marina Svetlova as their unfortunate pupil, the Student
""Perpetuum Mobile"": a pas de deux for Riabouchinska and Lichine
Synopsis[edit]
The curtain opens to reveal a formal drawing room. Soon, groups of Junior and Senior Girls enter to inspect the premises and begin excitedly to prepare for the ball. The Headmistress comes to make sure that all is in order. The Old General arrives, leading a platoon of cadets. At first the cadets and the girls are timid, standing apart, but the Pigtail Girl breaks the ice, and the young people soon begin to dance with each other. The Mistress of Ceremony introduces the divertissements, which are interrupted by an ""Impromptu Dance"" by the Pigtail Girl. When the entertainment has concluded, the Headmistress sends her students and the cadets off stage, to have dinner.
While they are gone, the Headmistress and the Old General dance a ""Mazurka Flirtation,"" revealing their attraction. The young people enter and are delighted to find the elderly couple embracing. Everyone dances a high-spirited galop, bringing the evening to a grand finale. The ball is over. Everyone leaves. After the ballroom has emptied, the Pigtail Girl and one of the Junior Cadets sneak back in to see each other again. The Old General and the Headmistress have also re-entered to see each other, but their assignation is spoiled when they see the young couple. Thereupon, the cadet is led out by the ear and the Pigtail Girl is spanked off stage. The curtain closes.

Production details[edit]
During his development of the scenario for Graduation Ball in 1939–40, David Lichine worked closely with both music director Antal Doráti and designer Alexandre Benois. Doráti created the score for the ballet by selecting some less-familiar works of Johann Strauss II and weaving them into a coherent sequence. These included:

""Acceleration Waltz"", Op. 234 (Opening)
""Tritsch-Tratsch-Polka"", Op. 214
""Perpetuum Mobile"", Op. 257
""Flugschriften"" ('Pamphlets') Waltz, Op. 300 (waltz of the cadets and the girls)
""Feuilleton Walzer"", Op. 293 (Pigtail Girl Variation)
""Auf der Jagd"", Op. 373
""Feenmarchen"", Op. 312 (Sylphide and the Scotsman)
""Express"", Op. 311 (Finale)
""Kammerball-Polka"", Op. 230 (Finale)
""Une Bagatelle"", Op. 187 (Mazurka Flirtation)
and several polkas and galops merged for accompaniment to the grand ballabile.
Doráti himself conducted the orchestra at the premiere performance.
Benois, who designed the set for the formal ballroom and the colorful costumes, offered Lichine many choices, producing designs for a number of characters that were dropped before the final version of the scenario.[2] His costumes for the Junior Girls were white dresses with blue pinafores, for the Senior Girls simple party dresses in pastel colors, and for the cadets white trousers and blue military jackets with white sashes across the shoulders. The Old General was dressed in a red and white uniform with gold braid, and the Headmistress wore a matronly gown in shades of brown. In the divertissements, the Drummer wore a dress uniform, the Sylphide a Romantic tutu, and the Scotsman a kilt.

History[edit]
On 2 March 1940, The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the premiere performance of Graduation Ball received twenty-five curtain calls. It had been an immediate success. During the Sydney engagement and on the subsequent Australian tour, it was performed more than sixty times.[3] It was first presented in the United States by the Original Ballet Russe at the 51st Street Theatre in New York City on 6 November 1940, with Riabouchinska and Lichine in their original roles.[4]
After the Australian tour, some changes occurred in the divertissements. The ""Mathematics and Natural History Lesson"" was dropped, and ""Perpetuum Mobile,"" which originally consisted of a circus number for Riabouchinska and Lichine, was replaced by new choreography for the same dancers and two of the Junior Girls. Further, in revivals of the work, Lichine's original, innovative choreography for the ""Dance-Step Competition,"" consisting of single and double fouettés en tournant combined with pirouettes en attitude, á la seconde, and en arabesque, with different arm positions, was usually changed to less challenging, and less interesting, series of single fouettés, with an occasional double at the dancer's whim and capability.[5]
Graduation Ball became a signature work of the Original Ballet Russe and was performed countless times. Over the years it has been danced by many companies around the world, including American Ballet Theatre, the Australian Ballet, the Ballet della Teatro alla Scala, the Ballet Nacional de Cuba, the Borovansky Ballet, the Companhia Nacional de Bailado, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, London Festival Ballet, Polski Balet Narodowy, the Royal Danish Ballet, and numerous regional companies associated with ballet schools and academies.

1932 ballet by Kurt Joos
The Green Table is a ballet by the German choreographer Kurt Jooss. His most popular work, it depicts the futility of peace negotiations of the 1930s. It was the first work to be fully notated using kinetography Laban (Labanotation). It is in the repertoire of ballet companies worldwide, where it has been staged by Jooss himself. Since his death in 1979, his daughter Anna Markard has been responsible for stagings of the work.

History[edit]
The Green Table was created in 1932 for the ""Concours international de chorégraphie"" in Paris, in which Jooss had been invited to participate. The originality of the piece won him the first prize and marked an important step in his career. Choreographed between two great conflicts, the work is a sort of generic war, a set of circumstances that produce the same result no matter where or when they are played out. So Death bears the combined iconographic attributes.[1]
In 1932, looking out through the thickening hedges of Nazism, Jooss takes a less visionary path. The Green Table is concerned neither with the individual's struggles and redemption, nor with working out a nobler fate for mankind. Jooss dramatizes the way destructive impulses are released and shows us the consequences. His moral position is unimpeachable and he drives home his lesson in a series of stark images. Each scene works a variation on the same theme, like the 41 woodcuts in Hans Holbein's The Dance of Death. The idea is that Death becomes everyone's partner, effectively seducing them into his dance on the same terms by which they lived their lives. No decisive action, change, or resolution is suggested, and in framing the ""Dance of Death"" with the stalemated parentheses of a diplomatic conference, Jooss seems to say none can be expected. The expressionists found the Dance of Death.[1]
Through archetypal characters Jooss revisualizes human life as a function of a larger cosmology, an enduring and spiritual sphere where perhaps even war and death can be seen in a more comprehensible scale. Undiluted essences of natural behavior, these characters are stripped of temporality and individual preference. Today, even as we feel detached from their obvious artificiality, we recognize ourselves in them, in some epic form. People will still be able to understand them in a hundred years.[1]
Jooss left Essen, where since 1927 he had directed the Folkwangschule's dance department and experimental dance group and, since 1930, the ballet company of the Opera as well. He founded the Ballet Jooss, a private company which toured Europe and performed his dances, including The Green Table.
In 1971, Joffrey principal dancer Christian Holder was trained by Jooss for a revival of The Green Table,[2][3] and when Jooss died in 1979, the Joffrey Ballet held an impromptu performance with Holder dancing the role of ""Death"".[4][5][6]

Plot outline[edit]
Lasting about 30 minutes and subtitled ""A dance of death in eight scenes,"" The Green Table is a commentary on the futility of war and the horrors it causes. It opens with a group of diplomats (the Gentlemen in Black, portrayed by the other characters in the piece, with the exception of Death) having a discussion around a rectangular table covered with a green cloth. They end up pulling guns from their pockets and shooting in the air, thus symbolizing the declaration of war.
The next six scenes portray different aspects of wartime: the separation from loved ones in The Farewells, war itself in The Battle and The Partisan, loneliness and misery in The Refugees, the emotional void and the atmosphere of forced entertainment in The Brothel and, finally, the psychologically beaten and wounded survivors in The Aftermath. The ballet then ends as it began, with the ""Gentlemen in Black"" around the green table.
Throughout these episodes the figure of Death is triumphant, portrayed as a skeleton moving in a forceful and robot-like way, relentlessly claiming its victims. The dance ends with a repeat of the opening scene, a device the choreographer uses to show his mistrust in the talks of the diplomats; completely indifferent to the ravages of war, they continue their hypocritical negotiations.

Analysis[edit]
The inspiration for the ballet, originally conceived as a solo, was provided by the medieval Lubecker Totentanz, a sequence of pictures portraying different types of people dancing with Death. Jooss gave it a contemporary setting and added the political content, which reflected his and many artists' concerns during Germany's Weimar Republic.
He then worked closely with the designer Hein Heckroth and the composer Frederick Cohen to build the piece. Jooss, in fact, advocated a form of dance-theatre in which the choreography is dramatic and develops from a libretto (often his own). Choreographer, composer, and designer combine their efforts to produce a coherent work in which all the elements, in harmony with each other, convey the feelings and ideas more powerfully. This concept of a unified work of art, previously theorized by Richard Wagner and, in the 18th century, by Jean-Georges Noverre, was popular among German artists in the early 20th century. Examples are found in the visual arts, for instance in the work of George Grosz and the Herzfelde brothers, or in the theatre of Erwin Piscator and his dramaturgical collective.
The Green Table reflects a concern for social issues and the problems of that era (shared by many artists contemporary with Jooss) such as political corruption and militaristic policies. Its style, with its cutting irony, caricature, and boldness of language, has much in common with Expressionism, which flourished in the first decade of the 20th century. The cynical structure of the dance, for example, is a formal expression of this dry humour: the diplomats repeat their routine with total indifference to the real consequences of their decisions. The seriousness of their discussion is negated by the music that Jooss chose to accompany this scene: a playful tango. He also dressed the characters in masks, which gave them a grotesque look, and created movements that are exaggerations of naturalistic movement, such as gesticulating while talking, or nervously pacing up and down while thinking.
The costumes and props were chosen for their symbolic qualities: a flag for the hopeful soldier, a red dress coupled with a white scarf for the partisan, or the skeleton-like costume of Death. Jooss mastered the visual outlook of his compositions with skill; again the scene of the Gentlemen in Black provides an example of how the choreographer directed the audience to focus on a particular point of interest, which may be a dancer located on a higher plane than the rest of the group, or someone keeping still while everybody else is moving (or vice versa), or simply a convergence of the compositional lines.
His use of space for expressive purposes, as well as the foundation of his technique, stemmed from his formative training as Rudolf Laban's student and assistant. Together they explored the interrelation between space and the body, with its various movement qualities reflecting different mental states and feelings. Jooss integrated Laban's findings and his free-style approach to dancing with the discipline of classical ballet training. The result was a new technique that emphasizes the use of the body as an expressive whole. This technique was to be absorbed and further developed by Jooss' students, among whom were Birgit Cullberg and Pina Bausch.
The Green Table is a mature example of this technique. It uses elements of classical ballet, such as turn-out, demi-pointe, extensions, turns, arabesques, and other ballet steps. However, there is no pointe work or any other feature that could suggest virtuoso display. The gracefulness, elegance, ethereal quality, and other affectations of classical ballet are eliminated. As with the choreography of Antony Tudor, every step is used, not for its formal look, but for its intrinsic expressive value, and the meaning it conveys is often reinforced by the position of the hands: rather than the relaxed wrists of ballet, Jooss uses stretched palms, fists, reaching hands, and so on. The focus of the dancers also varies, shifting towards the centre of drama, rather than being primarily towards the audience, as in ballet.
The resulting style, called by Jooss ""Essentialism,"" tries to capture the essence of each movement or pose, its inner motivation. Death, for instance, moves with sharp, direct, strong, and angular movements, cutting through space, advancing or pacing with clockwork regularity. In contrast is the style of the Profiteer: he has a swift and agile way of moving, his back usually curved, his cunning nature further accentuated by the indirectness of his focus and his multi-directional spatial patterns. Such elements combine to make The Green Table a truly innovative work and the depth and universality of its humanistic content give it a timeless and meaningful quality.

Allusions to the Danse Macabre (Dance of Death)[edit]
Along with other German choreographers of the early 20th Century such as Mary Wigman, Valeska Gert, and Anita Berber, choreographer Kurt Jooss explored concepts relating to death. However, unlike Wigman, Gert, and Berber, Kurt Jooss directly employs the imagery of the processions found in traditional paintings depicting this ""Dance of Death"" or ""Danse Macabre"".[7]
As a result of the various famines, lengthy wars, and epidemics (The Black Plague) of the fourteenth century, the Dance of Death represented a collective Western (European) ideal of the inescapable nature of Death's dance with humans of any status. In many of the paintings and texts referencing the Dance of Death, the dance is depicted and referenced as some kind of linear procession - a line of people. With a personification of Death, a skeleton, in front, they lead the humans, dead, arms linked with one another, in some direction, mimicking a type of social dance.
In ""The Aftermath"", the last scene of Jooss' The Green Table follows six preceding scenes that illustrate war and its effects on archetypal humans/characters. After these characters - the soldiers, the loved ones, an escort, etc. - are fatally affected by the deadly effects of war, they appear and dance in a linear formation and resemble the processional nature of ""The Dance of Death"". In fact, Jooss referred to The Green Table as, ''Totentanz,"" a term that translates to ""Dance of the Dead""; furthermore, the German choreographer's The Green Table took inspiration[8] from a 15th century painted mural that employed the same visualization of humans in a processional dance with Death.
The traditional concept and subsequent depictions of ""The Dance of Death"" arise from historical mass deaths and were employed in order to evoke a sense of Death's inevitability, of human mortality to hunger, violence, and illness. Jooss, although he remains consistent with the themes of Death's inevitability and human mortality, expands upon the ideals already instilled in the traditional concepts of the Dance of Death in a manner that presents a lens of antiwar politics.
Following ""The Farewells"", ""The Battle"", ""The Partisan"", ""The Refugees, and ""The Brothel"", the physical manifestation of the Death's foreboding figure marches on stage to initiate the final scene: ""The Aftermath"". As he marches on stage, he is followed by the aforementioned procession of war's victims. As Death holds a blue-stained white flag above their heads, they slowly fall to the ground as Death's choreographic timing demands.[9] This scene solidifies The Green Table as one of the first modern political choreographic pieces when using the dramatic deaths of various types of characters - humans - to represent the inevitability of Death during war among various everyday humans while the caricatured Politicians continue their repetitive and futile deliberations.[7][8]
Kurt Jooss, influenced by the Dance of Death's visual component - the procession of the dead, expanded upon the traditional ideals of Death's inevitability and human mortality to create a choreographic commentary on the detrimental effects of war. Jooss's choreography claims that in war especially, Death's inevitability and human mortality are most apparent among various (all) humans, except for the Politicians who choose to start and end the war. They remain unharmed, nonchalant of, and separate from the procession of the dead.

1927 ballet by William Grant Still


William Grant Still in 1949, photographed by Carl Van Vechten
La Guiablesse is a 1927 ballet composition in nine-movements by American composer William Grant Still.[1] The ballet was first performed in 1933 
by Howard Hanson and Thelma Biracree at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York, and Ruth Page in Chicago, Illinois. The work is about nineteen minutes long.


Overview[edit]
A description of the ballet is presented as follows:

La Guiablesse (a patois word meaning female devil) is based on a scenario by Ruth Page which in turn was based on a legend of Martinique. The opening theme is that of La Guiablesse. This appears throughout the score, and finally in the funeral march at the end. The she-devil herself is introduced by an offstage contralto solo, a haunting, wordless melody. Sensuous beauty and dramatic intensity mark the music. It progresses from a fairly quiet and atmospheric beginning to a thrilling climax. The story concerns two young lovers, Adou and Yzore, whose tender love is interrupted by the appearance of the greedily sensuous she-devil. She lures Adou away from his village sweetheart. Then, just as he is past returning, the music assumes a horrible tinge as the beautiful woman turns into a demon, and like demoniac laughter it continues as she insists on claiming her prey. Adou, unconscious, falls from her embrace into the pit below.[2]— Catherine Parson Smith, University of California Press
Movements[edit]
The ballet is in nine movements as follows:

La Guiablessee PreludeChildren's DanceYzore's WaltzThe BearersPas De DeuxGenedarmeDanceLa GuiablesseFinal Scene
Reviews[edit]
Reviewer Herman Devries of the Chicago American noted, ""[The ballet] is far above the average ballet music ... both in quality of invention and in the value of its themes and imagination. It is a highly-colored, vivid, evocative, gorgeous score.""[2] Another reviewer, Stuart R. Sabin of Rochester, wrote, ""The music is charming, picturesque and dramatically suggestive, never padded, never divorced from the action, yet with an individual appeal of its own.""[2]

176,The Hard Nut,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hard_Nut,"The Hard Nut , Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky , 1991","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The Hard Nut is a ballet set to Tchaikovsky's 1892 The Nutcracker and choreographed by Mark Morris. It took its inspiration from the comic artist Charles Burns, whose art is personal and deeply instilled with archetypal concepts of guilt, childhood, adolescent sexuality, and poignant, nostalgic portrayals of post-war America. Morris enlisted a team of collaborators to create a world not unlike that of Burns’ world, where stories take comic book clichés and rearrange them into disturbing yet funny patterns.
Morris turned to Adrianne Lobel to create sets that would take Hoffmann's tale out of the traditional German setting and into Burns’ graphic, black and white view of the world. With these immense sets and scrims, lighting designer James F. Ingalls created a dark world within retro 1960s suburbia and costume designer Martin Pakledinaz created costumes that helped bring to life Burns’ world, described as being ""at the juncture of fiction and memory, of cheap thrills and horror."" The last of 10 pieces Mark Morris created during his time as Director of Dance at the National Opera House of Belgium, the piece was his most ambitious work at the time.
The Hard Nut premiered on 12 January 1991 at the Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie in Brussels, just short of the 100th anniversary of the creation of Tchaikovsky's classic score. Shortly after the premiere, the Mark Morris Dance Group returned to the United States, having finished their three-year residency at the Monnaie.


Plot[edit]
While resetting the ballet in a 1960s-style American town and costuming it garishly and making the characters rather cartoonlike (the toy soldiers are an army of G.I. Joes), the overall plot of The Nutcracker was rather faithfully followed, to the point of including a pantomime version of ""The Story of the Hard Nut,"" the tale-within-a-tale of E.T.A. Hoffmann's ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"" in Act II, to explain how Drosselmeyer's nephew was turned into the Nutcracker. This section is usually not included, not even in Tchaikovsky's original version. Princess Pirlipat is turned into a pig-snouted creature as a baby by the vengeful Mouse Queen, and Drosselmeyer searches the world for a way to break the spell, thus ushering the famous Danses caracterisques of Act II. The only one able to do so is Drosselmeyer's nephew, who, after biting a hard nut, breaks the spell placed on Princess Pirlipat, but is turned into a Nutcracker. Princess Pirlipat promptly rejects him, whereupon Clara (here called Marie) declares her love for him and the spell on Drosselmeyer's nephew is broken.

Alterations from the traditional presentation[edit]
The Sugar Plum Fairy is eliminated as in the Baryshnikov Nutcracker, and Marie performs all of her dances. Her relationship with Drosselmeyer's nephew becomes romantic at the end and becomes a duet rather than an ensemble piece.

Television airings[edit]
In the US the film aired on PBS stations in 1991 as part of the Great Performances series.
It was chosen the favorite by viewer votes in 2007, 2008, and 2009 in Ovation TV's annual ""Battle of the Nutcrackers.""[1]  Ovation did not include it in the 2010 competition.[2]

Commercial releases[edit]
The Hard Nut was released on VHS and Laserdisc in 1992 and on DVD in 2007. The DVD extras include ""The Arabian Dance,"" segment which had been cut from the film due to time constraints,[3] and Mark Morris's reflections on the original and ongoing productions of his version of the ballet.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Farmers dance
Harnasie, Op. 55, is a ballet-pantomime written by the Polish composer Karol Szymanowski between 1923 and 1931, to a libretto by Jerzy Rytard and his wife and Jarosław Iwaszkiewicz, the librettist of Symanowski's opera, King Roger.
The story is set in the Tatra mountains and is based on the legend of the abduction of a bride by the robber Harnaś and his band (the ""Harnasie"" of the title). Szymanowski first visited Zakopane in the Tatras in 1921 and studied the music and folklore of the Gorals people. The score makes extensive use of folk-song and employs a choir with tenor solo.
The ballet  comprises two acts, preceded by a prelude. There are only three principal characters: a shepherd, a girl and the robber (Harnaś). In the first scene, the shepherd is driving his sheep to pasture and the girl encounters Harnaś. In the second scene, Harnaś kidnaps the girl from her wedding. The third scene, in the robber's den, concludes in an epilogue with a lively dance.[1]
The ballet was first performed in 1935 in Prague. A year later it was presented in Paris by the dancer and choreographer Serge Lifar. There it proved an exceptional success for Szymanowski nearly a year before his death. The Polish premiere took place in Poznań in 1938.[2]

Ballet by Paul Hindemith

For the Hérodiade Ballet Suite by Jules Massenet, see Hérodiade § Ballet suite.
Hérodiade de Stéphane Mallarmé: Recitation orchestrale is a composition by Paul Hindemith written in June 1944  on commission from Martha Graham, supported by funds from the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Foundation. The ballet premiered under the title of Herodiade (but had originally been titled Mirror before Me) in the Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge Auditorium at the Library of Congress in Washington DC.[1][2] The premiere took place on 30 October 1944, sharing the program with Aaron Copland's Appalachian Spring and Darius Milhaud's Jeux du printemps (Graham's ballet title was Imagined Wing),[3] with Martha Graham and May O'Donnell in the leading roles. The choreography was by Martha Graham, stage design was by the Japanese American sculptor Isamu Noguchi, and costumes by Edythe Gilfond.


Composition[edit]
The piece uses Stéphane Mallarmé's poem ""Hérodiade"" as a basis for the dramatic narrative flow of the piece without using the more common fusion of poetry and music, a song.  Neither does the subtitle ""orchestral recitation"" imply an actual recitation of the poetry with the music as in a melodrama. This misunderstanding has led to some misguided performances and recordings. In a letter to Willy Strecker, Hindemith further confirms that ""The 'Hérodiade' is not to be spoken! The melodic lines in the orchestra ... are themselves the recitation.""[4]  Likewise, Hindemith did not set the text as a song because he felt the voice would be a distraction from the dance.[5]  He chose to give the melodic lines of the singer to the instruments of the orchestra, often giving the instruments rhythms that mimic the cadences of French poetry and the declamation of the Mallarmé poem.[6]  It is this that results in the subtitle ""orchestral recitation"" and not any intent to actually include a recitation of the poem.[5]

Instrumentation[edit]
The instrumentation is similar to Copland's Appalachian Spring, with the addition of oboe and horn and the reduction of strings to one on a part (as opposed to pairs):
1 flute, 1 oboe, 1 clarinet, 1 bassoon, 1 horn, 1 piano, 2 violins, 1 viola, 1 violoncello, 1 string bass.

Structure[edit]
The music is in one continuous movement but divided into 11 sections.

A short Prèlude in the strings, followed be a wide-spun melody with the full ensemble, ending with a wind instrument repetition of the opening phrase
A short string quartet
A longer section (Modéré), flute and oboe featured

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet by Malcolm Arnold

Homage to the Queen, Op. 42, by Malcolm Arnold was written as the official coronation ballet in 1953, commissioned by the Sadler's Wells Ballet in honour of Queen Elizabeth II, the ballet company's musical adviser Humphrey Searle having recommended Arnold for the job. The original choreography was created by Frederick Ashton. It was first performed by the Sadler's Wells Ballet on Coronation night 2 June 1953 at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, with original scenery and costumes by Oliver Messel. The Orchestra was conducted by Robert Irving.
Amongst the original performers were:

Nadia Nerina as Queen of the Earth
Violetta Elvin as Queen of the Waters
Beryl Grey as Queen of Fire
Margot Fonteyn as Queen of the Air
John Hart[1]
The ballet became part of the Sadler's Wells Ballet's regular repertoire during the mid-1950s. In the 1990s the Queen of the Air segment was revived.

2006 recreation[edit]
To celebrate the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth the ballet was revived in 2006. Apart from the Entree and the Queen of the Air, much of Ashton's original choreography was lost during the years, so new choreography was created for three of the sequences based on surviving material.

Earth by David Bintley
Water by Michael Corde
Fire by Christopher Wheeldon
Concert suites[edit]
The composer extracted a 17-minute concert suite, Op. 42a, from the ballet. There are also a version for wind band and a 9-minute solo piano version.

Ballet by Darius Milhaud
L'Homme et son désirMusicDarius MilhaudLibrettoPaul ClaudelPremiere6 June 1921 (1921-06-06) 
L'Homme et son désir, Op. 48, is a ballet composed by Darius Milhaud from 1917–18, based on a scenario of Paul Claudel. It was written in Brazil, where Milhaud had accompanied Claudel as a secretary when the latter was appointed ambassador to Rio de Janeiro.[1]
It was the passage of the Ballets Russes with Vaslav Nijinsky in Rio de Janeiro that triggered it. This was Claudel's first musical collaboration and he then repeated the experience several times with some major works (including Honegger's Jeanne d'Arc au bûcher). The work is also one of Milhaud's first ballets.
The score is written for four voices (wordless) and a small orchestra and a large number of percussion instruments (including a whip and a whistle).
The Premiere took place on 6 June 1921, with a choreography by the Ballets suédois under the orchestral direction of Jean Börlin. Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht.

Structure[edit]
The ballet is composed of eight parts played as a single movement:[1]

Scène I
Apparition de la lune
L'Homme endormi et le fantôme de la femme morte
L'Homme qui dort debout, oscillant comme dans un courant d'eau et comme sans aucun poids
Toutes les choses de la forêt qui viennent voir l'homme endormi
Danse de la passion
Réapparition de la femme qui entraîne l'Homme peu à peu en tournant lentement devant lui sur elle-même
La lune I a disparu la première. La lune II disparaît à son tour. Les heures noires se sont écoulées. On voit apparaître les premières heures blanches
A typical performance lasts around 20 minutes.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Horoscope is a ballet created in 1937 by Frederick Ashton with scenery by Sophie Fedorovitch and music by Constant Lambert.[1] It is based on astrological themes, and is reminiscent of Gustav Holst's The Planets in its musical exploration of the mystical.[2]

Background[edit]
Lambert had a strong interest in astrology and the programme note for the premiere by him how the zodiac determines the course of the ballet.[3] The story of the ballet concerns a young man and woman who were born in the disjoint Sun signs of Leo and Virgo. However, both have their Moon in Gemini, and they are able to overcome their fate and become lovers.[4][5] It had its first performance by the Vic-Wells Ballet at Sadler's Wells Theatre on 27 January 1938, starring Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes,[1] and it made stars of both principal dancers,[6] but particularly Michael Somes, who was described by one critic as potentially the finest British male dancer of the half century.[7] At that time Constant Lambert was conducting an affair with the young Margot Fonteyn, but they later separated. The ballet has been described as a symbolic representation of this affair.[5] Other roles were danced by Richard Ellis and Alan Carter (the Gemini), and Pamela May (the Moon).[1][8]
The ballet was praised by the critics: Francis Toye called it ... perhaps the most successful modern ballet that has been produced at this theatre for a long time. Arnold Haskell wrote: With Horoscope, ballet, now truly indigenous in England, readies a splendid maturity.[9]
Horoscope was to be Lambert's last original work for 14 years, during which time he concentrated on conducting and touring.

Structure[edit]
The full score was lost in the Netherlands, only nine numbers surviving. The Vic-Wells Ballet was touring there in 1940 when German forces occupied the country, and they had to escape hurriedly, leaving behind scenery, costumes, and the full scores to both Horoscope and The Wise Virgins (an arrangement of Bach's music by William Walton).[4][10][11] The work had had only 29 performances[7] and was never revived.[12]
The nine surviving numbers are:

""Palindromic Prelude""
""Dance for the Followers of Leo""
""Saraband for the Followers of Virgo""
""Man's Variation""
""Woman's Variation""
""Bacchanale""
""Valse for the Gemini""
""Pas de Deux""
""Invocation to the Moon and Finale"".[13]
Lambert had claimed that the theme of the Prelude was dictated to him by the ghost of Bernard van Dieren; Ashton suggested the tune for the Invocation to the Moon.[3] For many years, the music for Horoscope was known only in the form of an abridged concert suite of five numbers that contained, according to contemporary commentators, the best of the music.[4] The first performance of the suite was conducted by Lambert himself at Queen's Hall on 8 August 1938 as part of the Proms season.[14] Lambert recorded three of the movements (""Dance for the Followers of Leo"", ""Valse for the Gemini"" and the ""Invocation to the Moon and Finale"") in 1945, with the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra. That was the first recording of any of the music from the ballet.[15] In 1949, Lambert recorded two more numbers, ""Saraband for the Followers of Virgo"" and ""Bacchanale"", with the Philharmonia Orchestra.[16] The five-movement Horoscope Suite was later recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra under Robert Irving (1953)[17] and the English Northern Philharmonia under David Lloyd-Jones (1990).[18][19]
In March 2003, the nine surviving numbers were recorded complete for the first time, by the BBC Concert Orchestra under Barry Wordsworth.[10][20]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




A shipwrecked mariner
L'Île Enchantée (literally, The Enchanted Island) is an 1864 ballet by Arthur Sullivan written as a divertissement at the end of Vincenzo Bellini's La Sonnambula at Covent Garden.  It was choreographed by H. Desplaces.[1]


Background and history[edit]
Arthur Sullivan was the organist for the Royal Italian Opera at Covent Garden, precursor to the Royal Opera, under the direction of Sir Michael Costa. He had made a sensation at The Crystal Palace with his incidental music to The Tempest in 1862.[2]
In the Victorian era, it was customary for opera companies, when performing a shorter opera, to present a short ballet as an afterpiece on the programme.  As Sullivan was its house organist, the Royal Italian Opera looked to him to compose a ballet to follow its production of La sonnambula starring Adelina Patti, and so Sullivan's second major composition became L'Île Enchantée.[3][4] It was first performed on 16 May 1864, just after the composer's 22nd birthday, and enjoyed 13 performances in all, also appearing after Flowtow's Stradella, Rossini's Otello, Donizetti's La Figlia del Reggimento and L'Elisir d'Amore, and Verdi's La Traviata,[5] and it was presented in concert at The Crystal Palace in 1865.[6]
The choreographer, H. Desplaces danced the role of the Mariner, Mdlle. Salvioni was the Queen of the Fairies, and other dancers included Mdlle. Carmine, Mdlle. Navarre, Mdlle. Assunta and Mr. W. H. Payne.  The scenic designer was William Beverley.[5]
The ballet consists of thirteen different numbers that break down into a total of approximately 30 independent melodic sections.  A review in The Orchestra dated 21 May 1864 called the music ""unusually picturesque and beautiful.""[5] Sullivan's holograph full score was thought lost, although the surviving orchestra parts permitted a reconstruction of the piece in the 1980s.[5] Since that reconstruction, Sullivan's holograph came into the collection of curator and collector Fredric Woodbridge Wilson, who donated it to the Morgan Library & Museum, New York, in 1996,[7] and is now publicly available.[8] Parts of the music in the ballet were reused in several of Sullivan's later works including: Thespis (1871), The Merchant of Venice (1871), The Merry Wives of Windsor (incidental music; 1874),[9] Macbeth (1888), and his other ballet Victoria and Merrie England (1897).[3]
In June 1990, the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society Festival staged the first performance since 1867.[6]

Description of the ballet[edit]
On a sea-shore, satyrs enter and wake sleeping nymphs.  A storm frightens the fairies away and washes on shore an exhausted shipwrecked sailor.  He awakes to find himself on an island whose residents are mythical creatures.  He is enchanted by The Fairy Queen, who brings him to the magical fairy bower.  The sailor encounters other nymphs who test his faithfulness.  After scenes of jealousy involving the characters' former lovers, the Queen of the Fairies and the sailor fall in love, leaving the jilted lovers behind.  The Fairy Queen and the sailor finally kiss, transforming the Fairy Queen into a mortal, and she bestows her hand upon him.

Recordings[edit]
The ballet was recorded in 1992 by the RTÉ Concert Orchestra, conducted by Andrew Penny, for Marco Polo.[3][10] It was recorded by BBC Concert Orchestra, conducted by John Andrews, and released in 2022 by Dutton Vocalion.[11] Nick Barnard wrote for MusicWeb International:

Penny understands the Sullivan idiom ... but this new performance edges it out. ... In the intervening years Sullivan's original score has been found allowing a couple of brief extra movements to be reinstated and generally a more critical edition of the score to be created. ... The Dutton recording is in their undemonstratively sophisticated SACD sound made in the generous acoustic of the Watford Colosseum. The playing from both orchestras is neat and nimble but the BBC players are given more of an opportunity to shine. ... Conductor John Andrews sensibly keeps the music light and the textures clean.""[12]

Critique[edit]
Barnard also wrote:


[T]he music ... shows both Sullivan's strengths and limitations as a composer. L’île Enchantée was his first experience of writing a ballet. ... Part of the concept of 19th Century Grand Opera was the inclusion of a ballet. .... Given that the opera alone is a good two and a half hours, tacking fifty minutes of a new ballet on afterwards would test the concentration of any audience. The general acclaim the score received – it was performed thirteen times within the season – would indicate that the audiences [were] entertained. ...
The orchestrations are always effective, the melodic flow attractive and indeed often memorable. ... What it lacks – and what it did not really need in its original context – is emotional and dramatic weight. This is just what it says on the tin – a divertissement. [T]he music has little if any dramatic context – there is a storm sequence and a Scène de jalousie but otherwise this is simply a vehicle to display the dancing talents of the performers. ...  Mendelssohn is the predominant influence. Intriguingly there are little glimpses in the galops especially of the kind of nimble patter songs that would be such a key part of the Gilbert & Sullivan legacy. The music is always fluent, certainly enjoyable, skillfully and aptly written in a way that few if any of Sullivan's British contemporaries could match. But ... [a]way from the [Gilbert and Sullivan] operettas that have ensured his enduring fame Sullivan was rather too content to write in styles and genres that supported rather than challenged convention.[12]


A review in The Orchestra shortly after the premiere was glowing in its praise, calling the music, by turns, ""sparkling"", ""unusually picturesque and beautiful"", ""charmingly appropriate"", and ""bright and spirited"". Of the love scene between the shipwrecked mariner and The Queen of the Fairies (No. 5), the reviewer comments: ""The descriptive force of the music which accompanies this scene is especially remarkable.""[13]

186,Impressing the Czar,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impressing_the_Czar,"Impressing the Czar , to music by Thom Willems, Leslie Stuck, and Ludwig van Beethoven , 1988","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Impressing the Czar is a four-act, award-winning,[1] postmodern[2] ballet choreographed by William Forsythe to music by Thom Willems, Leslie Stuck, Eva Crossman-Hecht, and Ludwig van Beethoven. It was premiered in its full-length version in 1988 in Frankfurt am Main by the Ballet Frankfurt.[3]
The work's title is a reference to the Czar Nicholas II's lukewarm reception of Marius Petipa's lavish production of The Sleeping Beauty. Impressing the Czar has five sections titled ""Potemkin's Signature,"" ""In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,"" ""La Maison de Mezzo Prezzo,"" ""Bongo Bongo Nageela,"" and ""Mr. Pnut Goes to the Big Top."" Though the work has no continuous narrative theme, the ballet comments ironically and often humorously on the history of Western civilization and its economies of culture.[4]
The ballet opens with ""Potemkin’s Signature,"" which is a commentary on the culture and history of ballet. The names of the characters and the plot pieces are full of cultural references.[5]
The second section is the most well known. It is a stand-alone ballet titled ""In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,"" which was originally created in 1987 for the Paris Opera Ballet,[6][7] where it was danced by soloists Isabelle Guérin, Sylvie Guillem, Laurent Hilaire, and Manuel Legris.[4] The title of this section refers to two cherries which hang suspended over the stage. One of Forsythe's most famous creations, this work is in the repertory of numerous ballet companies around the world. In 1992, its performance by the Royal Ballet Flanders received the Laurence Olivier Award for Outstanding Achievement in Dance.
The third section, ""La Maison de Mezzo-Prezzo,"" features characters being auctioned off, clothed in gold, as a comment on the commoditization of the arts.[6]
The fourth section, ""Bongo Bongo Nageela,"" is full of energy and bewitchment. A large group of dancer surround Mr. Pnut, whose name headlines the next act and who is portrayed as a Saint Sebastian-type character complete with an arrow in chest. Their circling motion is comparable to a type of folk dance, though not of any particular kind.[6]
""Mr. Pnut Goes to the Big Top"" is the final section, bringing the ballet to a dramatic conclusion as the title character of the section blows a party favor toy and the lights go out.[6]

In CreasesChoreographerJustin PeckMusicPhilip GlassPremiereJuly 14, 2012 (2012-07-14)Saratoga Performing Arts CenterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignJustin PeckMarc HappelBrandon Stirling Baker
In Creases is a ballet choreographed by Justin Peck, his first for the New York City Ballet, to Philip Glass' ""Four Movements for Two Pianos"". The ballet premiered on July 14, 2012, at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, during the company's annual season there, and had its New York City premiere on May 29, 2013.


Production[edit]
Background[edit]
In Creases is the first ballet then-New York City Ballet corps de ballet member Justin Peck made for the company,[1] though he had already choreographed at the New York Choreographic Institute for several years.[2] He originally expected his first ""big opportunity"" would be Year of the Rabbit,[1] but was commissioned to make an expansion of a piece originally made for the institute.[3]

Choreography and music[edit]
The title of the ballet is a pun, a comment on the music and what Peck ""wanted to do structurally with the choreography.""[4][5] The ballet is set to Philip Glass' Four Movements for Two Pianos, which was composed in 2008.[5] Peck was initially hesitant in using a score by Glass as many choreographers had used Glass' music before, but opted to use it anyway because Peck believed it was ""very good danceable music"" and ""a little bit more expansive than usual.""[2]
In the choreography, Peck ""attempted to have the dancers consume as much space as possible, then moved on to how I could divide and fold or crease the space using the bodies of the dancers.""[5] According to Peck, the choreography is largely inspired by the score[5] and incorporates two scientific concepts: withdrawal reflex and the relation of magnetic poles.[3]
The cast consists of eight dancers and two onstage pianists.[3] Compared with the Choreographic Institute, the rehearsal schedule for a main stage production is far more unpredictable and Peck would only receive the schedule the days beforehand, therefore he ""was freaking out a little.""[2] While choreographing, he was also rehearsing and performing other ballets.[3]

Designs[edit]
Peck and Marc Happel, head of the company costume department, designed the costumes.[4] Peck said he wrote down his ideas for costumes and proposed different color palette options to Happel.[2] As there were ""no budget"" for the costumes, Peck went to the company warehouse, hoping to ""recycle or re-use"" old costumes, but he found it ""difficult, because everything looked either very dated or too current, and you could sort of recognize what ballet it came from.""[2] For the female costumes, he ended up choosing the leotards from Martins' Friandises, but without the skirts, while the costumes for men are from unused unitards with some modifications.[2]
The lighting was designed by Mark Stanley.[2]

Performances[edit]
In Creases premiered on July 14, 2012, at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center,[3] where the New York City Ballet performs annually,[2] during which Peck performed in other ballets, including principal roles in Robbins' In the Night and Balanchine's Brahms–Schoenberg Quartet.[3] Peck called the experience of watching it premiere ""nerve wracking.""[5] Following its premiere, In Creases was performed by the smaller touring troupe New York City Ballet Moves,[4] including at the Vail Dance Festival.[5] On the tour, Peck was in three other ballets, so he would watch In Creases then go backstage to get ready for his performance.[2] The ballet had its New York City premiere on May 29, 2013, by then two other ballets by Peck, Year of the Rabbit and Paz de la Jolla, had premiered there,[6] and Peck was promoted to soloist.[7]
The Joffrey Ballet in Chicago performed In Creases for the first time in 2015. It was the first ballet created by Peck for the New York City Ballet that was revived by another company.[1] The Paris Opera Ballet had their premiere of In Creases in 2016.[8] It was staged by Christian Tworzyanski, an original cast member who had recently joined Les Ballets de Monte Carlo in Monaco. Tworzyanski had never staged a ballet before, and learned the other roles via a video and speaking to Peck.[9] Tworzyanski has since staged In Creases for Ballet Austin, The Washington Ballet and BalletMet.[9] Boston Ballet and Ballet Arizona have also performed In Creases.[10][11]

Critical reception[edit]
On the world premiere, New York Times's Alastair Macaulay wrote that the impression of In Creases ""is of a dreamscape that heightens the progress and colors of its score,"" though it ""passes so smoothly that it’s difficult to remember after a first viewing just how these and other scenes all fit together."" Reviewing the New York City premiere, Marina Harss of DanceTabs called it a ""short, lively piece"" but ""[i]t’s not terribly surprising that In Creases is not as fully developed or integrated as Year of the Rabbit and Paz de la Jolla.""[6] Apollinaire Scherr of the Financial Times commented that the ballet ""invested the moment with the force of the future, and its own modest self with a vision of the art form: enough for any audience, new and young included.""[7]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



The Incredible Flutist is a ballet composed by Walter Piston in 1938, his only composition for the stage.[1] The ballet received its premiere by the Boston Pops under Arthur Fiedler[2] on May 30 of that year. The libretto, written by Piston and Hans Wiener, describes a marketplace teeming with activity and enlivened by a circus. A flutist acts as a snake charmer and also charms women. A rich widow flirts with a merchant, is discovered by her lover, faints, and is revived by the flutist's music. The circus then leaves the square.
Piston extracted an orchestral suite from the ballet, which was premiered on November 22, 1940, by the Pittsburgh Symphony under Fritz Reiner. The suite is in thirteen movements:

Introduction
""Siesta Hour in the Marketplace and Entrance of the Vendors""
""Dance of the Vendors""
""Entrance of the Customers""
""Tango of the Four Daughters""
""Arrival of Circus and Circus March""
""Solo of the Flutist""
Minuet – ""Dance of the Widow and Merchant""
""Spanish Waltz""
""Eight O'Clock Strikes""
Siciliano – ""Dance of the Flutist and the Merchant's Daughter""
Polka
Finale
Elliott Carter commented on how Piston avoided the use of a particular musical geographic ""pastiche"" style in the music, which could have made the setting specific to one geography, and noted that the village can be ""any village"" in this setting.[3]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




In G MajorChoreographerJerome RobbinsMusicMaurice RavelPremiereMay 15, 1975 (1975-05-15)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignRouben Ter-ArutunianErtéGenreneoclassical ballet
In G Major (originally titled Concerto in G, also known as En Sol) is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to Maurice Ravel's Piano Concerto in G Major. Performed by a cast of fourteen, the ballet featured Broadway-inspired choreography. The ballet was created for the New York City Ballet's Ravel Festival, which celebrated the centenary of Ravel, and premiered on May 15, 1975, at the New York State Theater, with Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins originating the two lead roles.


Choreography[edit]
In G Major is set to Ravel's Piano Concerto in G Major, which the composer said ""uses certain effects borrowed from jazz, but only in moderation.""[1]: 450  The ballet is performed by two soloists, who dance the central pas de deux that takes place in the second movement, and a corps de ballet consisting of six men and six women.[2]

Author Nancy Reynolds described, [In In G Major,] matching in spirit Ravel's unaccustomed ""borrowings"" from jazz (as the composer called them), Robbins produced a rather clichéd but nonetheless skillful and entertaining work, with a creamy-smooth central pas de deux. Particularly in the outer movements, both music and dance gave the impression of having been seen or heard somewhere before. In Robbins's extensive quotations of Broadway-style material ... he seemed often to reach for the too-obvious solution, possibly in keeping with Ravel's idea that a concerto should be ""light-hearted and brilliant and not aim at profundity or dramatic effects.""[3]
Robbins' biographer Amanda Vaill described the central pas de deux, ""Drifting and slow, it was full of hesitations: first the girl step toward the boy, then retreats; then he advances and retreats; when they come together, he holds her as she unfolds herself, becomes known to him, and their duet is full of parallel partnering alternating with beautiful exultant lifts.""[1]: 451 

Development and performances[edit]
In 1975, the New York City Ballet, at the instigation of co-founder George Balanchine, held the Ravel Festival, in honor of Maurice Ravel's centenary.[3] Modelled after the Stravinsky Festival in 1972, the two-week-long Ravel Festival featured the premieres of 16 new works. Jerome Robbins contributed four, including In G Major, originally known as Concerto in G.[4]
In January, Robbins approached Suzanne Farrell about dancing in In G Major. Farrell had just returned to the New York City Ballet following years-long absence caused by a fallout with Balanchine in 1969, and she performed with Maurice Béjart's Ballet of the 20th Century in the interim.[1]: 450  Despite being the star of the company,[5] previously, the only times Farrell had performed in a Robbins ballet was during her first year at the company, as a trumpet in Fanfare.[6] In her biography, Farrell attributed this to Robbins' absence at the company during the 1960s, only to return about the same time as her departure.[6] Robbins' biographer Amanda Vaill suggested another possible reason was Farrell's strong association with Balanchine, which she acknowledged, ""I think [Robbins] saw me differently because I had been [Balanchine's] inspiration. I had a history.""[1]: 451  Robbins paired Farrell with Peter Martins.[5]
Robbins often juggled between different versions of the choreography and different cast before settling on one. For In G Major, Robbins had developed the central pas de deux on Sara Leland and Bart Cook, before bringing it to Farrell and Martins.[6] Farrell was unfamiliar with this process and ""did not particularly like the audition atmosphere that was sure to encourage insecurity all around"", but also noted Robbins was ""polite, helpful, and accommodating"", and she enjoyed dancing the pas de deux.[6] Martins recalled Robbins ""constantly made clear how interested he was in us as dancers,  and that he had no ideal notion of what this piece absolutely must be like.""[5] On her overall experience working with Robbins, Farrell said it did not confirm Robbins' reputation as a ""supposedly temperamental and demanding choreographer.""[6]
In G Major, under its original title Concerto in G, had a preview performance at a gala benefit on May 14, 1975, before the official premiere the following day,[3] which was also Farrell's first performance since returning to the New York City Ballet.[6] The ballet was renamed to its current title in the fall that year.[3] The ballet originally used costumes and scenery designed by Rouben Ter-Arutunian.[2]
In G Major entered the repertory of the Paris Opera Ballet later that year, under the title En Sol.[1] The Paris production featured costumes and scenery designed by the artist Erté that suggested a French Riviera setting.[7][8] The New York City Ballet acquired the Erté set and costumes in 1984,[7] and continues to use them for the ballet.[4]

Critical reception[edit]
Clive Barnes of the New York Times commented, ""Where Mr Robbins has been especially adept and adroit is in fitting the dances to the weight and the mass of the music, and his sense of the music's structure is particularly pleasing.""[2] However, in her biography of Robbins, Amanda Vaill stated the reception to In G Major was mixed.[1]: 451

Ballet by John Cranko

Initials R.B.M.E. (German: Initialen R.B.M.E.) is a ballet choreographed by John Cranko to Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 2. The ballet is plotless, and features four movements, each with a lead dancer. The ballet was created for the Stuttgart Ballet, and the title was named after the dancers that originated the four lead roles, Richard Cragun, Birgit Keil, Marcia Haydée and Egon Madsen. Initials R.B.M.E. premiered on 18 January 1972, at the Staatsoper Stuttgart. It was one of Cranko's most successful ballets, and one of his final works before his sudden death in 1973.

Production[edit]
Cranko set Initials R.B.M.E. to Brahms' Piano Concerto No. 2.[1] Cranko choreographed the ballet for the dancers Richard Cragun, Birgit Keil, Marcia Haydée and Egon Madsen.[2] The four had been Cranko's close friends and muses since their early days at Stuttgart Ballet, and their dancing styles were instrumental in shaping Cranko's works there.[2][3][4] The title was named after the four,[4] in the order of their appearances in the ballet.[5] The ballet's costumes and sets were designed by Jürgen Rose.[1]
Initials R.B.M.E. premiered on 18 January 1972, at the Staatsoper Stuttgart.[1] In his biography on Cranko, dance critic John Percival described the ballet as one of his most successful works.[2] It is also one of Cranko's final ballets before his sudden death in 1973.[3]

Choreography[edit]
Initials R.B.M.E. is a plotless neoclassical ballet.[2][3] It features four movements, each with a principal dancer and supporting dancers. The four lead dancers appear in others' movements, but these appearances, according to Percival, are ""not necessarily to play any very active part, but just to be there, evoking the real-life situation where each was a strongly defined individual with a life or his or her own, but all helped and sustained by their friendship.""[2] He added that despite the technically demanding choreography, ""the underlying idea helped the performers to give it a sense of being more than just display.""[2]
For The Oxford Handbook of Contemporary Ballet, E. Hollister Mathis-Masury wrote, ""Cranko’s ballet was a complex mixture of boldness and hauntingly longing lyricism, interlaced with bursts of brio. This piece has the most complex relationship of group to solo Cranko ever produced,"" while the first and third movements, made for Cragun and Haydée respectively, ""are Cranko's strongest interpretation of this music in movement."" She added that the ballet is ""a vehicle for the individual dancing style of each of his four main muses.""[3] New York Times critic Clive Barnes noted the ballet was stylistically similar to Léonide Massine's symphonic ballets, though he believed Cranko had never seen them.[6]

Ballet choreographed by Justin Peck


In the Countenance of KingsChoreographerJustin PeckMusicSufjan StevensPremiereApril 7, 2016 (2016-04-07)War Memorial Opera HouseOriginal ballet companySan Francisco BalletDesignEllen WarrenBrandon Stirling Baker
In the Countenance of Kings is a ballet choreographed by Justin Peck to music from Sufjan Stevens's The BQE. The ballet was Peck's first ballet made for the San Francisco Ballet, and premiered in 2016 at the War Memorial Opera House.


Production[edit]
In the Countenance of Kings is Peck's first work for the San Francisco Ballet and his 28th overall. When Peck made the ballet, he was a soloist and the resident choreographer with the New York City Ballet.[1]
The ballet is set to Sufjan Stevens's The BQE, a suite inspired by the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway (BQE), with the title of the ballet taken from the first movement of the suite.[2] Peck said he made some of his best works to Stevens's music, and found it ""very inspiring on a personal level"".[1] The score was reorchestrated by Michael P. Atkinson.[3]
The ballet is performed by six principal dancers and a twelve-person corps de ballet.[4] Though it is plotless, the dancers are credited with superhero names, with the female lead dancers as Quantus, Electress and Botanica, the three lead men as The Protagonist, The Foil and The Hero, and the corps de ballet as The School of Thought.[5] These names were from The BQE and came up by Stevens.[5]
The costumes were designed by Ellen Warren and the lighting was by Brandon Stirling Baker.[4]

Original cast[edit]
The lead dancers in the original cast are:[3]

The Protagonist: Joseph Walsh
Quantus: Dores André
Electress: Frances Chung
The Foil: Gennadi Nedvigin
Botanical: Jennifer Stahl
The Hero: Luke Ingham
Performances[edit]
The San Francisco Ballet premiered In the Countenance of Kings at the War Memorial Opera House on April 7, 2016.[4] The Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle debuted it in 2019.[6]

Short film[edit]
Before the premiere of In the Countenance of Kings, the San Francisco Ballet released a short film preview, which features dancer Dores André daydream about the ballet following a rehearsal.[7] The film was made by Ezra Hurwitz, during the company's performance season, at an abandoned train station.[7] In the film, the dancers are in sneakers and leotards that are not the ballet's costumes.[1][2] The company had never done such projects before, and according to Hurwitz, the management was convinced by principal dancers André and Frances Chung to green-light the film.[7]

Critical reception[edit]
Allan Ulrich of SFGate called In the Countenance of Kings ""the most exhilarating company commission in years.""[4] DanceTabs's Claudia Bauer wrote that Peck ""refreshes ballet vocabulary with a youthful, urbane sensibility that's more Robbins than it is Balanchine, and specifically calls to mind NY Export: Opus Jazz,"" and Peck also ""devised Countenance with clever structures and cleverer transitions,"" though the music's ""frequent shifts in theme and extremely short arcs, causes the mood to swing too low, too high, too fast.""[3]

In the NightChoreographerJerome RobbinsMusicFrédéric ChopinPremiereJanuary 29, 1970 (1970-01-29)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesign
Anthony Dowell
GenreNeoclassical ballet
In the Night is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to four nocturnes by Frédéric Chopin. It premiered on January 29, 1970 at the New York State Theater, performed by the New York City Ballet.


Structure[edit]
In the Night features three couples, depicted at different phases of their relationships.[1] The first duet, set to Chopin's Nocturne in C sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1, shows a pair of young lovers.[2]: 390 [3] On the choreography of this section, Deborah Jowitt, the author of Robbins' biography, wrote, ""Over and over he lifts her or twines her through delicate balances; they separate only to rush together.""[2]: 390 
The second, to Nocturnes in F minor and E flat major, Op. 55, Nos. 1 and 2. Violette Verdy, who created the female role, interpreted the duet as a happy marriage with some drama to prevent it from ""coagulating."" Jowitt commented that this duet is ""more settled... with a hint of a folk-dance step, she always confident that he will be there to support her."" The pas de deux ends with the man kneel down to support the woman's arabesque, before lifting her up to let her kneel on his shoulder and walk off stage backward.[2]: 390 
The last is set to Nocturne in E flat major, Op. 9, No. 2. This duet depicts a couple that is about to break up. Jowitt described, ""Their dancing is full of passion and artifice; they’re being melodramatic for each other… One minute they are involved in flashy, tempestuous lifts; the next minute one of them rushes offstage.""[2]: 390  New York Times's dance critic Jack Anderson wrote, ""Life for them was an eternal cycle of quarrels and reconciliations. However, one suspected that, if they could not always live peacefully together, they could not bear to live long apart.""[3] At the end of this pas de deux, the two look at each other, the woman then sinks to the floor as she gently touches the man. He picks her up to a high lift, then as Jowitt described, ""drops her into his arms, and carries her away.""[2]: 390 
At the end of the ballet, all three couples briefly appear on stage together, before leaving for their separate ways,[4] with the men lifting their partners off stage.[5]

Original cast[edit]
The original cast consisted of:[6]


Kay Mazzo
Violette Verdy
Patricia McBride
Anthony Blum
Peter Martins
Francisco Moncion

Production[edit]
Robbins began choreographing In the Night in late September 1969.[2]: 389  several months after the premiere of his last Chopin ballet, Dances at a Gathering,[7] although he went on vacation in November.[2]: 391  In the Night is a followup to Dances at a Gathering, which McBride described as ""a continuation in the same vein.""[8] Robbins intended McBride's role for Melissa Hayden, who withdrew from the ballet. Moncion, who had been dancing with the New York City Ballet since 1946 (with the company's forerunner Ballet Society), had stopped dancing virtuosic and intense roles, so in In the Night, Robbins' made use of his charisma.[2]: 390 
The original costumes were designed by fashion illustrator Joe Eula, but were subsequently replaced by attires by The Royal Ballet artistic director Anthony Dowell. In the ballet, women are dressed in long tulle dresses, and the men in waistcoats.[5]

Performances[edit]
In the Night premiered on January 29, 1970 at the New York State Theater.[6] George Balanchine did not like In the Night, as Jowitt put it, ""he couldn't bear to see one abasing herself before a man."" Despite positive reviews from the premiere, the New York City Ballet did not revive the ballet the following year. In a letter to the company's co-founder Lincoln Kirstein, Robbins wrote that he was shocked ""because no one had informed me that you both felt it was unworthy."" Thenceforth, the ballet was revived by the New York City Ballet regularly.[2]: 391 
The ballet had also been revived by Paris Opera Ballet,[9] The Royal Ballet[1] and San Francisco Ballet.[10] At New York City Ballet's ""A Festival of Jerome Robbins's Ballets,"" held in 1990, six dancers from the Paris Opera Ballet were invited to dance In the Night in New York.[11] In March 1999, eight months after Robbins died, Paris Opera Ballet performed In the Night at a Robbins tribute gala.[9] In the Night was included in New York City Ballet's Robbins centenary celebration.[12]

The Invitation is a one-act ballet with choreography and libretto by Kenneth MacMillan, created in 1960 for the Royal Ballet. The music, composed for the work, is by Mátyás Seiber.
Featuring Lynn Seymour as The Girl and Desmond Doyle as The Husband, seduction and rape are at the heart of this piece which generated controversy at the time; particularly the scene of the rape. Lynn Seymour contributed greatly to the success of the performance. ""If the Invitation is MacMillan's ballet, it is also Miss Seymour's""  was written in The Times. [1]
The first performance was on 10 November 1960 by the Royal Ballet Touring Company at the New Theatre Oxford. It was first given at the Royal Opera House on 30 December 1960.[2]

This article is about Kenneth MacMillan's ballet. For Frederick Ashton's ballet, see Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan.
Isadora is a ballet created for the Royal Ballet by Kenneth MacMillan to music by Richard Rodney Bennett with a scenario by Gillian Freeman, based on the life and dance of Isadora Duncan.
In following the life of Isadora Duncan, the title role is taken jointly by a ballerina and by an actress, whose spoken text is drawn from sections of the memoirs of Duncan. Following the initial run at Covent Garden and performances New York, the ballet was not seen until revised in consultation with MacMillan's widow, and revived by the company in 2009. The scenario in the ballet concentrates on the dramatic events in Duncan's personal life and her relationships with four of her partners.[1] Set in the United States, France, and Russia, events covered in the ballet include her relationships with Paris Singer and Edward Gordon Craig in the first two decades of the 20th century, and the tragic drowning of her three children fathered by those men in the River Seine in 1913, as well as her marriage to Sergei Yesenin in 1922-1923.
The first performance of Isadora was at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 30 April 1981 with Merle Park in the title role. Designs were by Barry Kay.[1]
The ballet was featured in the 50th anniversary BBC programme 'Right Royal Company', in May 1981[2] and was filmed by Granada Television with the original cast and broadcast in 1982, subsequently being issued on DVD in 2011 by Odeon Entertainment, as the accompaniment to the 1968 feature film Isadora.[3]

Ballet by George Balanchine


IvesianaChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicCharles IvesPremiereSeptember 14, 1954 (1954-09-14)City Center of Music and DramaOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignJean RosenthalGenreNeoclassical ballet
Ivesiana is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to compositions by Charles Ives. The ballet premiered on September 14, 1954, four months after Ives's death, at the City Center of Music and Drama, performed by the New York City Ballet. Balanchine made several changes to the ballet since, including adding and removing sections of the ballet, and the final version of Ivesiana consists of Central Park in the Dark, The Unanswered Question, In the Inn and In the Night.


Production[edit]
Balanchine first learned about Charles Ives in 1934, despite his works being rarely performed at the time. Later, he attended a concert of Ives' works conducted by Léon Barzin.[1] While he was fascinated, he also found Ives' works ""incredibly difficult, far too complex for dancing.""[2] Years later, after completing a ballet to music by Arnold Schoenberg, Balanchine decided to choreograph to Ives' works. Balanchine stated that he found the rhythm in Ives' works most interesting, and also found ""the shock necessary for a new point of view.""[2] Balanchine was ""saddened"" by the fact that he never met Ives or tell him he planned to use his music, as Ives ""seemed inaccessible.""[2] The ballet is titled Ivesiana as a tribute to Ives.[2] The dancers were dressed in practice clothes.[3] The original lighting was designed by Jean Rosenthal.[4]
Ivesiana marked the first time Balanchine choreographed a major role in Allegra Kent, then a seventeen-year-old corps de ballet member, who had been in the New York City Ballet for two years. In her memoir, Kent recalled that she learned that she was cast the night before the first rehearsal.[5] She later stated she believed she was given the role because ""[Balanchine] saw in me the psychological raw material that could be molded and remolded into images of sensuality - unrealized and restrained, but there, just under the surface.""[5]
Ivesiana premiered on September 14, 1954, at the City Center of Music and Drama,[6] four months after Ives' death.[1] The performance was attended by Ives' widow.[2] The original version of Ivesiana featured six works by Ives, Central Park in the Dark, Hallowe'en, The Unanswered Question, Over the Pavements, In the Inn, and In the Night.[4] In March 1955, six months after the premiere, Balanchine replaced Hallowe'en with Arguments from String Quartet No. 2, with Patricia Wilde and Jacques d'Amboise, the principal dancers from Hallowe'en returning. In November that year, Arguments was replaced with Barn Dance from the first movement of A Symphony: New England Holidays, with Wilde and d'Amboise again dancing the principal roles.[6][7] It then fell out of the New York City Ballet's repertory, until a revival in 1961. Both Barn Dance and Over the Pavements were removed from the ballet. Additionally, In the Inn was rechoreographed. Instead of Tanaquil LeClercq and Todd Bolender from the original cast, Diana Adams and Arthur Mitchell danced the new version of the movement.[7][8] The lighting had been redesigned, while some of the costumes had since been replaced, resembling street clothes.[3]
The New York City Ballet rarely revives Ivesiana.[7] During New York City Ballet's 1978 spring season, Peter Martins' Calcium Light Night, to Ives' music of the same name, was inserted in Ivesiana, with the order of The Unanswered Question and In the Inn reversed, and Calcium Light Night performed before In the Night.[3][9] The ballet had also been performed by the Dutch National Ballet and Berlin Opera.[4] The Unanswered Question is sometimes performed separately, such as by the Suzanne Farrell Ballet.[4] Following Balanchine's death in 1983, the American and media rights to Ivesiana went to Edward Bigelow, a dancer and administrator at the New York City Ballet, as well as a friend of Balanchine.[10]

Structure and choreography[edit]
The first movement of Ivesiana is set to Central Park in the Dark, danced by a principal couple and an all-female corps de ballet.[6] In his book Balanchine's Complete Stories of the Great Ballets, the choreographer wrote, ""As the names Ives gave to his music so vividly describe them, I would hope that they also tell what the dance might be about... which is a meeting between a girl who is lost and a boy and how they become lost together, in the dark in a place like Central Park.""[2] Patricia McBride, who performed the principal female role of this movement in revivals, recalled, 'Balanchine told me to close my eyes and pretend I was a blind person. I practiced trying to find something as if I couldn't see. It's very difficult because it's just walking, it's groping, trying to really feel with your hands.""
The second movement is set to The Unanswered Question and features another principal couple and four men.[6] Balanchine did not follow the remarks Ives wrote for this score, instead this movement is about ""a girl all-knowing like a sphinx to whom a man might turn.""[2] Allegra Kent, who originated the female role, wrote that while the role is not technically difficult, she was ""definitely 'manhandled'"" by the four men. She also wrote, ""In this role I was manipulated - threaded under legs and pulled into splits - all the time remaining passive and inaccessible, The woman in this ballet ultimately represents the unattainable. She attracts and eludes the man who tries to grasp her. The mystery is never solved, the question never answered.""[5]
The third movement is set to In the Inn. Balanchine remarked, ""This is as informal as its music, with a dance by two young people. As the music echoes old-time dance rhythms, the dancers' steps do too. They act exhausted at the end, shake hands and part.""[2]
The fourth and final movement of the ballet is set to In the Night, a score that was described as ""a brief, tranquil melody with instants of unrest"" by dance critic Marcia B. Siegel.[3] It is performed by the corps de ballet.[6] Balanchine simply wrote that this movement ""must speak for themselves in the theatre"".[2] New York Times critic Jack Anderson described, ""Balanchine has a large ensemble cross the stage on their knees. And that's all that happens. Yet one gains the impression that these people may be praying, despairing or mourning, or doing all of these things at once.""[11]

Critical reception[edit]
Following the premiere of Ivesiana, New York Times critic John Martin wrote, ""It is strictly for the Balanchine admirers who recognize his genius and are eager to 'assist' at anything that he feels under inner compulsion to do. Here he has manifestly cut loose and allowed himself the full freedom of creation. Fortunately he has a company that understands him and is able to give him virtually anything he wants. The result will not please everybody, but it is honestly inspired and wonderfully wrought.""[12]
Dance critic Edwin Denby commented, ""Ivesiana develops no speed of momentum at all, no beat; it is carried onward as if way below the surface by a force more like that of a tide, and the sharp and quickly shifting rhythms that appear have no firm ground to hold against an uncanny, supernatural drift. Ivesiana is a somber suite, not of dances, but of dense and curious theater images.""[13]
In her book Repertory in Review: 40 Years of the New York City Ballet, author Nancy Reynolds summarized reviews of Ivesiana, and found The Unanswered Question to be ""the most arresting episode"", while Central Park in the Dark, In the Inn and In the Night were also well-received, but not Hallowe'en and Over the Pavements, the movements Balanchine eventually removed.[6]

Videography[edit]
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the New York City Ballet released a 2013 video recording of The Unanswered Question, featuring Janie Taylor and Anthony Huxley.[14]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Jazz Calendar is a ballet created in 1968 by Frederick Ashton to the music of Richard Rodney Bennett. The ballet was first performed on 9 January 1968 by The Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, with designs by Derek Jarman.[1] The work was performed over 50 times up to 1979 by the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden but is not part of the current repertoire.[2] It was also produced in October 1990 at the Birmingham Hippodrome by Birmingham Royal Ballet.[3]


History[edit]
The production was arranged at short notice to replace a new production of Aida, and at the suggestion of Nigel Gosling, Ashton asked Derek Jarman to create the designs.[4]
Richard Rodney Bennett's score had been commissioned by the BBC and composed between 1962 and 1964.[5] It encompasses a variety of traditional jazz forms and devices, from twelve-bar blues (in Friday's Child) to a fast jazz waltz (in Thursday's Child). Written ""for 12 instruments"", the scoring is flute, alto-, tenor-, and baritone saxophone, horn, two trumpets, bassoon, trombone, drums, piano, bass.[6] The music is dedicated to the singer Jean Hart.
The rehearsals for the ballet's premiere were filmed at the Royal Opera House involving many of the original principals.[7] The full score was recorded in 1971 by the London Jazz Ensemble conducted by John Lanchbery (Philips 6500 301).

Original cast[edit]
Monday : Vergie Derman
Tuesday : Merle Park, Anthony Dowell, Robert Mead
Wednesday : Vyvyan Lorrayne, Paul Brown, David Drew, Ian Hamilton, Derek Rencher

Friday : Antoinette Sibley, Rudolf Nureyev
Saturday : Michael Coleman, Desmond Doyle, Lambert Cox, Frank Freeman, Jonathan Kelly, Keith Martin, Peter O'Brien, Wayne Sleep
Sunday : Marilyn Trouson and cast.[8]
Story[edit]
The scenario, based on the children's poem Monday's Child[1] follows the sequence of the poem. After Monday (a ""hymn to narcissism""), Tuesday is a pas de trois in a style of Ashton's Monotones. Wednesday's woe is in the form of a ""distortion of the Rose Adagio"" from The Sleeping Beauty, Thursday depicts various forms of transport, Friday is a blues pas de deux. Saturday is a send-up of a male ballet class, while the finale mimicked the 'stage revolve' close of Sunday Night at the London Palladium.[4]

(Redirected from Jeu de cartes (Balanchine))
1937 ballet by Igor Stravinsky

Jeu de cartes (also known in English as A Card Game,[1] Game of Cards,[2] or Card Party)[3] is a ballet in ""three deals"" by Igor Stravinsky based on a libretto he co-wrote with Nikita Malayev, a friend of his eldest son Théodore.[4] It was commissioned in November 1935, written late the next year, and premiered by the American Ballet at the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York on 27 April 1937 with the composer conducting. Its European premiere followed on 13 October at the Semperoper in Dresden, where Karl Böhm conducted the Staatskapelle Dresden.[5]
The idea of basing the ballet on a game of poker did not occur to Stravinsky until after August 1936, when the story took shape. The main character is the deceitful Joker who fancies himself unbeatable owing to his ability to transform into any card.

Ballet by Claude Debussy
JeuxTamara Karsavina, Vaslav Nijinsky and Ludmilla Schollar in JeuxChoreographerVaslav NijinskyMusicClaude DebussyPremiere15 May 1913ParisOriginal ballet companyBallets RussesDesignLéon Bakst
Jeux (Games) is a ballet written by Claude Debussy. Described as a ""poème dansé"" (literally a ""danced poem""), it was written for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes with choreography by Vaslav Nijinsky. Debussy initially objected to the scenario but reconsidered the commission when Diaghilev doubled the fee. Debussy wrote the score quickly, from mid-August to mid-September 1912.[1] Robert Orledge has analysed the chronology of Debussy's composition and preserved manuscripts of the score.[2]
Jeux premiered on 15 May 1913 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris, conducted by Pierre Monteux. The work was not well received and was soon eclipsed by Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring, which was premiered two weeks later by Diaghilev's company.[1]
The first commercial recording was made by Victor de Sabata with the Orchestra Stabile Accademica di Santa Cecilia in 1947. A critical edition of the score, prepared by Pierre Boulez and Myriam Chimènes, was published in 1988.[3][4]
There are about sixty different tempo markings in the work, enough for Émile Vuillermoz to describe the score as changing ""speed and nuance every two measures"".[1]  The thematic motifs of Jeux are likewise very short, often two measures long or constructed from two single-measure building blocks.[5]  L.D. Berman has analysed Jeux in the context of Debussy's earlier Prélude à l'après-midi d'un faune.[1] Jann Pasler has analysed in detail Debussy's motivic construction.[5]


Scenario[edit]
""Venetian holiday in the 16th century."" Set design by Alexandre Benois for an unrealized production of Jeux
According to Nijinsky's Diaries, made during the weeks before his psychological breakdown, Diaghilev intended the music to describe a homosexual encounter between three young men, and Nijinsky wanted to include an airplane crash. The final version of the story involved a man, two girls, and a game of tennis. The scenario was described to the audience at the premiere as follows:

The scene is a garden at dusk; a tennis ball has been lost; a boy and two girls are searching for it. The artificial light of the large electric lamps shedding fantastic rays about them suggests the idea of childish games: they play hide and seek, they try to catch one another, they quarrel, they sulk without cause. The night is warm, the sky is bathed in pale light; they embrace. But the spell is broken by another tennis ball thrown in mischievously by an unknown hand. Surprised and alarmed, the boy and girls disappear into the nocturnal depths of the garden.

1967 three-act ballet by George Balanchine

Jewels is a three-act ballet created for the New York City Ballet by co-founder and founding choreographer George Balanchine. It premièred on Thursday, 13 April 1967 at the New York State Theater, with sets designed by Peter Harvey and lighting by Ronald Bates.[1]
Jewels has been called the first full-length abstract ballet.[2] It has three related movements: Emeralds, Rubies, and Diamonds (usually separated by intermissions). It can also be seen as three separate ballets, linked by their jewel-colored costumes. Balanchine commented: ""The ballet had nothing to do with jewels. The dancers are just dressed like jewels.""[3] Each of the three acts features the music of a different composer: Emeralds is set to the music of Gabriel Fauré, Rubies to the music of Igor Stravinsky and Diamonds to music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky.[4]


Costumes[edit]
The costumes were created by Balanchine's long-time collaborator Barbara Karinska, who created a distinct look for each different act: romantic, calf-length tulle skirts for Emeralds, fabric that flared at the hips of both men and women in Rubies, and the flat, classical tutu of the Imperial Russian Ballet for Diamonds. The costumes were such finely crafted pieces of art in their own right that some of them have been exhibited in museums and in theatre lobbies. Even Claude Arpels of Van Cleef & Arpels, who suggested the idea of a ballet based on gems to the choreographer, was impressed with her attention to finding the finest trim that would accurately represent the true glitter of genuine gemstones. Additionally, Karinska's painstaking work is credited with making the costumes last despite the sweat and strain of dancing in them. Her designs, needlework and choice in fabrics made them both durable and danceable, illustrating that the bodies inside the costumes were deserving of her utmost respect. When questioned about her attention to her almost extravagant detail she replied, ""I sew for girls and boys who make my costumes dance; their bodies deserve my clothes.""

Quotes[edit]
""It is open to doubt whether even George Balanchine has ever created a work in which the inspiration was so sustained, the invention so imaginative or the concept so magnificent as in the three-act ballet that had its world première at the New York State Theater last night."" Clive Barnes[7]

Awards[edit]
At the 2008 Laurence Olivier Awards, the Royal Ballet won two Laurence Olivier Awards for their company premiere of Jewels at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, featuring new scenic designs by Jean-Marc Puissant, original costume designs by Barbara Karinska, and lighting by Jennifer Tipton. This was the first performance of the full-length ballet by the company, picking up the awards for Best New Dance Production[8] and Outstanding Achievement in Dance. The Olivier Awards are the highest honour in professional British theatre and are equivalent to Broadway's Tony Awards.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Leonide Massine as Joseph in the ""Legend of Joseph"" (1914)
Josephslegende (The Legend of Joseph), Op. 63, is a ballet in one act for the Ballets Russes based on the story of Potiphar's Wife, with a libretto by Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Harry Graf Kessler and music by Richard Strauss. Composed in 1912–14, it premiered at the Paris Opera on 14 May 1914.[1]


Composition[edit]
Hugo von Hofmannsthal first proposed the Josephslegende to Strauss as a Zwischenarbeit (interim work) between Ariadne auf Naxos and Die Frau ohne Schatten. Composition began in June 1912, but in a letter of 11 September Strauss confided that the work wasn't progressing as quickly as he expected: ""The chaste Joseph himself isn't at all up my street, and if a thing bores me I find it difficult to set it to music. This God-seeker Joseph – he's going to be a hell of an effort!""[2][3]
Strauss drew on earlier sketches for his abandoned ballet Die Insel Kythere and wrote for an outsized orchestra with exotic instrumental colouring including four harps, large and small cymbals, four pairs of castanets, heckelphone, and a contrabass clarinet.[4]

Instrumentation[edit]
Josephslegende is scored for the following instruments:

Performance history[edit]
Strauss in London, June 1914 to conduct the UK premiere of Josephslegende
With Diaghilev as impresario, Nijinsky as choreographer and creator of the title role – replaced after his marriage and fall from grace by Fokine and Massine – costumes by Léon Bakst and Alexandre Benois, scenic design after Veronese by Josep Maria Sert, and Strauss conducting the premiere, the initial run lasted seven performances.
This was shortly followed by a further seven in London in June conducted by Richard Strauss (UK premiere 23 June) and Sir Thomas Beecham, who had loaned the money for the commission to Diaghilev.[5][6] With the looming war, Strauss never received his fee of 6,000 francs.[7]

Symphonic fragment[edit]
In 1947, Strauss prepared a symphonic fragment from Josephslegende for reduced orchestra.[8]  This was premiered in March 1949 in Cincinnati under Fritz Reiner.

Discography[edit]
Dresden Staatskapelle, conducted by Giuseppe Sinopoli (DG)[9]
Budapest Festival Orchestra, conducted by Ivan Fischer (Channel)[10]
The first complete recording of the work was performed in 1987 by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Hiroshi Wakasugi[11]

205,The Judas Tree,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Judas_Tree_(ballet%29,"The Judas Tree , Brian Elias , 1992","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The Judas Tree is a one-act ballet created by Kenneth MacMillan in 1992 for the Royal Ballet. The music is by Brian Elias. 
The first performance was on 19 March 1992, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.[1]
The only clue MacMillan gave in order to understand his intentions is a programme note quoting Kahlil Gibran's poem ""On Crime and Punishment"": ‘[A]s a single leaf turns not yellow but with the silent knowledge of the whole tree, so the wrongdoer cannot do wrong without the hidden will of you all’.[2]
According to the information at MacMillan's official website, this ballet is about ""betrayal and guilt, individual and communal"". The plot references the biblical betrayal story of the Kiss of Judas, which leads directly to the arrest of Jesus and his later crucifixion. In this same source it is said that MacMillan was also thinking of contemporary ""instances of betrayal, such as the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989."" Since the protesting students demanding democratic reforms were taken down by the Chinese army, ""in spite of politicians’ assurances that there would be no violence"".[2]
The Royal Ballet website describes it like this: ""The Judas Tree is MacMillan's final ballet, and still his most controversial. MacMillan commissioned a score from Brian Elias for the ballet, which had its premiere in 1992. Both MacMillan and Elias were inspired not only by Biblical stories of betrayal but also by contemporary events – the violence in Tiananmen Square; the creation of the financial district in Canary Wharf. As MacMillan admitted of the finished work, ‘There are things in me that are untapped and that have come out in this ballet that I find frightening’.""[3]
The current production of the ballet is staged in a way that is reminiscent of West Side Story. A single woman is in the presence of three main male dancers in a bleak urban landscape. Although it is not explicit in the choreography, the woman is physically abused at several points, raped, and eventually murdered by a wider gang. Although she is sometimes portrayed as a victim, she is not always a passive participant, but also wields what power she has to attract, rebut or humiliate some of her suitors. The narrative ends with one of her lovers being blamed for her death, and betrayed by a kiss from the real culprit. The man is murdered by the gang, and the culprit then hangs himself from the scaffolding. The programme notes recommend that this is not a ballet for children under the age of 12.

206,Kalkabrino,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalkabrino,"Kalkabrino , Léon Minkus , 1891","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


KalkabrinoMathilde Kschessinska as Marietta, 1892ChoreographerMarius PetipaMusicLudwig MinkusPremiere25 February 1891 [O.S. 13 February 1891]Imperial Mariinsky Theatre,Saint Petersburg, RussiaOriginal ballet companyImperial Russian BalletSettingProvence
Kalkabrino is a ballet in three acts and three scenes, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Ludwig Minkus. The story was written by Modest Ilyich Tchaikovsky.
The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Russian Ballet on February 13, 1891, on the Julian calendar (25 February 1891 in the Gregorian calendar) at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Its premiere was a benefit performance for its lead ballerina Carlotta Brianza, who had created the role of Princess Aurora in Petipa's ballet The Sleeping Beauty the year before.[citation needed]


Production[edit]
Despite Petipa's specific request for Minkus to collaborate with him for Kalkabrino, this work was not produced with the participation of Minkus, who would retire to Vienna later in 1891. Instead, the score was a pastiche of airs extracted from several of his earlier ballets, some of which had never premiered.[1] Kalkabrino marked the final collaboration, however indirect, of Petipa and Minkus.
The only part of the musical score still in use is the ""Variation of Draginiatza"" from Act II, which is used in the famous Paquita grand pas classique.[citation needed]

Original cast[edit]
Pavel Gerdt — as Kalkabrino, a fearsome bandit
Carlotta Brianza — as Marietta, a gentle flower-seller / Draginiatza, a powerful she-demon
Nikolai Legat — as Olivier, Marietta's lover
Felix Kschessinsky — as René, Marietta's father
Enrico Cecchetti — as Reuben
Marie Petipa — as Cigala
Plot[edit]
The ballet is set in Provence, France. The title character, Kalkabrino, is a brutish bandit and smuggler who desires the fragile flower-seller Marietta and tries to carry her off by force. She is defended by her lover, Olivier, who drives Kalkabrino off. Afterward, Kalkabrino is targeted for his sins by a host of evil spirits, led by the fearsome she-demon Draginiatza, who takes on the appearance of Marietta to torment Kalkabrino. Ultimately, Kalkabrino is dragged off to hell by the evil spirits to pay for his lifetime of wicked deeds.

Ballet choreographed by George Balanchine


Kammermusik No. 2ChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicPaul HindemithPremiereJanuary 26, 1978 (1978-01-26)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletGenreNeoclassical ballet
Kammermusik No. 2 is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Paul Hindemith's music of the same name. The ballet premiered on January 26, 1978, at the New York State Theater, danced by the New York City Ballet.


Production[edit]
Balanchine's last ballet, Ballo della Regina, was not challenging for the orchestra, so he told the musicians his next ballet would be set to a more complex score, Hindemith's Kammermusik No. 2, for solo piano and twelve solo instruments.[1][2] It features two lead couples, originated by Karin von Aroldingen, Sean Lavery, Colleen Neary, Adam Lüders, and a corps de ballet of eight men, which is an unusual feature. Therefore, the ballet had been referred to as an inverted Concerto Barocco.[1][3] The costumes were designed by Ben Benson, and the original lighting was by Ronald Bates.[3]
Kammermusik No. 2 was described by Balanchine's biographer Bernard Taper as ""one of the most ingenious and technically accomplished ballets Balanchine had made, and one of his least ingratiating.""[4]: 349  Karin von Aroldingen, one of the original cast members, called the ballet ""Kammer-computer"" as it is ""speedy."" She added, ""even the pianist can't play the notes. It took us forever to learn it. The movement is very angular, very fast. If you lose concentration for one second, you ruin it all.""[1] Sean Lavery, another original cast member, believed that Balanchine ""knew exactly what the corps were doing when the principals were doing something else. He was so fast, so in tune with the music, so ahead of himself, that we couldn't keep up with him.""[1]
Following Balanchine's death, the rights to Kammermusik No. 2 and five other ballets went to von Aroldingen.[5]

Performances[edit]
Kammermusik No. 2 premiered on January 26, 1978, at the New York State Theater,[4]: 418  with Robert Irving conducting and the piano played by Gordon Boelzner.[3] The company does not revive the ballet as often as other ballets.[6] It has been revived by Los Angeles Ballet,[7] Boston Ballet[8] and Louisville Ballet.[9]

Critical reception[edit]
Following the premiere, New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff commented that Kammermusik No. 2 ""confirms again that no other choreographer today works on the same high conceptual level as Mr. Balanchine.""[3] Reviewing a performance six years later, she wrote that it ""remains as startling and jarring as ever ... it will never become an audience favorite.""[10]

209,The Kermesse in Bruges,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kermesse_in_Bruges,"The Kermesse in Bruges , to music by Holger Simon Paulli , 1851","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Bournonville, 1841.
The Kermesse in Bruges, or The Three Gifts is a burlesque ballet in three acts created by the Danish ballet master and choreographer August Bournonville to music by Holger Simon Paulli, first performed by the Royal Danish Ballet on 4 April 1851. The Danish title is Kermessen i Brügge eller De tre Gaver.[1]  The ballet tells the story of three brothers who receive magic gifts from an alchemist.


Plot summary[edit]
At a church fair (or kermesse) in 17th century Bruges three brothers (Adrian, Geert, and Carelis) receive magical gifts from the alchemist Mirewelt. The two older brothers, Adrian and Geert, leave their sweethearts behind and set off into the world with their gifts (a sword and a ring) to seek their fortunes. The magical gifts bring disappointment to the two men but, back home, the brothers discover Carelis' magic lute brings happiness to all. Adrian, Geert, and Mirewelt are charged with sorcery and sentenced to death at the stake, but Carelis appears and his magic lute sets everyone to dancing joyfully. The condemned are released and reunited with their sweethearts while Carelis and Eleonore, the alchemist's daughter, embrace. Carelis' magic lute is locked away in a chest, to be taken out only at the yearly kermesse.

Characters[edit]
Adrian, brother to Geert and Carelis.
Geert, brother to Adrian and Carelis.
Carelis, brother to Adrian and Geert.
Johanna, sweetheart of Adrian.
Marchen, sweetheart of Geert.
Trutje, mother to Johanna and Marchen.
Mirewelt, an alchemist.
Eleonore, Mirewelt's daughter and Carelis' beloved.
Madame von Everdingen, a beautiful widow.
Music[edit]
The music is composed and arranged by Holger Simon Paulli, who liberally borrowed musical material from other composers and also from his own earlier works. To illustrate the young couple's love for one another Paulli lets Carelis, in the scene in which he is alone with Eleonore, play the romanesca, a 17th-century aire de danse, on the viola da gamba. Extensive sections of the marketplace scene in Act I are danced to various passages from Rossini's opera comique Le Comte Ory (1828), whilst the round dance in the same scene is taken from Paulli's music for Bournonville's ballet, The White Rose. In the scene set in Madame van Everdingen's home, music from Ferdinand Hérold's opera Zampa and Rossini's finale from his opera L'assedio di Corinto are used. Paulli's own voice as a composer is heard in the many dances, such as the pas de deux for Eleonore and Carelis in Act I; similarly, the obligatory final galop is a characteristic example of the dance music Paulli wrote for Bournonville.

History[edit]
The Kermesse in Bruges is composed of equal parts folk tale and contemporary satire. Bournonville's burlesque ballet about Flemish life in the seventeenth century was first performed in 1851, two years after the introduction of Denmark's first liberal constitution, at a time when Europe was in turmoil. The Kermesse in Bruges is, in its own way, Bournonville's comment on a period which had to learn to administer freedom. The alchemist Mirewelt cannot predict the consequences when, out of sheer gratitude, he gives the three brothers a share in his magic powers, but his three gifts quickly prove to be all it takes to turn the social order in Bruges upside down. The moral of the tale is that success in battle and love are short-lived gifts whereas the cheerful disposition will, as Bournonville himself wrote, always triumph and endure. There is indeed much cheerfulness in this Danish classic which also contains one of Bournonville's most beautiful dance compositions, the pas de deux in Act I, Carelis' declaration of love to Eleonore. This pas de deux received its definitive form when Bournonville restaged the ballet in 1865.
Later important productions are Harald Lander's and Valborg Borchesnius' version from 1943, where some scenes were omitted in an attempt to tighten the structure. In 1966, Flemming Flindt and Hans Brenaa made their own treatment. The costumes were in bright colours in the fashion of the day, but the performance also had a brush of something mysterious and medieval in the lighting and grouping.
In 1979 Brenaa created a new version, in which the ballet received a cinematic speed and a cheerful energy. This version was kept until 2000, when Dinna Bjørn, Anne Marie Vessel Schlüter, and the stage producer Jan Maagaard injected a serious shade into the cheerful lightness of the earlier production.
In 2000, Peter Schaufuss also created a version of The Kermesse in Bruges for his own company, The Peter Schaufuss Ballet.

210,Khamma,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khamma_(ballet%29,"Khamma , Claude Debussy , 1947","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Khamma (""légende dansée"") is music by Claude Debussy originally intended for a ballet.
It was composed in 1911–13, commissioned for the Canadian dancer Maud Allan, who was co-author of a scenario set in ancient Egypt. Debussy came to regret accepting the commission – he found Allan ""a detestable woman"" – and failed to complete the composition. The score was orchestrated and completed by Charles Koechlin in January 1913.[1]
The work was not performed in Debussy's lifetime. It was first heard in a concert performance in 1924 at the Concerts Colonne in Paris, under the direction of Gabriel Pierné. The staged ballet, which was originally to be called Isis, was first seen in 1947 at the Opéra-Comique.[1][2]
Khamma is set in Egypt, in the Temple of the Great God Amun-Ra in a town under siege. A young woman, Khamma, dances in front of the statue of the god to implore his aid for the town. After three dances she sees the statue move its head and arms, and ecstatically she dances wildly until a terrific flash of lightning and thunder at which Khamma dies. In the final scene the victorious defenders of the town find her body and lament.[1]
A concert suite follows the three dances of the second stage of the ballet. All the music is by Debussy, orchestrated by Koechlin.[1]

First dance: Sarabande
Second dance
Third dance
The writer Jean-Pascal Vachon writes that the work is uneven and austere, with muted orchestral colours and the dominance of the lower register, but is typical of late Debussy, with possible echoes of Stravinsky’s Petrushka (1911) and pre-echoes of his own Jeux (1913) in its textures and rhythmic organisation.[2]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Drawings by Karel Brozh of various scenes from the Petipa/Vizentini ballet The King's Command. St. Petersburg, 1887
The King's Command (also known as L'Ordre du Roi, or Les Élèves de Dupré) is a ballet in 4 Acts-6 Scenes, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music composed by Albert Vizentini.
The work was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on 26 February [O.S. 14 February] 1886, 1886 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, with Virginia Zucchi (as Pepita), Pavel Gerdt (as Pepito), Enrico Cecchetti (as Dupré), and Lev Ivanov (as Milon) in the leading roles. This was the last ballet to be given at the St. Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre before it was demolished in 1886.

Revivals[edit]
Revival by Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet, first presented on November 30/December 12, 1887 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. Principal Dancers:  Virginia Zucchi (as Pepita), Pavel Gerdt (as Pepito), and Enrico Cecchetti (as Dupré).[note 1]
Revival by Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet in an abridgement in 2 Acts under the title Les Élèves de Dupré (The Pupils of Dupré), with Riccardo Drigo revising Albert Vizentini's score. First presented on February 14/26, 1900 for the Imperial Court at the Theatre of the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia. For this revival many of the character's names were changed, including the principal roles of Pepita and Pepito to Violette and Vestris. Principal Dancers:  Olga Preobrajenskaya (as Violette/Pepita), Nikolai Legat (as Vestris/Pepito), Alexander Shiraev (as Dupré), Pavel Gerdt (as Louis XIV), Pierina Legnani (as Camargo), and Lev Ivanov (as the Count of Montignac).[note 2]
Notes[edit]


^ For his revival of 1887 Petipa added two new dances: the Gallarda, and a pas de deux titled ""The Fisherman and the Pearl"" for Virginia Zucchi and Enrico Cecchetti.

^ *Petipa's choreography for The Pupils of Dupré (his 1900 abridgement of The King's Command) was notated in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation not long after its premiere. It is today part of the Sergeyev Collection, which is housed in the Harvard University Library Theatre Collection.

The Lady and the Fool is a ballet, created by choreographer John Cranko with lesser-known operatic music by Giuseppe Verdi arranged by Sir Charles Mackerras. The story concerns the love of a poor clown for a society beauty, who finally rejects her wealthy suitors and chooses a life with the clown.


Background and productions[edit]
After the success of Pineapple Poll, Mackerras and Cranko sought a new collaboration, eventually deciding on adapting music by Verdi to a story by Cranko.
The piece was premiered in 1954 at the New Theatre, Oxford, with its London premiere at Sadler’s Wells Theatre on 31 March 1954. The two clowns were played by Kenneth MacMillan and Johaar Mosaval, with Patricia Miller as La capricciosa. The following year the ballet was re-worked by Cranko for Covent Garden, opening on 9 June 1955, dropping one character and reassigning some dances to other characters, allowing the action to be more clearly focussed and the characters more interesting.[1]
The ballet was later produced by the Stuttgart Ballet in 1955, Australian Ballet in 1961, Deutsche Oper, Berlin in 1962, CAPAB Ballet Cape Town and Royal Danish Ballet in 1965 and Houston Ballet in 1971. Performed on tour in Russia by the Royal Ballet, it was well received.[1] The ballet was performed at Covent Garden from 1955-1964, with dancers such as Beryl Grey, Svetlana Beriosova, Philip Chatfield, and Ronald Hynd. It was revived by Sadler’s Wells Ballet from 1965–67,  1972–77 and in the 1980s.[2]
The score was recorded in June 1955 at Studio 1 Abbey Road by the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Mackerras.  A DVD of this was released in 2011 (also including Pineapple Poll).[3]

Synopsis[edit]
Prologue[edit]
During a prelude the curtain rises on a dark street with couples on their way to a ball (music from Alzira).
A sad theme (Jérusalem) marks the entrance of two poor clowns, Moondog and Bootface who head for an empty bench in the street, where they fall asleep. On her way to the ball and beautifully dressed, La Capricciosa notices the two ragged clowns, wakes them up and asks them to dance for her (Alzira).
The clowns dance a grotesque divertissement; La Capricciosa is delighted by their dance and sweeps them both along with her to the ball.

Act 1[edit]
In a splendid reception room at the palace of Signor Midas guests arrive (music from Il finto Stanislao and Giovanna d'Arco). Signor Midas greets everyone, welcomes the entrance of the dashing Capitano Adoncino (Il finto Stanislao, Aroldo, Les vêpres siciliennes) and the romantic Prince of Arroganza. The host and his guests are pursued by two debutantes looking for a rich husband, but the men eagerly await the arrival of La Capricciosa. At the height of a tarantella, a fanfare announces her arrival, and she dances a brilliant solo (I due Foscari) and introduces the two clowns, who then perform for the guests, with a scene based on a quarrel over a rose (Il finto Stanislao, Aroldo).
An off-stage band summons the guests to dance, leaving the masked La Capricciosa with her three suitors (Ernani).They at first dance together (I due Foscari) then one by one the men tears a mask from her face – only to reveal another mask underneath; first Midas (Ernani, I masnadieri), then the Prince (I masnadieri, Macbeth, I due Foscari) and finally Adoncino (Macbeth, Attila), but they are rejected, and retire.
Alone, La Capricciosa removes her final mask, and at that moment Moondog enters and falls instantly in love with her (Attila). The off-stage band strikes up again and all re-enter, leading to several dances for Midas (Jérusalem), the Prince (Ernani, I Lombardi alla prima crociata) the husband-hunting debutantes (Il finto Stanislao, Oberto), Adoncino, with a pas de cinq to finish (Jérusalem, Attila).
La Capricciosa enters, soon followed by Moondog (Les vêpres siciliennes) who makes passionate advances to her. She eventually allows her love to overwhelm her and they dance a pas de deux (Aroldo, I masnadieri).
After an ensemble in which Bootface tries to attracts the debutantes (Ernani, I Lombardi alla prima crociata, Les vêpres siciliennes), La Capricciosa enters. Despite the pleas of her three suitors, she points out Moondog, and they embrace to the horror of the guests who leave the room (Aroldo, Luisa Miller). La Capricciosa helps Moondog to his feet and they slowly go off, leaving a disconsolate Bootface; but they return and take him with them (Ernani, Aroldo).

Epilogue[edit]
In the final scene, back in the street, all three curl up to sleep on the bench (Jérusalem, Aroldo).[4]

The Lady in the Ice is a 1953 ballet composed by Jean-Michel Damase, choreographed by Roland Petit, and directed by Orson Welles, based on an idea by Welles. Welles also wrote the libretto and was the ballet's costume and set designer. Richard Negri was the assistant designer. It was Welles's only attempt at a ballet.
The ballet was staged by the Ballet de Paris, premiering on 7 September 1953 at the Stoll Theatre in London. The cast included Colette Marchand, Georges Reich, and Joe Milan. Later in 1953 the ballet was produced by Petit in Paris, as Une femme dans la glace. Welles discussed the production with Peter Bogdanovich in the book This Is Orson Welles:

It was very successful in London, and only moderately so in Paris, where it was very badly lit — as everything always is in Paris. The plot is: a girl's been found, like dinosaurs have been found, in a block of ice. And she's on display in a sort of carnival. A young man falls in love with her, and his love melts the ice. And when she kisses him, he turns to ice. A little parable for our times.[1]

Lamentation is a modern dance solo choreographed by Martha Graham to Zoltán Kodály's 1910 Piano Piece, Op. 3, No. 2.[1] One of Graham's signature works, it premiered on January 8, 1930 at Maxine Elliott's Theatre in New York City. The performance was part of a concert staged by the Dance Repertory Theatre, a group that included dancer/choreographers Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris. Their stated goal was ""to give annually a season of continuous dance programs which will be representative of the art of dance in America and will give native artists an outlet for their creative work.""[2]


Theme and structure[edit]
In program notes, Lamentation was subtitled Dance of Sorrow, ""not the sorrow of specific person, time or place but the personification of grief itself.""[3] The ballet is less than four minutes in length. It opens on a set containing a single low bench upon which the soloist sits, feet and lower legs in a wide second position. She wears a loose purple tube-like garment from which only her head, hands and feet protrude.[1] Graham said of the costume, ""I wear a long tube of material to indicate the tragedy that obsesses the body, the ability to stretch inside your own skin, to witness and test the perimeters and boundaries of grief.""[4]
As the piece begins, the dancer shakes her head gently from side to side in silence. After cueing the music with a movement of her foot,[1] she rocks and twists her upper body, swinging through deep contractions. The angular motions of torso, head and arms become increasingly exaggerated, shaping the jersey costume into squares, triangles and rhomboids that frame her emotionless face and a portion of her chest. Seemingly anchored to the bench, she ultimately struggles to an upright position. In a final gesture, she clutches the upper edge of her costume in an upraised fist, stretching the fabric tautly over her head and face. She sinks once again to a seated position and drops her head between her knees in resignation.[5]

Critical reception[edit]
Lamentation has been praised highly since its premiere. In 1930, the critic for Dance Magazine described the work as ""a statuesque composition, which relied for much of its eloquence upon an ingenious and simple costume arrangement.""[2] After seeing a later performance, the Philadelphia Record's critic wrote, ""When Miss Graham in her Lamentation depicts the dumb agony of grief she does not droop like a flower or attitudinize like Patience on a monument, she is grief from the first stricken bewildered gropings of her head and torso to the last moment when she averts her covered head with a finality that is pitiful and terrible.""[2]

Critical analysis[edit]
Graham, her followers and critics have discussed Lamentation at length.[1] It is one of the last dances made during what Graham referred to as her ""long woolens"" period, early works for which she costumed herself and female troupe members in stretch jersey.[6] Graham scholars place the piece within her oeuvre of psychological expressionist ballets[7] alongside Errand into the Maze, Night Journey, Dark Meadow and others.[8]
Lamentation has been characterized as a total break with the conventions of dance at the time. Critic Marcia Siegel wrote, ""Our idea of dancing includes some picture of a person on his feet."" Not only is the work performed sitting down, the soloist is shrouded in constraining garb that not only limits her movements, but also hides her body from the audience. ""What she achieved by restricting herself in this fashion was an unnaturally intense concentration on the body's dynamics.""It's not just that she makes herself into an odd shape, but the minute she starts to move, the tube gets pulled into diagonals that cross the center of her body; as she tugs asymmetrically in opposition to the rounded forms of her back, her head, her arching rib cage, the jersey converts the energy of stress and distortion into visible shapes and lines.""[9]
Graham's inspiration for the piece reportedly came from the Old Testament Book of Lamentations, which begins ""How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! How is she become as a widow.""[10] The work may also include New Testament references. The lone shrouded female figure bathed in blue stage lighting has been interpreted as a holy person, perhaps the Virgin Mary as Mater Dolorosa.[1]
To dance writer Helen Thomas, the solo has a maternal quality that suggests ""the struggle of birth"" for both mother and child. As the dancer rocks and twists with knees apart, her arms and legs strain against the fabric to resemble fetal movement within a pregnant belly. She ""is also the child being born: her limbs are encased in an elastic sheath; they push and stretch outward, straining toward release, with only the head visible.""[10]

Performance history[edit]
Lamentation is one of a handful of early works that have remained in the Martha Graham Dance Company repertoire.[7] Troupe members who have appeared in the piece include Janet Eilber, Christine Dakin, Terese Capucilli, Peggy Lyman, Joyce Herring, Katherine Crockett, and Natasha M. Diamond-Walker. Films of Graham performing were made in the 1930s, exact date unknown, and in 1943. A film of Peggy Lyman performing with an introduction by Graham was made for television in 1976.[11] Ms. Diamond-Walker's performance was broadcast by New York City Center on October 21, 2020, remaining accessible through November 1, 2020.[12]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet
Laurencia is a ballet created by Vakhtang Chabukiani to music by Alexander Krein, based on Lope de Vega's Fuenteovejuna. Created at a time when ""choreodrama"" was considered in the Soviet Union the only acceptable form of contemporary ballet, it harks back to a genuine drama, wherein movement was a vehicle for meaning, and dance could serve as divertissement as well as dramatic purpose. At the same time, the story of a peasant revolution was obviously the ideal subject for a Soviet ballet. 
Vakhtang Chabukiani was one of the first to create a new choreographic language by means of his own particular blend of folk dance and classical dance. He asserted once and for all the importance of male dance, furthering in particular the notion of ""heroic"" male dance.


Performance history[edit]
Laurencia was premiered on 22 March 1939 at the Kirov Opera and Ballet Theatre. Soliko Virsaladze designed the scenery and costumes. The leading parts were performed by Natalia Dudinskaya (Laurencia), Vakhtang Chabukiani (Frondoso), Elene Chikvaidze (Jacinta), Mikhail Dudko (Commander) and Tatiana Vecheslova (Pascuala). On 14 November 1948, it was staged at the Tbilisi Z. Paliashvili Opera and Ballet State Theatre. Georgian prima ballerina Vera Tsignadze, famous for her distinguished and unique technical style, performed the title role. In 1956 the ballet was staged at the Bolshoi Theatre. Here Vakhtang Chabukiani partnered Maya Plisetskaya.
Laurencia had great success everywhere it was performed – in the former USSR and other countries. In 1979 Vakhtang Chabukiani again revived the ballet for the Tbilisi State Opera and Ballet theatre. I. Askurava designed the scenery and costumes. Irina Jandieri (Premiere), Marina Alexidze, Natalia Papinashvili, Vladimir Djouloukhadze (Premiere), Rusudan Abashidze, Svetlana Gochiashvili, Valeri Abuladze, Zakharia Amonashvili,  Nukri Magalashvili, Nugzar Makhateli, and Sergei Tereschenko performed the leading roles.[1]

Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
Scene 1

In Fuente Ovejuna, a village in Spain, a holiday crowd has gathered on the main square. Locals dance, while waiting for the return of their Commander from the battle. Youngsters are teasing Laurencia and Frondoso, who is in love with her. Laurencia teases Frondoso herself. Mengo, the violin player, enters and Laurencia’s friend, Pascuala, asks him to play the violin. Young people dance again. Military music is heard from afar. The Commander enters and the villagers salute him obediently, but he does not respond to their greetings. The charming Laurencia has caught his attention. The Commander courts the girl, but she responds with indifference. He loses his temper and, furious, leaves the village with his soldiers.
Scene 2

Bank of the river. Frondoso reveals his feelings to Laurencia, but the girl does not give him a clear answer. The sound of a trumpet can be heard. This is the hunting party of the Commander. He enters and tries to abduct Laurencia, but Frondoso defends the girl bravely from her loathed admirer. The Commander swears to seek revenge on them both. Village girls, more interested in chatting and dance than their work, take laundry to the river. Here comes the merry violin player Mengo, too. The girls meet him with joy. After their work is done, the girls return to the village, but Jacinta is kept behind with her laundry. Suddenly the Commander’s soldiers appear and attack her. Mengo defends the girl from the soldiers fearlessly. When the Commander enters, he orders his men to arrest Mengo and punish him. Jacinta is given into the hands of the soldiers. Laurencia is certain of Frondoso’s bravery, love and devotion now, and gives him her consent to marry.
Act II[edit]
Scene 3    

The whole village celebrates the wedding of Laurencia and Frondoso. Merry dances succeed one another to everyone’s delight, but the festivities halt abruptly when the fierce Commander enters the square. He is here to exercise his power, ordering the soldiers to put Frondoso in prison and to take Laurencia to his castle. The fury of the villagers is overwhelming.
Scene 4

The men of the village gather in a forest. They know that it is necessary to fight against the tyranny of the Commander, but are too afraid of him. They stand, lost in fear and despair, and only curse the tyrant. A tormented Laurencia enters. Her heart is burning with feelings of rightful vengeance. She shames the village men for their fear and calls for rebellion. Her passionate voice wins over the locals. Even the village women are ready to fight together with her. People armed with knives, sickles and spears, rush to the castle of the Commander.
Scene 5

Villagers break into the Commander’s castle. They free Frondoso and kill the tyrant. The people celebrate their victory.

Scene from the 2001 production
Leyli and Majnun (Azerbaijani: Leyli və Məcnun) a classic Azerbaijani story of love couple;[1] it is a one-act ballet by Azerbaijani composer Gara Garayev. The libretto is based on Nizami Ganjavi's poem Layla and Majnun[2] (the third book of the Khamsa, 12th century). The choreographer of the original production was Nelya Nazirova. The premiere, conducted by R. D. Abdullayev, took place on 25 May 1969 at the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater in Baku, with V. N. Pletnev as Majnun and T. N. Mamedova as Leyli. Nazirova's production was the basis of the ballet film In the World of Legends that was filmed by the creative association Ekran in 1975.
In 2001, choreographer Georgy Aleksidze carried out a new production of Leyli and Majnun. The performance took place on 17 February (soloists R. Iskenderov and G. Mirzayev), and on 4 December of the same year the ballet was shown on the stage of the Bolshoi Theater, during a tour in Moscow.[3]

Classical story of Leyla and Majnu[edit]

The parents of both Leyli and Majnun were not pleased with their love, so both of two lovers were separated, Leyli was married forcefully with another man, but she remained in obsessions of Majnun all the day, whereas, Majnu, due to the tragic separation from his beloved, retreats and go to the jungle, He prefers the company of the wild animals rather than that of men. There he communicates with the wild beasts and recites his poetry for Leyli. He becomes exhausted due to shunning the all bodily and psychological desires, his health continually declines and eventually Majnu dies in the wild. 
Although, both the lover doesn't meet in the life, but they are reunited after their death.

Liebeslieder WalzerChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicJohannes BrahmsPremiere12 November 1960 (1960-11-12)New York City CenterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignDavid HaysBarbara KarinskaGenreNeoclassical ballet
Liebeslieder Walzer is a two-part neoclassical ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Johannes Brahms' Liebeslieder Waltzes, Op. 52 and Neue Liebeslieder, Op. 65, with original sets and lighting designed by David Hays, and costumes designed by Barbara Karinska. The ballet premiered on 12 November 1960 at the New York City Center, performed by the New York City Ballet.[1][2]


Structure and analysis[edit]
In the first part of Liebeslieder Walzer, which features 18 songs,[3] is set in a ballroom, with the women are dressed in satin ballroom dresses and heels, while the men wears tailcoats, dancing ballroom waltz.[4][5][6] Following a brief break with the curtains lowered,[1] the women switch to romantic tutus and pointe shoes,[5] while the men only take off the gloves. The doors are opened and showed the sky.[7] This section's style resemble classical ballet[5] The dancers eventually exit the stage,[8] before returning two by two,[9] in the costumes from the first half of the ballet,[10] and listen to the last song motionless.[11]
Throughout Liebeslieder Walzer, the four couples display different kinds of emotions and subtle behavior, which is regarded as the most difficult part for the dancers.[4][12] Balanchine had remarked that the ballet is about the ""changing aspects of love.""[1] Shortly after the premiere, Balanchine said, ""In the first act, it's the real people that are dancing. In the second act, it's their souls.""[13] Alastair Macaulay, a New York Times critic who broke down the first section, wrote that the ballet is about ""adult love and its attendant shadows: tender, often rapturous, exceptionally poignant."" On one of the couple's interactions, he commented that he ""suspected"" that Balanchine was ""telling us something about himself.""[5]
A soprano, a mezzo-soprano, a tenor, a baritone and two pianists playing in four hands perform on stage left.[1][5][10] All of them are dressed in evening suits and ball gowns, identical to the ones worn by the dancers.[7][12]

Production[edit]
Music[edit]
Liebeslieder Walzer is set to Johannes Brahms' Liebeslieder Waltzes, Op. 52 and Neue Liebeslieder, Op. 65,[2] 33 songs in total.[14] Apart from the final song, which is set to poetry by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, all the lyrics are taken from Georg Friedrich Daumer's poets.[3] Balanchine had said that he ""had to do dances set to this music"" despite its length.[11]

Designs[edit]
The original set, designed by David Hays, is a bourgeois salon. In 1984, a year after Balanchine died, New York City Ballet co-founder Lincoln Kirstein commissioned a new Rococo-inspired sets by David Mitchell, which were inspired by Nymphenburg Palace, where Balanchine had visited in 1971,[1][7][15] and was the sets Balanchine envisioned when he made the ballet.[7][16] Barbara Karinska designed the costumes.[1]

In 2020, in response to performance cancellations due to the coronavirus, New York City Ballet released two extracts of Liebeslieder Walzer online. The first one, recorded in 2012, features Maria Kowroski and Jonathan Stafford. The second one was recorded in 2016 with Lauren Lovette, in her role debut, and Jared Angle.[18]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


1935 ballet by Dmitri Shostakovich
The Limpid Stream (Russian: Светлый ручей, also translated as The Bright Stream), Op. 39, is a ballet in 3 acts, 4 scenes, composed by Dmitri Shostakovich on the libretto by Adrian Piotrovsky and Fyodor Lopukhov, with choreography by Fyodor Lopukhov.  It premiered in Leningrad's Mikhaylovsky Theatre in 1935.


Plot[edit]
The plot centres around a group of ballet dancers who have been sent to provide sophisticated entertainment on a new Soviet collective farm[1] during their harvest festival.[2]  The workers, along with two older residents of a nearby dacha, welcome the city dancers, with special welcome given to the troupe's ballerina who was the former dance teacher of Zina.  Zina introduces the ballerina to her husband, Pyotr, and Pyotr immediately begins to flirt with the ballerina.  Hurt, Zina removes herself from the celebrations and is comforted by the ballerina.  The ballerina suggests a plan in which she will dress as her dance partner, her dance partner will dress as a female dancer, and Zina will dress as the ballerina.  They will fool Pyotr and the two dacha dwellers[2] and Pyotr will realize his mistake.[3]  The woes of two other couples with overly-assured men are also resolved through the plan.  After this all has been accomplished, there is a grand celebration which, in the Ratmansky production, includes the grim reaper who, after a scare, is banished.[3]

Score and instrumentation[edit]
The score includes references to Tchaikovsky and other ballet composers.[1]
Woodwinds: piccolo, 2 flutes (flute II = piccolo II), 2 oboes, cor anglais, E♭ clarinet, 2 B♭ clarinets, bass clarinet (= clarinet III), 2 bassoons, contra-bassoon (= bassoon III)

Suite[edit]
In 1945, Shostakovich approved Konstantin Titarenko to make a suite from the ballet. It was designated Op. 39a and comprises five movements:

WaltzRussian Popular DanceGalopAdagioPizzicato: Allegretto
Reception[edit]
The other two ballet scores written by Shostakovich are The Golden Age, from 1930, and The Bolt, from 1931. ""All three were banned shortly after their premieres, leaving Shostakovich's reputation so damaged that he was reluctant ever to write for the lyric stage again.""[4] The Bright Stream's deliberately simple melodies, harmonies,  rhythms, and colors had the work playing successfully in both Leningrad and Moscow from June 1935 through February 1936. An editorial entitled ""Balletic Falsity"" in Pravda in early February 1936 condemned the ballet, which was subsequently withdrawn.[5]  Due to this, one of the librettists, Piotrovsky was arrested in November the following year and executed in a gulag.[6]  Lobukhov, as choreographer and co-librettist, likely escaped from a similar fate due to his connections through his sister Lydia Lopokova.[4]

Productions[edit]
Alexei Ratmansky, currently an artist in residence at the American Ballet Theatre and the former director of the Bolshoi Ballet, first came across the full score of the ballet in a recording made by Gennady Rozhdestvensky in Stockholm in 1995. Unable to restore the original choreography of the ballet, which was never notated, Ratmansky wrote his own choreography and staged the new two act version of The Limpid Stream with the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow in 2003.
In July 2005 the Bolshoi performed The Bright Stream at the Met, and in August 2006, at the Royal Opera House, London.  The Bolshoi performed it in Moscow during late October 2017, as well as in London during August 2019.
In January 2011, American Ballet Theatre performed The Bright Stream in Ratmansky's choreography, at the Kennedy Center, Washington, D.C.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet
The Little Humpbacked Horse, or The Tsar Maiden (a.k.a. Konyok Gorbunok ili Tsar-Devitsa, or Le Petit cheval bossu, ou La Tsar-Demoiselle) is a ballet in four acts and eight scenes with apotheosis.

Photo of cast members of the Bolshoi Theatre in Alexander Gorsky's revival of The Little Humpbacked Horse. In the center of the  photograph are Lyubov Roslavleva as the Tsar Maiden (front, standing), Vasily Tikhomirov as the Humpbacked Horse (center, back) and Nikolai Domashev as Ivanushka (center, reclining). Moscow, 1901.

Story of the ballet[edit]
The libretto is by Arthur Saint-Léon, based on the fairy tale The Little Humpbacked Horse by Pyotr Yershov. However, the choreographer substantially deviated from Yershov's original tale.[1]
The ballet shows how Ivan the fool, with the aid of a magical horse, defeats an evil Khan and wins the hand of the Tsar-Maiden. Eventually Ivan replaces the ineffective and incompetent Tsar and becomes Tsar himself.[2][3]

Choreography of Saint-Léon[edit]
The original choreography was created by Arthur Saint-Léon and was set to music by Cesare Pugni.
The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on 15 December [O.S. 3 December] 1864 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. Marfa Muravyova (as the Tsar Maiden) and Timofey Stukolkin (as Ivanushka) were planned as principal performers. However, Stukolkin had broken his leg and was replaced with Nilolay Troitsky, who had no previous experience of dancing principal roles.
The ballet became an important milestone in the development of Russian ballet. It was the first ballet based on a Russian story. Composer Pugni included Russian folk songs in the music for the ballet and choreographer Arthur Saint-Léon created specifically Russian folk dancing – overall 22 Russian folk dances were staged. However, the French choreographer was not very knowledgeable in Russian folk dancing and invented many of them himself, including the ""Ural dance"".[4] The ballet was very colorful and became a huge success.
Russian democratic critics such as Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin and Nikolay Nekrasov however strongly criticized the work.[5] They viewed the ballet as a pathetic parody of Russian dances rather than a genuine collection of dances, and accused the choreographer of being mediocre, the audience of tastelessness, Tsar Alexander II of having a criminal attitude to his people, and all of them together of a lack of understanding of social development.[4]
On the other hand, the ballet enjoyed success with the audience. In its turn, it triggered the creation of a series of Russian-style ballets on the Imperial scene. Simultaneously, the Moscow Imperial troupe developed a different style, combining classical European choreography with real Russian folk dance.
After two years, 13 December [O.S. 1 December] 1866, the ballet was moved to the Moscow Imperial troupe.
In 1876, Sokolov re-staged the choreography of Saint-Léon in Moscow at the Bolshoi Theatre, using genuine Russian dances.[6][7] This re-staging separated the two ways the ballet was performed - the classical dance in Saint Petersburg and the dance incorporated into the performance in Moscow.[6] This eventually developed into two schools of Russian Ballet, which survived well into the 1930s. Subsequently, the Moscow school ceased to exist when a large number of Saint Petersburg dancers were moved to Moscow in the 1930s.[8][9]
A hundred years later, in 1960, the Russian composer Rodion Shchedrin created a new ballet on the same subject.

Alexander Radunsky choreographed his own version to an entirely new score by Rodion Shchedrin for the Bolshoi Ballet, Moscow, in 1960. The choreographer, Igor Belsky utilized Schedrin's score in his staging for the Maly Theatre in Leningrad in 1963. The Radunsky—Shchedrin version was filmed in 1961 with Maya Plisetskaya as the Tsar Maiden and Vladimir Vasiliev as Ivanushka.
Notes[edit]
In an effort to appeal to the tastes of his Imperial Russian audience, Saint-Léon concluded the ballet with a Grand divertissement celebrating all the different nations of Russia, beginning with a Grand cortège to a march by the composer titled The Peoples of Russia. The Grand divertissement included the choreographer's own balletic version of Russian national dance.
Petipa's 1895 revival included a new prologue and apotheosis, as well as additional variations for the Ballerina Legnani written by Riccardo Drigo.

The Loves of Mars and Venus by John Weaver was arguably the first modern ballet, the first dance work to tell a story through dance, gesture and music alone.[1]  Its first performance was at London's Drury Lane Theatre on Saturday 2 March 1717.


Background[edit]
Before 1717 ballet had always been part of operas and plays and dependent on their words to narrate the drama. The Loves of Mars and Venus was a danced drama, equal to the plays seen on London’s stage, described in its own time as a ‘Dramatic Entertainment of Dancing’, “the first of this kind produced upon the British Stage or in the Kingdom”.[2] All the action was conveyed in dance and mime alone, setting a pattern for future ballets”.[3]

The story[edit]
Weaver’s ballet tells the story of the love affair between Venus, the goddess of love, and Mars, the god of war, and the revenge enacted on them by her husband Vulcan. It draws on classical mythology, but contemporary passions abound, and its immediate source was Peter Anthony Motteux's play, The Loves of Mars and Venus, written in 1695. Despite Weaver’s appeal to the revered performances of the ‘mimes and pantomimes’ of classical antiquity, who he wished to emulate, his ballet was a thoroughly modern work in tune with the sophisticated comedies of his own time.
The Loves of Mars and Venus told the familiar story in six short scenes full of dancing and gestures. It lasted, perhaps, 40 minutes. Mars appears with his soldiers and performs a war dance. Venus is shown surrounded by the Graces and displays her allure in a sensual passacaille, but when Vulcan arrives she quarrels with him in a dance ‘of the pantomimic kind’. Vulcan retires to his smithy to devise revenge with the help of his workmen the Cyclops. Mars and Venus meet and, with their followers, perform dances expressive of love and desire. Vulcan completes his plan of revenge against the lovers. In the final scene, Vulcan and the Cyclops catch Mars and Venus together and expose them to the derision of the other gods, until Neptune intervenes and harmony is restored in a final ‘Grand Dance’.

The performance[edit]
At the first performances of The Loves of Mars and Venus, Mars was danced by Louis Dupré, Venus was Hester Santlow and John Weaver himself danced Vulcan. Dupré was a virtuoso dancer who was probably French, although he was probably not the famous ‘Le grand’ Dupré of the Paris Opera. Mrs Santlow was an English dancer-actress, greatly admired for her beauty as well as her dancing skills – one contemporary described her as ‘incomparable’. Weaver’s stage skills were essentially those of a comic dancer, although he was obviously also a master of rhetorical gesture. They were supported by Drury Lane’s best dancers as the ‘Followers’ of Mars and Venus, with the company’s comedians as Weaver’s workmen the Cyclops.

Reception and subsequent history[edit]
The Loves of Mars and Venus was an undoubted success, with seven performances during its first season and revivals at the Drury Lane Theatre until 1724. Colley Cibber the English actor- manager, playwright and Poet Laureate, said of it ‘To give even Dancing therefore some Improvement; and to make it something more than Motion without Meaning, the Fable of Mars and Venus, was form’d into a connected Presentation of Dances in Character, wherein the Passions were so happily expressed, and the whole Story so intelligibly told, by a mute Narration of Gesture only, that even thinking Spectators allow’d it both a pleasing and a rational Entertainment’.[4] It also inspired a parody version by John Rich[5]
It was subsequently far more influential than many realise. It may well have been seen by the young French ballerina Marie Sallé, who would herself later experiment with narrative and expressive dancing. Sallé, of course, influenced the choreographer Jean-Georges Noverre when he came to create his ballets d’action. They led to the story ballets of the romantic period and onwards to the narrative dance works for which English ballet became famous in the 20th century.

300th anniversary performance[edit]
The Weaver Dance Company, was founded in 2016, to produce a show to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the first performance of The Loves of Mars and Venus. Weaver created a patchwork to make his musical score, a pasticcio, but it has been lost. So a pasticcio was pieced together using music from the London stage of the day with works by Jean-Baptiste Lully (1632–87), Jacques Paisible (c1656-1721), Henry Purcell (1659–95), Gottfried Finger (c1660-1730), John Eccles (1668-1735), Jeremiah Clarke (c1674-1704), and William Croft (1678-1727), using Weaver’s text as a guide.[citation needed]
As a reconstruction of the full dance-drama with its cast of 26 characters was beyond the Company’s resources, they set out to create a show that would introduce the audience to the world of the 18th-century London stage and John Weaver’s frustrations with the limitations of dancing there, following Weaver as he tries to create his first ‘Dramatick Entertainment of Dancing’ with dance taking an equal place as an art alongside music and drama.
Using John Weaver’s own published scenario to reconstruct the gestures and theatrical dances recorded in Beauchamp–Feuillet notation in the early 18th century as the basis for new choreography, The Weaver Dance Company presented their The Loves of Mars and Venus, exactly 300 years to the day after the first performance, at the Fitzwilliam College Auditorium in Cambridge on 2 March 2017.

Frontispiece for the original published piano reduction of Riccardo Drigo's score for Lev Ivanov's La flûte magique, 1912
La flûte magique (en. The Magic Flute) (ru. «Волшебная флейта», Volshebnaya Fleita) is a ballet comique in one act, originally choreographed by Lev Ivanov to the music of Riccardo Drigo. First presented by students of the Imperial Ballet School at the school's theatre on 4 February [O.S. 23 January] 1893. Although it has the same title as Mozart's opera The Magic Flute, the two works have no other connection.[1]


History[edit]
La flûte magique was originally created for the graduation performance of students of the Imperial Ballet School. The ballet premiered on the stage of the school's theatre on 4 February [O.S. 23 January] 1893, and featured a young Mikhail Fokine in the principal role of Luc. La flûte magique was soon transferred to the repertory of the Imperial Ballet, where it was first presented on 23 April [O.S. 11 April] 1893 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre with Anna Johansson in the role of Lise and Pavel Gerdt in the role of Luc. The ballet served as a useful vehicle for the ballerinas of the Tsarist stage including Anna Pavlova, who would later include the work in the repertory of her own touring company.[1]
Riccardo Drigo's score was later published in piano reduction and orchestral partition by the music publisher Zimmerman in 1912. The score was recorded in 1990 by the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, conducted by Richard Bonynge and issued on the label London.
The ballet has been re-staged in several versions, notably by Peter Martins for the School of American Ballet. This production was first presented on 9 May 1981. A second premiere was given by the New York City Ballet on 21 January 1982, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center with décor designed by David Mitchell and costumes by Ben Benson.

The Magic Mirror (French: Le Miroir Magique) is a ballet-féerie in four acts and seven scenes, originally choreographed by Marius Petipa with music by Arseny Koreshchenko. The libretto is based on the 1812 fairy tale Snow White by the Brothers Grimm and the 1833 poem The Tale of the Dead Princess and the Seven Knights by Alexander Pushkin. The ballet was premièred on the 22 February [O.S. 9 February] 1903 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia.


History[edit]
The Magic Mirror was the final ballet to be staged by Petipa and was probably his most controversial. Prince Serge Volkonsky commissioned Petipa to create the ballet in 1902, but soon afterwards, Volkonsky was forced to resign from his position as director after an incident with the Prima Ballerina, Mathilde Kschessinskaya and instead, The Magic Mirror was staged under the direction of Col. Vladimir Teliakovsky, Petipa's bitterest enemy. Teliakovsky was determined to de-throne Petipa from his rank of ballet master and Petipa writes in his memoirs that Teliakovsky would stop at nothing to get rid of him and that he believed it was Teliakovsky's plan to sabotage what was to be his last ballet. The Magic Mirror was given the most appalling staging imaginable with horrific scenery designs and costumes that were unfinished and provoked unanimous laughter.[1]
The Magic Mirror was a complete disaster and was received with whistles, cat-calls and even shouts of ""curtain"" in subsequent performances after the première. Although it was given two abridged performances in 1904, the ballet never found a permanent place in the Imperial Ballet repertoire. It did, however, find a home in Moscow, where it was staged in a revival by Alexander Gorsky and was performed thirty-six times between 1905 and 1911. Despite the failure of the original production, in all the scathing reviews for The Magic Mirror, including a very notorious one by Sergei Diaghilev, Petipa's choreography is never criticised.[2]
Petipa gives the following account in his memoirs of how he was convinced that the ballet's poor staging was all part of a conspiracy to get rid of him:[3]

... Already, during the rehearsals of this ballet, I was convinced that was something was being plotted against me and my ballet, the commission for which had been given to M. Koreshchenko and me by M. Volkonsky, and not by M. Teliakovsky. Mlle. Kschessinskaya took an active part in this intrigue, revenging herself because at the benefit of her late father, I had not greeted him with a speech.

ACT 1 – A garden in front of the palace
Scene 1
Gardeners, men and women, are decorating the garden, weaving baskets and preparing garlands for the Queen.
Scene 2
The King and Queen enter with courtly ladies and cavaliers; the Queen is young and beautiful, the King old; he tries to please the Queen. Baskets and garlands are brought to the Queen.
Scene 3
The King orders the lace merchants to be led in, whom he has summoned, together with the lace-makers and workmen of their countries, and also the merchants of old Bohemian crystal and precious stones. Among other objects, there is a beautiful ‘magic’ mirror, which possesses the property of reflecting the most beautiful woman in the entire realm. The Queen, seeing her own reflection, is delighted, much to the joy of the King, who buys the mirror. The Queen, rejoicing, invites the courtiers to dance.
After the Mazurka, the King orders for the mirror to be taken to the Queen's room. The Queen looks into the mirror again, but to her question, “Am I the most beautiful of all?” the mirror reflects the image of the Princess. The Queen is horrified. In the loud distance, trumpets are heard; the Queen is upset.
Scene 4
The Princess and her fiancé, the Prince enters with their retinues. The King is overjoyed. The secret envy of the Queen, who recognises in the Princess's face the image that reflected in the mirror, that is, of the one woman whose beauty exceeds her own.
At the end of the Pas d’action, the Queen, extremely upset, asks the mirror again, “Who is the most beautiful of all?” and once again, the mirror presents the Princess's image in all its beauty. This time the Queen, in a fit of envy and anger, faints. All rush to her assistance.
ACT 2
Scene 1 – A park
At the rise of the curtain, the Queen is on stage, her gaze fixed on the mirror. She says to herself, “As long as the Princess is here, I will not be the most beautiful… she must die!”
Scene 2
The Queen calls for the Princess's nurse and says to her, “Listen carefully to my commands: you will go into the forest with the Princess and you will kill her!”
Horrified, the nurse pleads, “Take pity, take pity on the young Princess, whom I love so much!”
“No!” answers the Queen, “there shall be no mercy. She must die and you must obey me. If not… you will die…”
She hands her a dagger.
Scene 3
They announce the Princess's arrival. She has come to ask the Queen to be present at her wedding. Hiding her envy, the Queen receives the Princess courteously and agrees to her request. Then the Queen asks her to go into the nearby forest with her nurse to pick forget-me-nots, of which the Queen is extremely fond. The Princess, delighted that she can bring pleasure to the Queen, kisses her hand and leaves with the nurse.
Scene 4
As soon as she leaves, the Queen walks up to the mirror and says to herself: “Now I shall be the most beautiful of all.”
Scene 5 – A dense forest
The Princess enters with her nursemaid. Compelled to obey the Queen, the nurse is trembling. The Princess looks around in all directions and says to her, “This forest frightens me; there are no forget-me-nots here; why did you bring me so far from the castle?”
“The Queen commanded me,” the nurse answers.
“Why?” asks the Princess.
“She commanded me to bring you to this forest and to kill you!”
“Me? Why? What have I done?”
“You are more beautiful than she,” the nurse sobs.
“And you must kill me for that? No, no that is not possible! You would not commit such a horrible deed!”
“It must be thus,” the nurse answers, weeping and holding the dagger in her hand.
The Princess pleads on her knees, “Take pity on me, on my youth!”
The nurse, powerfully moved, throws down the dagger, and embraces her, kisses her, saying, “Stay here, try to get your bearings and find a way out of this horrible forest.”
They pray. Then the nurse kisses her warmly again and saying, “May the Lord protect you,” she flees like one insane.
Scene 6
The Princess calls after her for help, but in vain. The nurse is too far away to hear the Princess's calls. Trembling, the Princess looks to find her way, walking through the trees and trying to get out of the forest, she disappears among them.
Scene 7
Little by little, the stage fills with dryads, who have gathered for diversion.
Scene 8
After the dryads’ dance, a curtain rises at the back of the stage and in the clear distance; the Queen's shade is seen, wrathfully threatening the Princess's nurse for having spared her. The nurse falls at the Queen's feet and begs for her forgiveness. The Queen rudely throws her back. Then the Queen commands that she herself be dressed in peasant's clothes so that she may realise her own intention, having conceived the idea of giving the princess a poisoned apple. The Princess's maid dresses her. The Vision disappears.
Scene 9 – Huts and a cave on rocky hills
Gnomes come out of the cave and down from the hills: some are carrying sheaves of brushwood; others are digging out passageways in the crags.
Scene 10
The Princess rushes in, frightened, for she cannot find her way out of the forest... suddenly she finds herself surrounded by gnomes, who are fascinated with her and try to calm her down. The Elder of the Gnomes leads her into his hut, where she is attired in a dress of tree leaves.
Scene 11
A merry dance of the gnomes.
Scene 12
The Princess appears in her dress of leaves, strewn with dew-drops. The gnomes ask her to dance and she agrees. The gnomes stand in groups and beat time on their anvils, accompanying the Princess during her dance. After the variations, the Elder of the Gnomes takes the Princess into the hut and advises her not to admit anybody during his absence. The gnomes depart for work with their implements.
Scene 13
The Queen, dressed as a peasant girl and carrying a basket of apples, appears stealthily and knocks on the door of the hut.
Scene 14
The Princess comes out, meets her with compassion and gives her some bread. In gratitude, the Queen offers an apple (poisoned). The Princess at first declines the apple, then accepts it, takes a bite and, stunned, falls down as if dead. The Queen gloats over her deed and fails to notice that she has dropped her handkerchief; seeing that the gnomes are returning, she runs out.
Scene 15
The gnomes joyfully return, but horror seizes them at the sight of the Princess. The Elder of the Gnomes finds the handkerchief and shows it to the others, evidence that an outside has been there.
ACT 3 – The Grand Forest
Scene 1
The Prince appears in search of the Princess. He is despondent, sorrowful and tired. He sits down next to a large tree to rest and falls asleep.
Scene 2
The Prince's dream – sunlight and dance of the sunrays.
Scene 3
The sun slowly sets and the moon appears in its place, surrounded by stars.
Scene 4
Grand pas of the Princess escorted by zephyrs and stars.
Scene 5
The Prince (that is, his shade) wants to draw the Princess into his embrace; they rush towards each other, but they cannot come together. At the very moment they are about to embrace, darkness falls and everything disappears.
Scene 6
The Prince awakens, still under the influence of his dream. He tries to orient himself to the forest, looks around, asking himself, “What path must I take to return to the castle?”
He climbs the tree; as he does, at the back of the stage, a valley appears; the sky is studded with stars. From the height of the tree, the Prince sees the castle; he climbs down and exits in the direction of the castle.
ACT 4
Scene 1
The gnomes are carrying the Princess away in a glass coffin covered with flowers; they place the coffin deep in a grotto. The gnomes leave praying; one remains to stand guard and then falls asleep.

Dance of the everlasting flowers.
Scene 3
The Elder of the Gnomes comes forward; behind him follows the King, Queen, the Prince, the nurse and the King's grooms. The gnome shows them the place where the Princess rests. The Queen conceals her joy. The King is sorrowful. The nurse is crying. The Prince, in despair at the sight of the dead Princess, approaches the grating. He breaks the grating and the coffin. At that instant, the apple rolls out in front of the Prince.
Scene 4
The Princess comes to life... the Queen stands in astonishment, as if turned to stone. The others express their great joy. The Princess stands up (she is wrapped in a gold coverlet), glides along like a shade as the coverlet falls away; she sees the Prince, who rushes to embrace her.
The Queen's horror...
The King's excitement...
The Prince's delight and the pervasive joy
The gnome hands the King the handkerchief as material evidence of who gave the Princess the poisoned apple. The King recognises the Queen's handkerchief and shows it to her asking, “Is this your handkerchief?”
“Yes,” the Queen answers trembling with anger and fear, “I don’t understand how it came to be in the hands of this gnome.”
“Was it you who gave her the poisoned apple?”
“No… no…” in her fury, she cannot pronounce another word.
The King asks his daughter who gave her the apple. The Prince also begs her to recount everything. The Princess answers, “A poor peasant girl, who was carrying a basket of apples.”
At that moment, the nursemaid, all in tears, no longer able to keep the secret, tells everything that happened, but the Princess stops her and finishes the story. The King is frightfully angry and threatens the Queen with the dungeon. A sudden derangement of the Queen's mind, who, in an attack of insanity, tells all what she ordered done and then falls dead.
Scene 5 – A hall in the castle
The betrothal of the Prince and Princess.
In this last scene, character dances and classical pas.

The Magic Pills (Les Pilules magiques) is a ballet-féerie with three acts and thirteen scenes. The choreography is by Marius Petipa, and the music is by Ludwig Minkus.
The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on February 21, 1886, at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. The ballet was presented in honor of the inauguration of the Mariinsky Theatre as the Imperial Ballet and Opera's principal venue in 1886 and was the first ballet performed in the theatre. Principal dancer Varvara Nikitina performed the leading role.[1]


History[edit]
After the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre became the new permanent residence of the Imperial Ballet, The Magic Pills was the first ballet to be performed in honor of the dedication. The Magic Pills was also one of the first full-length ballets féerie to be performed in Russia, though Petipa had been commissioned to create multiple such productions by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, who had a keen interest in the modern ballet culture and was fascinated by the purely theatrical elegance that was characteristic of the ballet féerie.
The ballet féerie genre was characterized by its fantasy elements and spectacular visuals, mostly lacking any dramatic content or thematic depth. Ballet féerie had increased in popularity across Europe throughout the 1880s thanks to its escapist qualities and outlandish showmanship. The success of Luigi Manzotti and Romualdo Marenco's premiere of Excelsior at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan in 1881, followed by equally successful premieres in London and St. Petersberg, prompted other such spectacles as Round the World in Eighty Days and Voyage à la Lune, in which Virginia Zucchi made her debut in Saint Petersburg in 1885.

Mathilde Kschessinska in the Dance of the Silver Lace
Petipa, however, held no such admiration for the ballet féerie, detesting the lack of artistic merit and the emphasis on modern pageantry in Excelsior. Still, he wrote several ballets féerie at the request of Vsevolozhsky, including The Magic Pills, and to fulfill the demands of the public and the officials. Petipa’s ballet féerie was noticeably less theatrical and borrowed elements from other sources by adding his own signature touch to make them suitable for ballet. Despite his distaste for the genre, Petipa’s subsequent work, such as Le Roi Candaule, was influenced by the ballet féerie and utilized rearrangements of grand-scale ensemble scenes in his newer productions.
The Magic Pills premiered at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre on February 21, 1886, and marked the first ballet performance in the new theatre. The plot of the ballet was sparse and created purely as a vehicle for displaying entertaining sets of dances. Each act and scene represented a game or toy, with the most extravagant act being the third and final Kingdom of the Laces sequence. The ballet also contained elements of vaudeville and included some episodes with singing and comedy.[citation needed] The Magic Pills was a huge critical and commercial success in St. Petersburg.[citation needed]

1940 Azerbaijani ballet by Afrasiyab Badalbeyli
Maiden TowerA scene from the first staging of the ballet, 1940.MusicAfrasiyab BadalbeyliLibrettoAfrasiyab BadalbeyliPremiere18 April 1940Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, Baku
Maiden Tower is the first Azerbaijani ballet[1] and the first ballet in the Muslim Eastern countries.[2][3] It consists of three acts with a prologue and epilogue. Afrasiyab Badalbeyli is the author of the music and libretto.[1]
The premiere took place on 18 April 1940 at the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, and a new version of the ballet was presented on 24 October 1999.This new version did not include the Soviet propaganda the previous version did.[4] Yulana Alikishizade was the author of the new version. Madina Aliyeva and Gulaghasi Mirzoyev danced the main parts. Farhad Badalbeyli was the author of the revised score. Members of Azerbaijan State Song and Dance Ensemble under the guidance of Afag Malikova took part in the performance.[5][6]

Plot[edit]
The story begins with Khan Jhahangir coming back to the palace from the battle. One of many wives of the khan was pregnant before he left, and the khan was expecting a male heir. But the child was a girl, so the khan ordered the execution of the baby. Princess Gulyanag is raised as an unwanted child, away from the eyes of the khan until she reaches maturity. By then, she has a lover named Polad. But the khan sees the now 17 years old Gulyanag, and not realizing that she is his daughter, falls in love with her. Starting from here, the two versions of the play start to diverge, before connecting at the end.[7]
In the first version, upon learning of her loves, the khan separates Gulyanag from Polad by locking her in a tower. Polad find the tower eventually, but the khan is also there to marry Gulyanag. Polad and Khan Jhahangir battle and Polad wins. Polad climbs the stairs of the tower and Gulyanag hears the steps. She thinks that it is the Khan coming to get her instead of Polad and throws herself off the window of the tower to the sea, falling to her death.[8]
In the revised version, the Khan forces Gulyanag to marry him. But the princess refuses, and tells the khan she won't marry him until he builds her a tower, to gain time. This shows the smart leading female character, not shown in the previous Soviet version. When the tower is finished, the Khan locks her in the tower and starts preparations for the wedding. But Polad finds him in the palace and kills the khan before making his way to the tower. Gulyanag, knowing the Khan was preparing for the wedding, upon hearing the rushed footsteps, assumes the person is the Khan instead of her lover, coming to reunite with her. She, again, jumps off the window of the tower and to her death. Polad reaches the top of the tower with no trace of Gulyanag. Realizing his lover died, he mourns her.

228,Mam'zelle Angot,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mam%27zelle_Angot,"Mam'zelle Angot , Charles Lecocq , 1943","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Mam'zelle Angot is a one-act ballet in three scenes. The choreography and libretto are by Léonide Massine; the music is by Charles Lecocq. The plot is broadly based on Lecocq's 1872 opéra bouffe, La fille de Madame Angot.


Background[edit]
Massine had previously created ballets to scores specially arranged from works by Scarlatti (The Good-Humoured Ladies, 1917), Rossini (La boutique fantasque, 1919), Johann Strauss (Le beau Danube, 1933) and Offenbach (Gaîté Parisienne, 1938). They were arranged and orchestrated by, respectively, Vincenzo Tommasini, Ottorino Respighi, Roger Désormière and Manuel Rosenthal.[1] Massine's innovation of creating ballets to scores arranged from the music of a single composer was followed by other choreographers including George Balanchine, Frederick Ashton and John Cranko.[n 1] Mam'zelle Angot was Massine's final work in this genre.[3]

History[edit]
Massine's first version of the ballet was produced by Ballet Theatre under the title Mademoiselle Angot, at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York, with Nora Kaye in the title role, Massine as the barber, Rosella Hightower as the aristocrat and André Eglevsky as the caricaturist. The music was arranged by Efrem Kurtz and orchestrated by Richard Mohaupt and Gordon Jones.[4]
Massine revived the work for Sadler's Wells Ballet during a visit to London in 1947 (when he also staged and danced in Le Tricorne and La Boutique Fantasque),[5] with the title Mam'zelle Angot and a new score, taken mainly from La fille de Madame Angot,[n 2] arranged by Gordon Jacob, designs by André Derain, and a cast that included Margot Fonteyn as Mam'zelle Angot, Alexander Grant as the barber, Moira Shearer as the aristocrat, and Michael Somes as the caricaturist. Australian Ballet took this version into its repertoire in 1971.[7]
Having been performed in most seasons from 1947 to 1959, and toured by the Touring Company in 1968-69, the ballet was revived at Covent Garden in the spring of 1980 in memory of Massine who died the previous year.[8] Other dancers to have appeared with both companies included Angot Julia Farron, Avril Navarre, Nadia Nerina, and Merle Park; Brian Shaw and Ronald Emblen as the barber; John Field, David Blair, Paul Clarke and Christopher Gable as the caricaturist; and Gerd Larsen, Julia Farron, Rosemary Lindsay and Georgia Parkinson as the aristocrat.[9]

Synopsis[edit]
Scene 1: The market[edit]
After a short overture the scene opens in a bustling marketplace. Vivacious Mam'zelle Angot, reluctantly engaged to be married to a barber, falls in love with a young caricaturist who introduces himself with a solo in a mazurka rhythm, and at first returns her affections. He has drawn a cartoon mocking a senior government official and his aristocratic mistress, but he now becomes entranced with the aristocrat and forgets his first love. Mam'zelle Angot, jealous, slanders the aristocrat in public realising that her action will cause her arrest, and help her avoid her obligation to marry the barber. A group of unthreatening gendarmes take her away.

Scene 2: The house of the aristocrat[edit]
A reception is in progress. The aristocrat and official dance a gavotte and three ladies a pas de trois. The caricaturist is discovered in the house, fleeing from the soldiers sent to arrest him for his defamatory caricatures. The scene is witnessed by the lovelorn Mam'zelle Angot; she has been sent for by the aristocrat to explain her behaviour, and the meeting reveals that they are old school friends. The unhappy barber, in search of Mam'zelle Angot, is also present. The government official orders the arrest of the caricaturist, who having spent the ball hidden behind a pillar, chooses this moment to declare his love for the aristocrat. They dance a romantic adagio.

Scene 3: The carnival[edit]
Mam'zelle Angot has contrived to bring the aristocrat and the caricaturist face-to-face at the carnival. With the help of her market friends, she exposes the aristocrat to the betrayed government official, who has arrived in disguise. The victims of her scheme are roundly mocked, and Mam'zelle Angot decides after all that it is the barber whom she loves. A potpourri of tunes ends the ballet in lively merry-making.[10][11]

Film and recordings[edit]
The Royal Ballet's staging of the ballet was filmed in 1964, with Merle Park as Mam'zelle Angot, Alexander Grant as the barber, Antoinette Sibley as the aristocrat, and David Blair as the caricaturist.[12] A 40-minute film of it in New York is recorded in WorldCat.[13]
Suites from both versions of the ballet have been recorded. In 1949 Efrem Kurtz conducted the New York Philharmonic Orchestra in seven numbers from Mademoiselle Angot: I. Overture; II. Waltz; III. March; IV. Polka; V. Gavotte; VI. Grand Waltz; VII. Can-Can. There have been three recordings of selections from Gordon Jacob's arrangements for Mamzelle Angot: by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Robert Irving (1958); the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden conducted by Anatole Fistoulari (1957);[14] and the National Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Richard Bonynge (1983).[14] The last of these is the fullest selection, comprising Overture; I. Allegro; II. Allegretto – III. Mazurka; IV. Andantino – Valse; V. Tempo di marcia; VI. Allegro vivace – VII. Allegretto; VIII. Allegro – Gavotte – IX. Allegro – Valse; X. Allegro – Valse – XI. Allegro – XII. Adagio; XIII. Allegro moderato; XIV. Allegro molto – Polka.[15]

229,Marguerite and Armand,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marguerite_and_Armand,"Marguerite and Armand , to music by Franz Liszt , 1963","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Marguerite and Armand is a ballet danced to an orchestral arrangement of Franz Liszt's B minor piano sonata. It was created in 1963 by the British choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton specifically for Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn. The ballet takes its inspiration from the 1848 novel La Dame aux Camélias by Alexandre Dumas, fils, and other adaptations of the same story such as Giuseppe Verdi's 1853 opera La traviata.


Plot[edit]
Marguerite Gautier, a Parisian courtesan, lies on her deathbed, gravely ill with tuberculosis.  In her delirium she recalls her love affair with a young man named Armand, which the ballet portrays using many dreamlike flashback sequences.
In the first flashback, Marguerite, wearing a red dress, is surrounded by admirers and suitors. She lets them flirt with her, but feels no real emotions. Armand enters and falls for Marguerite immediately, and she returns his feelings. At the end of this sequence, Marguerite tests Armand's love by throwing a white flower to the ground as her wealthy protector leads her away. Another suitor goes to pick up the flower, but when Armand moves to take it, the other man lets him. This symbolizes Marguerite and Armand as a couple.
Marguerite, now increasingly ill, deserts her wealthy protector to live in the countryside with Armand. However, Armand's father asks her to quit her lover; she agrees, but will not tell Armand why she must leave him. A despairing Marguerite is about to leave the country house when Armand enters, and becomes distressed upon seeing her so distraught. A passionate sequence follows, portraying the characters' love, Marguerite's sacrifice and Armand's confusion.
Armand, angered by Marguerite's lack of an explanation, publicly humiliates her by tearing the necklace given to her by her wealthy protector from her neck and throwing it to the floor, and throwing money in her face.
In the final scenes, sad and alone, Marguerite waits for inevitable death. However, Armand's father has revealed the truth to him and Armand makes it back to the apartment to hold Marguerite one last time. She dies in his arms.

Dancers[edit]
The ballet was particularly associated with Nureyev and Fonteyn, the original performers. It featured in their farewell performances in Fonteyn & Nureyev on Broadway. Revivals of the ballet have starred pairings such as Sylvie Guillem and Nicolas Le Riche, Zenaida Yanowsky and Roberto Bolle, Alessandra Ferri and Federico Bonelli, and Tamara Rojo and Sergei Polunin.[1] Polunin has also danced the ballet alongside Svetlana Zakharova.
In November 2015, the ballet was performed for the first time by The Sarasota Ballet, which marked the first time an American ballet company had been given permission to perform this iconic Ashton ballet. The piece was performed in a triple bill alongside Kenneth MacMillan's Concerto and Peter Wright's Summertide. The leading roles of Marguerite and Armand were performed by Principals Victoria Hulland and Ricardo Graziano and subsequently during the matinee performance by Danielle Brown and Juan Gil. Hulland and Graziano would become the first American woman and Brazilian man to perform these roles.[2]

Music[edit]
From 1963 to 1968 the ballet was danced to an orchestration of Liszt's sonata by Humphrey Searle. In 1968 the Royal Ballet commissioned a new arrangement, by Gordon Jacob.[3]

231,Les Masques,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Masques,"Les Masques , to music by Francis Poulenc , 1933","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Les Masques, ou Changement de dames is a short ballet of 1933 choreographed by Frederick Ashton to music by Francis Poulenc.[1] Ashton's biographer describes it as a miniature masterpiece, an inspired fusion of scenery, steps and music.[2]
The ballet reflected the social and sexual manners of Ashston's world, and the limited size of the Mercury Theatre obliged Ashton to understate the dancers' gestures and moves. A Personage is seen at a masked ball with his lady friend. They meet another couple, and they turn out to be his wife and her lover. After some changing of partners, at the end the wife and husband are a pair while the lover and mistress are also united.
The black and white costumes (made by Matilda Etches) and scenery (evoking an Arts Club Ball) were by Sophie Fedorovitch, who worked with Ashton on many other ballets during his career, and became, in his words, ""not only my dearest friend but my greatest artistic collaborator and adviser"".[3] Marie Rambert recalled going to an ironmongers in Shepherd's Bush to buy corrugated iron for the columns in the set; the full cost of the production was £60.[4]
The original cast at the Ballet Club on the 5 March 1933 consisted of Frederick Ashton as A Personage, Alicia Markova as His Lady Friend, Pearl Argyle as His Wife, Walter Gore as Her Lover, Elisabeth Schooling and Betty Cuff as Two Young Girls and Anna Brunton, Elisabeth Ruxton and Tamara Svetlova as Three Ladies with Fans.[1] At the premiere the music was played by Helen Gaskell, Cecil James and Charles Lynch.[4]
Poulenc's Trio for oboe, bassoon and piano was composed in Cannes in 1926, dedicated to Manuel de Falla, and premiered in Paris on 2 May that year. The three movements are marked Presto, Andante and Rondo.  When he saw the work, Poulenc was enchanted and in thanks gave Rambert an inscribed copy of his Soirées de Nazelles.[4] After the production left the repertory the choreography was lost and Ashton declined requests to revive the work.[2]
David Vaughan comments that Ashton had wanted Poulenc to compose the score for his first ballet, A Tragedy of Fashion, and seven years on ""was fully in command of the resources that could enable him to realise such a work"" – witty, sophisticated and of its time.[1] Later projects to collaborate between Ashton and Poulenc did not come to fruition.[2]

The ballet premiered on 14 February 1978, at the Royal Opera House, danced by The Royal Ballet, with David Wall as Prince Rudolf and Lynn Seymour as Vetsera.[1][2]


Synopsis[edit]
Characters from Kenneth MacMillan's Mayerling, via The Ballet Bag
Prologue: The cemetery at Heiligenkreuz before dawn

Act I[edit]
Scene 1: The ballroom at the Hofburg Palace, Vienna
A ball to celebrate the marriage of Crown Prince Rudolf of Austria-Hungary and Princess Stephanie of Belgium is in full swing. Rudolf flirts shamelessly with Stephanie's sister, Princess Louise, offending both his new bride and his parents, Emperor Franz Josef and Empress Elisabeth. Rudolf meets Countess Marie Larisch, a former mistress, and Baroness Vetsera. The Baroness introduces her 17-year-old daughter Mary Vetsera. Four Hungarian officers, friends of Rudolf, enter and forcefully argue the separatist cause of their country. Countess Larisch tries to rekindle her relationship with Rudolf. The pair are discovered by the Emperor, who demands that Rudolf return to his wife.
Scene 2: The Empress’s apartments at the Hofburg
Having retired from the ball, Empress Elisabeth is being attended by her ladies-in-waiting. Rudolf visits his mother, on his way to his new bride. He expresses his deep unhappiness at being pressured into marriage. Desperate for maternal affection he tries to embrace the Empress, only to be coldly rebuffed.
Scene 3: Rudolf’s apartments at the Hofburg
Princess Stephanie is getting ready for her wedding night. Rudolf enters and threatens Stephanie with a revolver before taking her forcibly.

Act II[edit]
Scene 1: A notorious tavern
Rudolf and Stephanie enter the tavern in disguise. They are accompanied by Rudolf's driver Bratfisch, who attempts to lighten Stephanie's spirits. Prostitutes compete for the men's attention and Stephanie flees the tavern in disgust. Rudolf turns his attention to his Hungarian friends and his regular mistress, the courtesan Mizzi Kaspar. The police burst in and Rudolf, Mitzi and the Hungarian officers hide. The police arrest several people before leaving. In a despairing mood, Rudolf proposes a suicide pact to Mitzi. The Prime Minister Count Taaffe enters the tavern, looking for Rudolf. Rudolf hides again but Mitzi tells the Count where he is hidden. The Count and Mitzi leave together.
Scene 2: Outside the tavern
Countess Larisch, ostensibly chaperoning Mary, presents the young girl to Rudolf as he leaves the tavern.
Scene 3: The Vetsera house
Countess Larisch calls on her friend Baroness Vetsera. She finds Mary absorbed by a portrait of Rudolf. Countess Larisch tells Mary's fortune using a pack of cards and informs her that her romantic dreams will come true. Mary gives the Countess a letter to deliver to Rudolf on her behalf.
Scene 4: The Hofburg
During the Emperor's birthday celebrations Count Taaffe confronts Rudolf over an incriminating political pamphlet on the Hungarian cause. Colonel 'Bay' Middleton hands the Count a joke cigar, to Rudolf's intense amusement. The Empress presents the Emperor with a portrait of his 'friend' Katherina Schratt. A firework display distracts everyone except the Empress and 'Bay.' Rudolf notices their amorous exchange and becomes bitterly resentful. Countess Larisch produces Mary's letter and teases Rudolf with it.
Scene 5: Rudolf’s apartments at the Hofburg
Mary and Rudolf meet in secret for the first time.

Act III[edit]
Scene 1: A royal shoot in the countryside
During a hunting expedition, Rudolf unaccountably shoots wildly. He kills a member of the court, narrowly missing his father.
Scene 2: Rudolf’s apartments at the Hofburg
The Empress discovers Countess Larisch and Rudolf alone together and angrily dismisses the Countess, unaware Mary is waiting outside. Mary enters after the Empress has left. Rudolf asks her to commit suicide with him.
Scene 3: The hunting lodge at Mayerling
Rudolf shares a drink with Count Hoyos and Prince Philipp of Coburg, attended by his valet Loschek. He asks them to leave, saying he is unwell. Bratfisch enters with Mary. Rudolf instructs Bratfisch to entertain him and Mary. Bratfisch, soon realizing he has lost their attention, leaves. In a mounting frenzy Rudolf makes love to Mary. He injects himself with morphine to calm his nerves and embraces Mary for the last time. He shoots her. Loschek, Hoyos and Philipp rush in, having heard the shot. Rudolf reassures them and instructs them to leave. Alone, he shoots himself. His friends rush in again, and collapse in despair when they find Rudolf's dead body.
Epilogue: The cemetery at Heiligenkreuz before dawn

Original production[edit]
Mayerling was first produced for the Royal Ballet in 1978, by the British choreographer Sir Kenneth Macmillan, with a scenario written by Gillian Freeman,[3] scenery and costume designs by Nicholas Georgiadis and lighting design by David Hersey.  Music for the ballet was compiled from existing works by Franz Liszt, arranged and orchestrated by John Lanchbery who also conducted the orchestra during the ballet's first season.  The ballet was dedicated to the Royal Ballet's founder choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton and premiered at the Royal Opera House, London, on 14 February 1978.  The Royal Opera House collections have archive information from twelve performances of this ballet, including the premiere and subsequent revivals.[4][5]

Critical reception[edit]
The original production was, in general, well received by critics, however there were some reservations. Many reviewers found the ballet overly long and the historical background of the story difficult to follow. However, Mary Clarke in the Guardian defended the complexity of the work: ""Easy, after one or two viewings, to say this or that scene must go. But patience and understanding bring rewards; every scene tells something about Rudolf and the Court of Vienna in his time.""[6]

Other productions[edit]
In 2013, Stanislavsky Ballet danced Mayerling for the first time, with Sergei Polunin as Rudolf.[7]
In 2017, Houston Ballet became the first North American company to perform Mayerling. The performance came shortly after Hurricane Harvey, which led to the company switching theatre. Connor Walsh danced Rudolf on the opening night.[8][9]
In 2019, Stuttgart Ballet presented a new productions, with new sets and costumes by German designer Jürgen Rose It was the first time that Mayerling was performed in different sets and costumes. Friedemann Vogel was cast as Rudolf.[10]
The Paris Opera Ballet was originally scheduled to debut Mayerling in May 2020,[11] but the performances had to be cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.[12] It was postponed to the autumn of 2022, with Hugo Marchand dancing Rudolf on the opening night.[13]
In 2021, Polish National Ballet, Polish premiere, stagers: Karl Burnett and Wayne Eagling. Vladimir Yaroshenko danced Rudolf on the opening night.[14]
In 2022, Scottish Ballet opened an adapted version of the ballet named The Scandal at Mayerling.[15] Two scenes are omitted from this production: Emperor Franz Joseph’s birthday party and the imperial shooting party. New sets and costumes were designed by Elin Steele, and historian Lucy Coatman was interviewed in the program.[16] Evan Loudon danced Rudolf on the opening night, with Sophie Martin as Mary Vetsera.

Ballet by Samuel Barber
For other uses, see Medea (disambiguation).
Medea, Op. 23, (1946) is a ballet suite by American composer Samuel Barber. It was commissioned by the Ditson Fund of Columbia University for Martha Graham and was premiered on 10 May 1946, at Columbia University's McMillin Theater, New York City.[1] The ballet was originally called Serpent Heart, but the work was revised in 1947 and retitled Cave of the Heart. Costumes were designed by Edythe Gilfond and the set was created by Isamu Noguchi. The original cast list included Graham, Erick Hawkins, Yuriko, May O'Donnell, and other members of the Martha Graham Dance Company.[2]
Although loosely based on Euripides' play Medea,[3] neither Barber nor Graham desired to use the legend literally in the ballet. Instead, these mythical figures served rather to project psychological states of jealousy and vengeance which are timeless. The choreography and music were conceived, as it were, on two time levels, the ancient mythical and the contemporary. Medea and Jason first appear as godlike, super-human figures of the Greek tragedy. As the tension and conflict between them increases, they step out of their legendary roles from time to time and become the modern man and woman, caught in the nets of jealousy and destructive love; and at the end resume their mythical quality. In both the dancing and music, archaic and contemporary idioms are used. Medea, in her final scene after the denouement, becomes once more the descendant of the sun.[1]
Beside Medea and Jason there are two other characters in the ballet, the Young Princess whom Jason marries out of ambition and for whom he betrays Medea, and an attendant who assumes the part of the onlooking chorus of the Greek tragedy, sympathizing, consoling and interpreting the actions of the major characters.

Medea Suite for Orchestra, Op. 23 (1947)[edit]
Early in 1947 Barber extracted from the ballet a seven-movement suite for full orchestra. Graham used the titles Serpent Heart and Cave of the Heart for her ballet, but the composer preferred to use the original source of the idea, the Medea-Jason legend, as the title for his suite.
Movements:

Parodos
Choros. Medea and Jason
The Young Princess. Jason
Choros
Medea
Kantikos Agonias
Exodos
The Suite was first performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra under Eugene Ormandy on 5 December 1947.[4]
Barber's Medea's Dance of Vengeance Op. 23a (1955) was derived from the work.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Mercury (Léonide Massine) slays Apollo (Boris Lisanevich) in the 1927 London revival of Mercure
Mercure (Mercury, or The Adventures of Mercury) is a 1924 ballet with music by Erik Satie. The original décor and costumes were designed by Pablo Picasso and the choreography was by Léonide Massine, who also danced the title role. Subtitled ""Plastic Poses in Three Tableaux"", it was an important link between Picasso's Neoclassical and Surrealist phases and has been described as a ""painter's ballet.""[1][2]
Mercure was commissioned by the Soirées de Paris stage company and first performed at the Théâtre de la Cigale in Paris on June 15, 1924. The conductor was Roger Désormière.


Background[edit]
Count Étienne de Beaumont
The Soirées de Paris was a short-lived attempt by Count Étienne de Beaumont (1883–1956) – socialite, balletomane, and patron of the arts – to rival Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes as an arbiter of Modernism in French theatre.[3][4] He was famed for the extravagant annual costume balls he hosted at his Paris mansion and had enjoyed some success financing theatrical ventures, notably the Darius Milhaud-Jean Cocteau ballet Le boeuf sur le toit (1920).[5] In late 1923, he rented the La Cigale music hall in Montmartre, hired former Diaghilev associate Massine as his choreographer and commissioned an eclectic group of dance and dramatic pieces utilizing the talents of authors Cocteau and Tristan Tzara, composers Milhaud and Henri Sauguet, artists Georges Braque, André Derain, and Marie Laurencin, and pioneer lighting designer Loie Fuller.[6] Beaumont's biggest coup was reuniting Massine with Picasso and Satie for their first stage collaboration since the scandalous, revolutionary Diaghilev ballet Parade (1917), and their work was anticipated as a highlight of the Soirées' inaugural season.
It was decided early on that Mercure would have no plot. The libretto has been variously attributed to Massine or Picasso, but the formal concept was Beaumont's. In a letter to Picasso dated February 21, 1924, Beaumont stated he wanted the ballet to be a series of tableaux vivants on a mythological theme, in a lighthearted manner suitable for a music hall. Beyond those stipulations he said, ""I don't want to drag literature into it, nor do I want the composer or the choreographer to do so...do whatever you want.""[7] Satie's input appears to have been decisive in selecting the ancient Roman god Mercury as the subject – and not entirely for artistic reasons.

Jean Cocteau
Conspicuously absent from the project was the fourth key member of the Parade team, Jean Cocteau. While Satie owed much of his postwar fame to Cocteau's promotional efforts on his behalf, he had never really gotten along with the man he described as ""a charming maniac.""[8] The author's increasingly exaggerated claims for his role in Parade's success were a particular source of annoyance for both Satie and Picasso.[9][10] In early 1924, just before creative talks for the Beaumont ballet got underway, Satie accused Cocteau of corrupting the morals of his onetime musical protégés Georges Auric and Francis Poulenc and severed ties with all three of them.[11] He made the break public in an article for Paris-Journal (February 15, 1924), in which he castigated Cocteau and referred to recent ballets by Auric and Poulenc as ""lots of syrupy things...buckets of musical lemonade.""[12] Auric used his position as music critic for Les Nouvelles littéraires to retaliate and for several months he and Satie took potshots at each other in the French press. Their feud would come to a climax at the Mercure opening.
It was known among the Paris cognoscenti that Cocteau personally identified with Mercury and all that the figure stood for.[4] He invariably attended costume balls (including Beaumont's) dressed as the deity, with silver tights, winged helmet and sandals, brandishing Mercury's wand as he darted among the other guests.[13] Furthermore, he had cast himself as Mercutio in his upcoming adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet for the Soirées. Since the ballet was supposed to be a mythological spoof, Satie and Picasso saw in Mercury an opportunity for some veiled mockery at Cocteau's expense.[4] In the final scenario, Mercury is presented as a meddlesome schemer who bounds onto the stage to cause trouble and chew the scenery. The in-jokes did not stop there: according to Belgian music critic Paul Collaer, the risqué supporting characters of the Three Graces – to be performed by men in drag with enormous fake breasts – were intended to represent Auric, Poulenc, and an arch-enemy of Satie's, the critic Louis Laloy.[14] The creators kept their work secret and Satie jokingly told the inquisitive he had no clue what the ballet was about.[15]

Mise-en-scène[edit]
Pablo Picasso, Montparnasse 1916 Picasso's commission for Mercure came at a turning point in his career. Although he commanded great respect among the avant-garde as the co-founder of Cubism, his postwar Neoclassical paintings had made him prosperous and fashionable. He had abandoned Montparnasse bohemianism for Right Bank high society, and there were grumblings among younger artists (especially the Dadaists) that he had ""sold out to the establishment.""[16] (His friend Max Jacob referred to this time as Picasso's ""duchess period"").[17] Now he was prepared to reassert his modernist credentials by creating a freer semi-abstract style, and chose this ballet as a suitably high-profile occasion in which to introduce it to the public.[18][3][19]
The drop curtain he designed featured patches of muted color (earth tones and pastel shades of blue, white and red) suggesting forms and landscape, over which the figures of a guitar-playing Harlequin and Pierrot with a violin were sinuously outlined in black. A lyre, the invention of Mercury, lies at their feet. A dimensional effect was created through dissociation of line and color. These principles were carried over into the largely monochrome backdrops and scenic constructions. Reliefs of painted rattan and wire were mounted onto large wooden cutouts with moveable parts, which hidden dancers shifted about the stage and manipulated along with the music. Some of them took the place of characters. The three-headed Cerberus was depicted on a circular shield beneath which only the dancer's feet were visible, and Massine described how the Three Graces were transformed into amorphous flats ""with plaited necks like telephone extension wires which stretched and contracted as their heads bobbed up and down.""[20] André Breton called these puppet-like objects ""tragic toys for adults.""[21] In counterpoint to the static poses of Massine's choreography, Picasso's mobile scenery became part of the dance.[20]
After seeing the ballet Gertrude Stein wrote, ""The scenery of Mercure... was written, quite simply written. There was no painting, it was pure calligraphy"".[22] Roland Penrose elaborated on this, tracing Picasso's inspiration beyond Cubism to his early gifts for contour drawing: ""From childhood... Picasso had enjoyed accomplishing the feat of drawing a figure or an animal with one continuous line. His ability to make a line twist itself into the illusion of a solid being, without taking pen from paper, had become an amazing act of virtuosity and a delight to watch. The costume drawings for Mercure are a masterly example of this kind of calligraphic drawing. With characteristic inventiveness, he had foreseen how they could be carried out on the stage... The results in terms of form and movement achieved with such simple means was a triumph.""[23]

Music[edit]
Erik Satie
In early 1924, Satie was at the height of his postwar cachet. He had produced little since his orchestral dance suite La belle excentrique (1921), but his role as ""precursor"" to Debussy and Ravel was acknowledged, as was his advocacy of young French composers (Les Six and the ""Arcueil School""). The March 1924 edition of La Revue musicale contained several laudatory articles about him, and that same month, he traveled to Belgium to give lectures on his music in Brussels and Antwerp.[24] Beaumont trusted him implicitly and his influence pervaded the Soirées de Paris: most of its leading artists were Satie's friends or disciples, including 25-year-old music director Désormière, whose first important engagement this was. Once Mercure was finished, Satie would immediately tackle another big commission from Rolf de Maré of the Ballets suédois; this resulted in his final compositions, the ballet Relâche and the score for its accompanying ""cinematographic interlude"", Entr'acte.
A love of calligraphy was not the only thing Satie shared with Picasso. He was a perceptive, lifelong enthusiast of avant-garde art, from Impressionism to Dada.[25] His friend Man Ray famously described him as ""the only musician who had eyes.""[26] During the creation of Parade in 1916, he found Picasso's ideas most inspiring and Cocteau was forced to change his original scenario accordingly.[27] On Mercure, Satie was able to work with the artist directly and used only the design sketches as his guide. In an interview shortly before the premiere, Satie described his aesthetic approach: ""You can imagine the marvelous contribution of Picasso, which I have attempted to translate musically. My aim has been to make the music an integral part, so to speak, with the actions and gestures of the people who move about in this simple exercise. You can see poses like them in any fairground. The spectacle is related quite simply to the music hall, without stylization, or any rapport with things artistic.""[28]
Satie evoked a music hall spirit by employing naïve-sounding themes (though their harmonies are not) and popular forms (march, waltz, polka), and in the occasional self-consciously ""humorous"" scoring. The melody of Signes du Zodiaque is given to the tuba, while the comic effect of the transvestite Bain des graces (Bath of The Graces) is heightened by being delicately scored for strings only. At the same time, the music steers clear of any direct narrative or illustrative impulses. Constant Lambert believed the best example of Mercure's abstract quality was the penultimate number Le chaos, ""a skillful blending of two previously heard movements, one the suave and sustained Nouvelle danse, the other the robust and snappy Polka des lettres. These two tunes are so disparate in mood that the effect, mentally speaking, is one of complete chaos; yet it is achieved by strictly musical and even academic means which consolidate the formal cohesion of the ballet as a whole.""[29]
The harmonious collaboration Satie enjoyed with Picasso was not shared with Massine. Mercure was originally planned as a work lasting eight minutes, but the score grew to nearly twice that length.[30] With two other substantial ballets (Milhaud's Salade and the Strauss adaptation Le Beau Danube) and several short divertissements to stage for the Soirées, Massine urged Satie to finish the music as quickly as possible. The fact that Satie borrowed an unpublished composition from his Schola Cantorum days, the Fugue-Valse (c. 1906), for the Danse de tendresse in Tableau I suggests he was indeed rushed by Massine.[30] The composer finally wrote to him on April 7, ""I can't possibly go any faster, mon cher Ami: I can't hand over to you work which I couldn't defend. You who are conscience personified will understand me.""[31] The piano score was completed on April 17 and the orchestration on May 9. Afterwards, Satie never forgave Massine for what he felt was the choreographer's attempt to compromise his work.[32]
Satie did not provide musical interludes to cover the scenery changes between the three tableaux. At the premiere, Désormière apparently repeated material from the ballet for this purpose, creating what Satie called ""false intermissions."" He demanded that the conductor follow the ""original version"" of the score so audiences would not misinterpret it, leaving the scene changes to take place in silence.[33]
Mercure is scored for an orchestra of modest proportions: 1 piccolo, 1 flute, 1 oboe, 2 clarinets in B♭,  1 bassoon, 2 horns in F, 2 trumpets in C, 1 trombone, 1 tuba, percussion for 2 players (snare drum, cymbals, bass drum), and strings.

Choreography[edit]
Léonide Massine, by Léon Bakst
One of Beaumont's objectives for the Soirées de Paris was to provide a comeback vehicle for Massine, who had been experiencing career difficulties since his acrimonious split from Diaghilev in 1921.[34] He was installed in an apartment at the Beaumont estate and given two large rooms for private rehearsal space.[35] Many of the dancers he employed had previously worked for the Ballets Russes, including the Soirées' female star Lydia Lopokova.

The former Beaumont mansion in the 7th arrondissement, where Massine held early rehearsals for the Soirées de Paris
Massine had little to say about Mercure in later years, acknowledging that it was predominately Picasso's work.[36] Surviving drawings reveal that Picasso designed actual groupings for the dancers – the ""living pictures"" demanded by Beaumont.[37] Regarding the choreography, Massine noted, ""As Mercury I had a series of adventures – intervening in the affairs of Apollo, directing the signs of the Zodiac, arranging the rape of Proserpine – each of which had to be clearly differentiated in order to strengthen the comic and dramatic content of the ballet.""[20] A review of a later production suggests that among the dancers he alone kept in constant motion: ""Through this series of plastic poses flew Mercury, a vivid figure in white tunic and scarlet coat, enthusiastically danced by Massine.""[38]


The Ballet[edit]
Satie called Mercure ""a purely decorative spectacle.""[39] The episodes and characters were loosely drawn from Roman and Greek mythology, except for the figures of Polichinelle (from Italian Commedia dell'arte) and the Philosopher in Tableau III.[40] Below is a list of the ballet's roles and musical numbers, and summaries of the stage action.
In the original production the Overture, a light, jaunty march, was played beneath Picasso's curtain before the ballet proper began. With the exception of the Danse de tendresse, each number lasts no more than a minute.

Premiere[edit]
La Cigale theatre in Paris, site of the scandalous premiere of Mercure on June 15, 1924
Mercure premiered on June 15, 1924 in a hostile atmosphere due to Parisian cultural infighting of the time. The audience was studded with cliques for and against Picasso, Satie, and Beaumont, as well as supporters of Diaghilev, whose Ballets Russes were performing across town at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. Most troublesome was the fledgeling Surrealist group led by André Breton and Louis Aragon. Breton was eager to win Picasso over to his cause and ready to use violence to defend his honor. During a Dada event the previous year (at which Satie was present), he responded to poet Pierre de Massot's verbal attack of Picasso by breaking Massot's arm with his walking stick.[43] He also had a personal score to settle with Satie, who had presided over Breton's 1922 mock-trial at the Closerie des Lilas restaurant for attempting to overthrow Tzara as leader of the Dadaists.[44] Georges Auric had become friendly with the Surrealists and exploited Breton's enmity to pressure them into disrupting the performance of Mercure.[45][46]
The ballet had scarcely begun when the Surrealists started chanting ""Bravo Picasso! Down with Satie!"" from the back of the theatre. Darius Milhaud argued with the Breton group, Satie fans voiced their support, and a handful of people approached Picasso's box and hurled insults at him.[47] By Tableau II, there was pandemonium in the hall and the curtain had to be lowered. Lydia Lopokova witnessed the events from the audience and quoted a protester proclaiming ""Only Picasso lives, down with Beaumont's garçons and the whole Soirées de Paris!""[48] When police arrived to eject the demonstrators, Surrealist Francis Gérard reproached Picasso: ""You see, Beaumont has the police throw us out because we were applauding you!""[16] Louis Aragon, still raging against Satie, managed to jump onto the stage and shout, ""In the name of God, down with the cops!"" before he was dragged off.[49][50] Order was finally restored and the ballet allowed to continue.
The Surrealists not taken into custody waited outside the venue, evidently hoping to see Picasso after the performance. Instead, they encountered Satie on his way out. The composer later reassured  Milhaud, ""They didn't say a word to me.""[51]
Five more performances of Mercure through June 22 passed without incident.

Reception[edit]
Mercure was coolly received by the public and mainstream press. Maurice Boucher of Le Monde musical remarked that despite the opening night demonstration, there was little to get upset about. He dismissed Satie's music as ""the ordinary pom-pom of the music hall"" and attributed the minimalism of Picasso's décor to poverty of imagination – and, perhaps, a little drunkenness.[52]

André Breton in 1924
The Surrealists seized on this indifference to write a ""Tribute to Picasso"", published in the June 20 issue of Paris-Journal and subsequently reprinted in several periodicals:

It is our duty to put on record our deep and wholehearted admiration for Picasso who goes on creating a troubling modernity at the highest level of expression. Once again, in Mercure, he has shown a full measure of his daring and his genius, and has met with a total lack of understanding. This event proves that Picasso, far more than any of those around him, is today the eternal personification of youth and the absolute master of the situation.[53][54]
It was signed by Breton and 14 other artists and writers, including Aragon, Max Ernst, and Philippe Soupault. Renegade Dadaist Francis Picabia ridiculed this homage with a quip comparing Picasso's ""troubling modernity"" to the outdated fashions of designer Paul Poiret, causing Aragon to counter with his own statement: ""I think that nothing stronger than this ballet has ever been presented in the theatre. It is the revelation of an entirely new manner by Picasso, which owes nothing to cubism or realism and which surpasses cubism just as it does realism.""[55] The American journal The Little Review agreed that Picasso was the star of the show: ""In Mercure the musician and the choreographer served purely as accompaniment to the painter. They felt this, and with remarkable art they acquiesced to this hegemony.""[56] Debates over the significance of Picasso's décor continued for weeks, including illustrated coverage in the July 1, 1924 issue of Vogue, which gave it the imprimatur of the haut monde.[57][58]
In its attempt to distance Picasso from his collaborators, the Surrealist ""Tribute"" sparked false rumors that Satie had fallen out with him as he had with so many other friends, due to his hypersensitive personality.[59] Satie addressed this in a June 21 letter to Wieland Mayr, editor of the literary review les feuilles libres: ""Believe me, there is no divergence of views between Picasso and me. It's all a 'gimmick' by my old friend, the famous writer Bretuchon [Breton] (who came to create a disturbance and attract attention by his shabby appearance and deplorable rudeness). Yes.""[60]
Picasso kept publicly aloof from the fray, but the Surrealists had gotten his attention. He annotated and saved a copy of their ""Tribute"".[55]

Aftermath[edit]
Novice impresario Beaumont was a poor organizer.[61] Performances by the Soirées de Paris were marked by last-minute cancellations, abrupt changes of program, and on one night, a musicians' strike just as the curtain was about to go up.[62] Reviews were mixed at best (with Massine getting most of the praise) and the enterprise lost money.[63] The season was scheduled to run through June 30, including performances of Mercure on June 26, 27 and 28,[64] but after June 22, the Soirées abruptly ceased without notice.[65] Beaumont left his idle company in limbo for days before finally disbanding it.[66]  On June 29, Satie reported this to Rolf de Maré: ""The Cigale (Beaumont) has closed its doors...This poor Count – who is, after all, a good man – instead of compliments has only received insults and other nice things... That's life! Most consoling!""[67]
The Soirées de Paris was never revived, but its brief existence had a notable impact on the careers of several of those involved. Beaumont himself continued to dabble in ballet. He wrote the libretto and designed the décor for Massine's popular Offenbach adaptation Gaîté Parisienne (1938).[68]
Mercure was Picasso's last major work for the theatre,[69] bringing to a close a momentous period of involvement in the ballet world that had begun with Parade eight years earlier.[70]  Always aiming to reinvent himself as an artist, he was quick to recognize the potential benefits of associating with Breton and his colleagues. Mercure was the catalyst for this. According to Michael C. FitzGerald, ""With Picasso's reputation in danger of losing its avant-garde edge, the Surrealists' intervention publicly restored Picasso to his accustomed position. During the following decade, Surrealism would be a primary inspiration for his art and the principal context for its public reception.""[55]
The Soirées did succeed in re-launching Massine in Paris. He was soon reconciled with Diaghilev and welcomed back to the Ballets Russes as a ""guest choreographer"" in January 1925, remaining with them through 1928. Diaghilev also hired Désormière as principal conductor for his troupe's final years (1925-1929).
Cocteau was deeply offended by Mercure,[46] though he was careful to maintain his friendship with Picasso. In 1925, he wrote his play Orphée, updating the title character into a famous but beleaguered Parisian poet. From then on, the figure of Orpheus replaced Mercury in his personal mythos.[71]
Satie fared the worst in this undertaking. Poet and critic Rene Chalupt reported that even some of the composer's closest friends were disappointed by his music.[72] Mercure set in motion a critical backlash against Satie that would reach fever pitch with the premiere of the Dadaist Relâche in December 1924, and was hardly quelled by his death eight months later. The irreverence and perceived flippancy of these last two ballets galvanized his enemies and disillusioned many supporters who had championed him as a serious composer, with long-term negative effects on his posthumous reputation.[73][74]

Revivals[edit]
Serge Diaghilev
Diaghilev was disconcerted by the Soirées de Paris, not least because some of its artists were working for him at the same time.[75] He called it ""a soirée of the Ballets Russes in which the only thing missing is my name.""[76] But he attended its performances, and the originality of Mercure left him, according to Serge Lifar, ""pale, agitated, nervous.""[77] In 1926, he took the unprecedented step of acquiring Mercure from Beaumont – the only time in his career that Diaghilev bought a ballet ready-made.[63] The Ballets Russes presented it three times during its 1927 season: on June 2 at the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt in Paris, and on July 11 and July 19 at the Prince's Theatre in London.[78] Massine recreated his choreography and role as Mercury. Constant Lambert found it ""extremely funny but oddly beautiful"",[79] opinions not shared by London critics. The Times reviewer thought Satie's music and Picasso's ""ridiculous contraptions"" were outmoded,[80] while dance historian and critic Cyril Beaumont wrote, ""The whole thing appeared incredibly stupid, vulgar, and pointless.""[52]  It was never again staged in its original form.[81]
By that time, Satie's score had already provided the basis for another ballet in the United States. Former Ballets Russes dancer Adolph Bolm and his Chicago Allied Arts company presented it in 1926 under the title Parnassus on Montmartre, with a new text about Parisian art students at a masquerade. Ruth Page starred.[82]

Constant Lambert was an early English champion of Satie's music, including Mercure
London's Ballet Rambert mounted a more faithful version at the Lyric Theatre, Hammersmith on June 22, 1931. Frederick Ashton choreographed and danced Mercury, Tamara Karsavina guest-starred as Venus, and William Chappell portrayed Apollo.[83] Constant Lambert revived Ashton's production for the Camargo Society at the Savoy Theatre in London on June 27, 1932, with Walter Gore and Alicia Markova as Mercury and Venus (renamed Terpsichore).[79] Lambert also conducted a radio broadcast of Satie's music for Mercure over the BBC on July 13, 1932,[79] and wrote admiringly of it in his book Music Ho! A Study of Music in Decline (1934).[29]
An adaptation entitled The Home Life of The Gods was produced by the Littlefield Ballet in Philadelphia in December 1936. The choreography was by Lasar Galpern.[84]
Since World War II, Mercure has existed primarily as a concert piece. Désormière kept it in his repertoire and there is a live recording (December 2, 1947) of him performing it with the Orchestre National de France. Lambert broadcast Mercure again with the London Symphony Orchestra on June 14, 1949, as part of a three-concert Satie series he conducted for the BBC Third Programme.[85] Apart from Satie's score (first published in 1930), all that survives of the original production are Picasso's drop curtain and a few design sketches and photographs. The curtain was restored in 1998 and is on display at the Musée National d'Art Moderne in Paris. A woven tapestry replica, authorized by the artist in the late 1960s, hangs in the lobby of the 1251 Avenue of the Americas building in Manhattan.
In 1980, composer Harrison Birtwistle published his own instrumental arrangement of Mercure, echoing a long-held (and disputed) opinion that Satie lacked skill as an orchestrator.[86][87]


Recordings[edit]
Mercure is the least known of Satie's three major ballets and has had comparatively few commercial recordings. Among them are renditions by conductors Maurice Abravanel (Vanguard, 1968), Pierre Dervaux (EMI, 1972), Bernard Herrmann (Decca, 1973), Ronald Corp (Musical Heritage Society, 1993, reissued by Hyperion in 2004), and Jérôme Kaltenbach (Naxos, 1999).

The first movement features a male soloist, two female demi-soloists, four male demi-soloists and a corps de ballet of twelve women. The second movement is a pas de deux. The entire cast then return to the stage for the final movement.[1]
Mercurial Manoeuvres was made as part of the New York City Ballet's Diamond Project. The original cast includes Miranda Weese, Jock Soto, Edwaard Liang, Audrey Morgan and Elena Diner.[1] When the ballet was made, Wheeldon was dancing with the company as a soloist.[1] He retired from performing after Mercurial Manoeuvres to become a full-time choreographer.[2]
In 2020, in response to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, the New York City Ballet will release a 2017 video recording of the pas de deux from Mercurial Manoeuvres, featuring Tiler Peck and Tyler Angle.[3]

The Merry Widow ballet is a 1975 adaptation of Franz Lehár's 1905 romantic operetta The Merry Widow (Die lustige Witwe).
John Lanchbery and Alan Abbott adapted the score of the operetta for ballet and retained the style of Lehár's orchestration.  The arrangement includes the well-known tunes of the operetta: Vilja's song Ich bin eine anständige Frau and the Weibermarsch. This musical arrangement has been used for two ballets: the first was choreographed by Ronald Hynd for The Australian Ballet in 1975, while the second was choreographed by Veronica Paeper for CAPAB (since renamed the Cape Town City Ballet Company) in 1988.


Ballet choreographed by Ronald Hynd[edit]
The ballet was created for The Australian Ballet by Sir Robert Helpmann (a principal dancer and choreographer), who obtained permission from the heirs of the composer and the librettists (Viktor Léon and Leo Stein), by special arrangement with Glocken Verlag Ltd. of London. The scenario and staging were designed by Helpmann, with the choreography by Ronald Hynd.  The orchestration was by John Lanchbery (who was then the musical director of The Australian Ballet) and his colleague Alan Abbott. The designer was Desmond Heeley.
The ballet had its world premiere on 13 November 1975 at the Palais Theatre in Melbourne, with Marilyn Rowe (Hanna), John Meehan (Danilo), Lucette Aldous (Valencienne), Kelvin Coe (Camille), Colin Peasley (Baron Mirko Zeta) and Ray Powell (Njegus). The performance was conducted by John Lanchbery. It premiered in Sydney at the Regent Theatre.
In 1976, Dame Margot Fonteyn performed the rôle of Hanna as a guest dancer at The Australian Ballet and continued with the rôle, alternating with Marilyn Fay Jones when the company took their production to England.
Like the operetta, the ballet has also become very popular and has been adopted into the repertoires of many companies, including the National Ballet of Canada, the Royal Danish Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre, the Houston Ballet, the Vienna State Ballet, and Pacific Northwest Ballet.

Ballet choreographed by Veronica Paeper[edit]
Veronica Paeper choreographed a new version of this ballet to the orchestration of John Lanchbery. The ballet had its premiere on 10 September 1988 at the Artscape Theatre Centre, formerly known as the Nico Malan Opera House, in Cape Town, South Africa. The Cape Town City Ballet revived this version in 2008; the principal rôles were danced by guest artists Elza Leimane and Raimond Martinov.

Synopsis[edit]
Act 1[edit]
Scene 1[edit]
An ante-room in the Pontevedrian Embassy in Paris in 1905
A ball is to be held that evening at the Pontevedrian Embassy to celebrate the birthday of the Grand Duke, the sovereign of the Grand Duchy of Pontevedro, and Kromow and Pritschitsch are keen to leave their desk work and join the festivities. Camille is also anxious to leave work. However, before they can leave, Njegus arrives and instructs the three men to return to the desk to take care of some extra papers he is carrying. Discovering that Danilo is missing, Njegus enquires where he is, and Kromow and Pritschitsch comment that Danilo is out drinking. Njegus sits at Danilo's post at the desk, and together the four men go through the paperwork, following which Njegus informs them that Pontevedro is bankrupt. Baron Zeta arrives, carrying a telegram and mentioning that a rich Pontevedrian widow, Hanna Glawari, is to attend the embassy ball. The Baron wants Count Danilo to marry the widow so that her money will stay in Pontevedro. Valencienne comes into the room and then everyone drinks to the health of the Duke. The men then leave — except for Camille, who has some extra paperwork to do.
Valencienne, who has deliberately lagged behind the others in their departure, flirts with Camille, trying to distract him from his work.  Camille tries to keep on working, but eventually gives up and goes to Valencienne — and then Valencienne half-heartedly keeps showing Camille her wedding ring.  While the couple are flirting, Njegus, who has some further work to do, comes back into the room unnoticed, and without noticing the lovers. Suddenly becoming aware of the presence of Camille and Valencienne, Njegus hides in a cupboard underneath the desk. The couple end up on the desk with Camille kissing Valencienne and the two hugging each other, at which point Njegus suddenly confronts them, much to their surprise and embarrassment. Camille leaves immediately. Valencienne pleads with Njegus to keep what he has seen a secret — to which Njegus agrees — and then Valencienne also leaves.
While Njegus is finishing his tasks, Danilo enters the room, having just arrived from Maxim's.  Danilo is drunk and is finding it difficult to stand without falling over. Baron Zeta and Valencienne then enter the room — and the Baron, seeing that Danilo has returned to the embassy, attempts, unavailingly, to tell Danilo that he is to marry a wealthy widow. Finally giving up, the Baron asks Njegus to sober Danilo up before the ball.

Scene 2[edit]
The Ballroom in the Pontevedrian Embassy
The ball begins and Baron Zeta dances with his beautiful wife. However, he has trouble with  rheumatism and he asks Camille to dance with Valencienne in his place. Camille does so with enthusiasm, and Njegus, who is watching the pair closely, is unimpressed by the open display of Camille's and Valencienne's affection for each other. The Baron does not seem to notice anything amiss, but he does get upset at the amount of time the two of them dance together, and he makes an effort to remind Camille that Valencienne is married to him.
The widow, Hanna Glawari, arrives, amidst a stir from the hopeful young bachelors.  Baron Zeta introduces Hanna to Danilo, not knowing that Hanna and Danilo had previously been romantically involved with each other.  Both Hanna and Danilo are stunned to see each other.  Danilo is thrilled, and tells Hanna that he loves her, but Hanna accuses him of only wanting her for her money.  Upset about this, Danilo mops the sweat from his forehead with a kerchief, which Hanna instantly recognises as a keepsake she had given to Danilo the last time they had seen each other (when Danilo's aristocratic uncle had forbidden their romance and had forbidden Danilo to marry Hanna, because Hanna was a poor peasant girl).  Hanna takes back the kerchief from Danilo and then leaves the room.  Danilo remembers Hanna the way she used to be — as a young peasant girl — and he remembers, with fondness, the way she had given him the kerchief - these memories are danced as a pas de deux.
When Danilo returns to the ballroom, it is time for the 'ladies choice' dance. Hanna chooses Danilo to dance with, and curtsies to him, expectantly, but, still upset with what Hanna had said to him, Danilo snubs her and dances with somebody else. Feeling hurt because of Danilo's actions, Hanna dances with Camille — an action which upsets Valencienne. Valencienne and Danilo then dance together, and they effect a change of partners. Before Hanna can react, Valencienne and Camille go off together. Eventually, though, Hanna dances with Danilo.

Act 2[edit]
The garden of Hanna's Villa
The following night, Hanna gives a party in the garden of her Parisian villa, and she and all her guests wear Pontevedrian clothes, so that they can celebrate the birthday of the Grand Duke in Pontevedrian fashion.  There are many Pontevedrian folk dances, including one in which Danilo and Hanna dance together — at the end of which Hanna mops her forehead with her kerchief.  Later, Hanna returns the kerchief to Danilo in exactly the same way as she had originally given it to him, following which both leave the garden.
Entering the garden together, Camille and Valencienne are no longer concealing their passion for each other.  Camille entices Valencienne to enter the pavilion in the garden with him.  Njegus, arriving for a meeting in the pavilion with the Baron and Danilo, sees what happens and goes to the pavilion door to peep though the keyhole.  Baron Zeta and Danilo arrive, and, seeing Njegus at the door, they go to join him, as they think that Njegus is opening the door. Njegus quickly locks the door, and, when Baron Zeta and Danilo find the door is locked, they demand he unlock the door for them. Njegus refuses to do so.  As the Baron and Danilo discuss what to do with Njegus, he breaks away from them and looks around desperately for help.  Seeing Hanna, who has just arrived in the area, Njegus explains the situation to her and asks her to change places with Valencienne in the pavilion. Hanna agrees to do so.
Baron Zeta and Danilo catch up with Njegus, and demand that he hand them the key.  Shaking his head in refusal, Njegus puts the key in his mouth. Baron Zeta and Danilo pick up Njegus and hold him upside down and shake him until the key drops onto the ground. Baron Zeta picks up the key and he and Danilo then go to the door of the pavilion.
Meanwhile, Hanna changes places with Valencienne through a door on the other side of the pavilion.  Hanna presumably explains to Valencienne what is going on, and the escaped Valencienne joins a returning group of friends, so that she will appear innocent.
The Baron opens the door and Camille leaves the pavilion, followed by Hanna. Danilo is stunned to see that Hanna is the woman with Camille, and Hanna states that she and Camille are engaged. Camille looks startled at this unexpected announcement and Valencienne faints with shock at her lover committing himself to another woman. Baron Zeta is horrified at the thought of Pontevedro losing all Hanna's money to a foreigner and also faints. Danilo is furious. Hanna explains to Camille why she pretended that they were engaged, and Camille, looking relieved, smiles.
Baron Zeta, Valencienne and Njegus then leave in a huff.  All the guests congratulate Hanna and Camille on their 'engagement' and then leave — followed by the swift departure of Camille.  Finally, the jealous Danilo throws down the kerchief and storms off in a rage. The delighted Hanna then picks up the kerchief knowing that Danilo truly loves her.

Act 3[edit]
Chez Maxim
The maître d' is welcoming his patrons as they arrive, and the waiter rushes around serving drinks.
Camille arrives.  Shortly after, Baron Zeta, Valencienne and Njegus arrive, and they openly show their contempt for Camille.
With the fear that Pontevedro will become bankrupt as a result of Hanna's marriage to a non-Pontevedrian, Njegus and Zeta lower the Pontevedrian flags.
Soon after, Danilo arrives and is aggressively approached by Camille.  The two men fight, in the middle of which they are both restrained. Then Hanna arrives and, when she accepts the arm of Camille, Danilo wants to hit Camille with his gloves and challenge Camille to a duel. Baron Zeta's eyes are finally opened to what is happening between Camille and Valencienne, when Valencienne shields Camille from the angry Danilo.
Hanna dances with Camille, while Danilo dances with Valencienne. Gradually, however, the dance brings Hanna and Danilo together — and Camille and Valencienne likewise end up together.  Resignedly, the upset Baron accepts the romance between his wife and Camille, and the three leave together.
Hanna is left alone in the room, feeling dejected. Then Danilo quietly returns and folds Hanna in his arms, and all ends in blissful happiness. Njegus and Zeta, who have also quietly returned to the room, are delighted at the outcome and raise the Pontevedrian flags on either side of the stage in celebration.

Television broadcast[edit]
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC-TV) recorded a live performance by the Australian Ballet, at Melbourne's State Theatre, on 25 June 1993, with Lisa Pavane (as Hanna Galwari), Steven Heathcote (Count Danilo Danilovitsch), Rebecca Yates (Valencienne), David McAllister (Camille de Rosillon), Colin Peasley (Baron Mirko Zeta), and Ray Powell (Njegus). The ABC broadcast the recording on 27 March 1997, and released it as a video and DVD.

239,Miracle in the Gorbals,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miracle_in_the_Gorbals,"Miracle in the Gorbals , Arthur Bliss , 1944","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Miracle in the Gorbals (1944) is a one-act ballet choreographed by Robert Helpmann to a story by Michael Benthall, with music by Arthur Bliss. The setting is the 1940s slums in the Gorbals area of Glasgow. It became a staple of the Royal Ballet, performed each season from 1944 to 1950 and receiving a revival in 1958.


Background[edit]
The idea for the scenario for Miracle in the Gorbals came to Michael Benthall while he was working on a gun site in Glasgow. He worked on a detailed story and the characters, discussing the action with dancer and choreographer Robert Helpmann. The next collaborator to be identified was the designer, Edward Burra.[1] The composer Arthur Bliss set to work on the score, with scenario and initial designs before him.[2] The Royal Ballet performed the ballet every season from 1944 to 1950 and revived it in 1958,[3] but it did not perform it in Glasgow itself when touring Scotland in 1945.[2] They also performed the ballet in Paris.[3]
Bliss wrote the music in 1943 after his return from the United States.  He created a concert suite from the ballet music, choosing seven of the fifteen numbers in the ballet, as well as the overture (The Street, The Girl Suicide, The Young Lovers, The Stranger, Dance of Deliverance, Intermezzo, Finale: The Killing of the Stranger).[4]
Thanks to the efforts of David Drew[citation needed], a dancer with the Royal Ballet for over 50 years, the ballet was revived in 2014 by the Birmingham Royal Ballet, under the direction of Gillian Lynne, a member of the original cast.

Original cast[edit]
The ballet was first produced by the Sadler's Wells Ballet at the Prince's Theatre in London on Thursday, 26 October 1944.  The choreography was by Robert Helpmann, who danced the lead role of the Stranger, and the music was conducted by Constant Lambert. The first cast was:

Pauline Clayden (The Suicide)
Moira Shearer and Alexis Rassine (The Lovers)
Leslie Edwards (A Beggar)
Gordon Hamilton (A Street Urchin)
David Paltenghi (The Official)
Celia Franca (The Prostitute)
Robert Helpmann (The Stranger)
The corps (residents of the Gorbals) included Julia Farron, Moyra Fraser, Gerd Larsen, Gillian Lynne and Stanley Holden.[2]

Synopsis[edit]
The front cloth shows a rainswept ship in a dry dock with vast cranes in the background. The first scene in the slum is set in the afternoon, with a pub 'The Shamrock' on the left and on the right a fish and chip shop 'Mac's'; tenements crowd in on either side. Urchins are playing, but they run off when scolded by a minister. Evening approaches, and the prostitute comes out, and young men follow her around. The minister and the prostitute meet; he turns away and she goes into a doorway with a young man. A girl enters, but goes off after seeing a group of drunks. Two lovers come on and dance; the prostitute emerges and tries to entice the man, but the re-appearance of the minister foils her.
An old beggar and some children pass news around a gathering crowd; the minister faces the audience. Two men carry in the body of the suicide. The minister crosses her hands and the crowd feels the certainty of her death. A stranger enters, the crowd parts and he is left with the suicide's body. After he bends over the body, the girl rises, and she slowly warms to rebirth and starts dancing. The stranger is acclaimed, but the minister is disturbed, resentful of his loss of authority. The stranger blesses the crowd, and he leaves the scene with the revived girl.
The minister sends a child to spy on the stranger, when the prostitute walks by. The minister follows her up some stairs as she glories in her success. The people return to the street in excitement at the miracle. The minister comes back down the stairs, and the two lovers say good-night. The urchin brings news back to the minister, and the stranger is sent to the prostitute's room on a supposed mercy errand. The minister poisons the thoughts of the people, predicting that the stranger will emerge from the prostitute's room. Although initially stirred, the crowd are silent when the stranger re-emerges; only the beggar is aware of the plot and retreats to a doorway. After the stranger has left, the prostitute appears in a more lyrical frame of mind, as if having visions. The minister next summons a gang of thugs, who loiter in dark alleys. As the stranger comes back, he offers no resistance; they jostle him, slash him with knives and kick him to the ground, where the silence is broken by the sound of a distant ship siren. The minister realises the horror of what he has done. The beggar goes to help the stranger, and he is joined by the prostitute and the suicide, before the two women leave the beggar alone with the stranger.[2]

Pantomime ballet by Béla Bartók
A csodálatos mandarinThe Miraculous MandarinBéla Bartók in 1927MusicBéla BartókBased on1916 story by Melchior LengyelPremiere27 November 1926 (1926-11-27)Cologne Opera
The Miraculous Mandarin (Hungarian: A csodálatos mandarin, pronounced [ˈɒ ˈt͡ʃodaːlɒtoʃ ˈmɒndɒrin]; German: Der wunderbare Mandarin) Op. 19, Sz. 73 (BB 82), is a one act pantomime ballet composed by Béla Bartók between 1918 and 1924, and based on the 1916 story by Melchior Lengyel.[1] Premiered on 27 November 1926 conducted by Eugen Szenkar at the Cologne Opera, Germany, it caused a scandal and was subsequently banned on moral grounds.[2][3][4] Although more successful at its Prague premiere, it was generally performed during the rest of Bartók's life in the form of a concert suite, which preserves about two-thirds of the original pantomime's music.


Synopsis[edit]
Beginning—Curtain rises
First seduction game
Second seduction game
Third seduction game—the Mandarin enters
Dance of the girl
The chase—the tramps leap out
Suddenly the Mandarin's head appears
The Mandarin falls to the floor
After an orchestral introduction depicting the chaos of the big city, the action begins in a room belonging to three tramps. They search their pockets and drawers for money, but find none. They then force a girl to stand by the window and attract passing men into the room. The girl begins a lockspiel—a ""decoy game"", or saucy dance. She first attracts a shabby old rake, who makes comical romantic gestures. The girl asks, ""Got any money?"" He replies, ""Who needs money? All that matters is love."" He begins to pursue the girl, growing more and more insistent until the tramps seize him and throw him out.
The girl goes back to the window and performs a second lockspiel. This time, she attracts a shy young man, who also has no money. He begins to dance with the girl. The dance grows more passionate, then the tramps jump him and throw him out too.
The girl goes to the window again and begins her dance. The tramps and girl see a bizarre figure in the street, soon heard coming up the stairs. The tramps hide, and the figure, a mandarin (wealthy Chinese man), stands immobile in the doorway. The tramps urge the girl to lure him closer. She begins another saucy dance, the Mandarin's passions slowly rising. Suddenly, he leaps up and embraces the girl. They struggle and she escapes; he begins to chase her. The tramps leap on him, strip him of his valuables, and attempt to suffocate him under pillows and blankets. However, he continues to stare at the girl. They stab him three times with a rusty sword; he almost falls, but throws himself again at the girl. The tramps grab him again and hang him from a lamp hook. The lamp falls, plunging the room into darkness, and the Mandarin's body begins to glow with an eerie blue-green light. The tramps and girl are terrified. Suddenly, the girl knows what they must do. She tells the tramps to release the Mandarin; they do. He leaps at the girl again, and this time she does not resist and they embrace. With the Mandarin's longing fulfilled, his wounds begin to bleed and he dies.

Music[edit]
The score begins with an orchestral depiction of the ""concrete jungle."" The violins have rapidly rising and falling, wave-like scales over the very unusual interval of an augmented octave. One of the central motifs of the work is set forward in bar 3—a 68 rhythm in minor seconds. This motif will reappear at the violent actions of the tramps. The sound of car horns is imitated by fanfares on the trumpets and trombones. As the curtain rises, the violas play a wide-leaping theme that will be associated both with the tramps and the girl. The 3 lockspiele are scored for the clarinet, each one longer and more florid than the last. The old rake is represented by trombone glissandi spanning a minor third, another very important interval. As the tramps throw him out, the minor second in 68 returns. The music for the shy young man is a slow dance in 54, also interrupted by the 68 minor second as the tramps throw him out. When the Mandarin is heard in the street, the trombone plays a simple pentatonic theme harmonized by 3 lines of parallel tritones in the other trombones and the tuba. When the Mandarin enters the room, the trombones and tuba play downward glissandos, again spanning a minor third. Three measures later, this interval is played fortississimo by the full brass.
The girl's dance for the Mandarin contains both a waltz and the viola theme associated with her and the tramps. When the Mandarin seizes the girl, the minor second is heard again. The chase is represented by a fugue, whose subject also has a pentatonic flavor. The concert suite ends at this point. In the complete ballet, the 68 minor second returns again as the tramps rob the Mandarin. The attempted suffocation and stabbing are illustrated with great force in the orchestra. As the tramps hang the Mandarin from the lamp, the texture is blurred with glissandi on trombones, timpani, piano and cellos. The glowing body of the Mandarin is represented by the entry of a chorus singing wordlessly, once again in the interval of a minor third. The climax, after the girl embraces the Mandarin, is a theme given out fortissimo by the low brass against minor-second tremolos in the woodwinds. As the Mandarin begins to bleed, the downward minor-third glissando heard at his entry is echoed in the trombone, contrabassoon and low strings. The work then stutters arhythmically to a close.
The scoring is generally heavy, and Bartók employs many colorful techniques here, including chromatic scales, trills and tremolos in the woodwinds; glissandi in the horns, trombones and tuba; cluster chords and tremolos on the piano; scales and arpeggios on the piano, harp and celeste; and scales, double stops, trills, tremolos, and glissandi in the strings. Other special effects include fluttertonguing in the flutes; muting the brasses and strings, a cymbal roll a deux (a cymbal crash followed by scraping the plates together); playing the bass drum with the wooden part of a timpani mallet; a roll on the gong; rolled timpani glissandi; string harmonics; col legno and sul ponticello playing in the strings; scordatura in the cellos; and, at one point, quarter-tones in the violins.
In 2000 a new edition edited by Peter Bartók, the composer's son, was published.  Based on the composer's written manuscripts, corrections, and the concurrently written score for piano with four hands, it restored a considerable amount of previously lost music.

Instrumentation[edit]
The Miraculous Mandarin is scored for three flutes (2nd and 3rd doubling piccolo), three oboes (3rd doubling English horn), three clarinets (second doubling E-flat clarinet and third doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (second and third doubling contrabassoon), four horns (second and fourth doubling Wagner tuba), three trumpets in C, three trombones, bass tuba, timpani, snare drum, tenor drum, bass drum, cymbals, triangle, tam-tam, xylophone, celesta, harp, piano, organ, choir, and strings.

Recordings[edit]
Performances of the ballet suite outnumbered performances of the complete ballet until recent years. Recordings of the suite include:

Antal Doráti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (1953)
Eugene Ormandy with the Philadelphia Orchestra
Seiji Ozawa with the Boston Symphony Orchestra
Esa-Pekka Salonen with the Los Angeles Philharmonic
Zubin Mehta with the Berlin Philharmonic
Jean Martinon with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra
Susanna Mälkki with the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra
David Robertson with the New York Philharmonic
Notable recordings of the complete ballet include:

The landmark 1983 performance of the complete ballet by Hungarian conductor Antal Doráti, a friend of the composer's, with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra brought the complete score to the attention of a wider public. Performances of the complete ballet have grown in the years since.
Iván Fischer with the Budapest Festival Orchestra (This recording received the 1998 Gramophone Award in the Orchestral category.[5])

1940 ballet by William Grant Still


William Grant Still in 1949, photographed by Carl Van Vechten
Miss Sally's Party is a 1940 ballet composition in eight-movements by American composer William Grant Still.[1] A related libretto was written by Verna Arvey, wife of composer Still. The ballet was first performed on May 2, 1941, and is about nineteen minutes long.[2][3]


Overview[edit]
A description of the ballet is well presented as follows:

The highlight of Miss Sally's party is a cake. The origin of the dance of that name, a cake walk is a dancing contest, so named because the prize is sometimes a cake. The leading contestants for the cake are Jim Slick and Jake, the latter being Miss Sally's boyfriend. Jim Slick, a strutting braggart, intercepts two mischievous boys who were sneaking up to the cake, warning them not to swipe any of ""his"" prize. As the contest progresses (to the strains of an irresistible example of the ""cakewalk"") it appears that Jim is the best. But just before the last dance, the boys slip a frog down the back of his shirt, causing him to twitch and jump and miss his steps, so Jake and Sally win the prize.[3]— Joseph Stevenson, AllMusic
Movements[edit]
The ballet is in eight movements as follows:

Mlada is a ballet in 4 Acts/9 Scenes, with choreography by Marius Petipa, and music by Ludwig Minkus.
The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on December 2/14 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1879 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. Principal dancers: Eugeniia Sokolova (as Mlada), Felix Kschessinsky (as Mstivoi, Prince Ratarskii), and Mariia Gorsjenkova (as Princess Voislava).

Revivals and restagings[edit]
Revival by Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet in 4 Acts/6 Scenes. First presented on September 25/October 7, 1896 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. Principal dancers: Mathilde Kschessinskaya (as Mlada), Felix Kschessinsky (as Mstivoi, Prince Rataskii), Marie Petipa (as Princess Voislava), Pavel Gerdt (as Iaromir, Prince Arkonskii), Nadezhda Petipa (as Sviatokhna), and Alexander Shiraev (as the Jester).[1]

Notes[edit]
In the 1870's the composers César Cui, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, Modest Mussorgsky, and Alexander Borodin, known as ""The Mighty Handful"", had intended to produce an opera based on the same libretto and under the same title for premiere in 1872, with Minkus scoring the music for the ballet sections. However the project was aborted, even though the music had been, for the most part, completed, and most of the composers who contributed to the score re-used their music for later works. When scoring the music for Petipa's 1879 ballet adaptation, Minkus utilized the music he had scored for the aborted project.

243,Monotones,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotones_(ballet%29,"Monotones , to music by Erik Satie , 1965","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Monotones is a one-act ballet in two parts choreographed by Frederick Ashton to music by Erik Satie.
Monotones II was created first as a gala piece for a gala performance in aid of the Royal Ballet Benevolent Fund in 1965. Ashton had long been inspired by the Gymnopedies by Erik Satie of 1888 and took orchestrations by Claude Debussy and Roland-Manuel as the basis of a pas de trois for two men and one woman. The premiere was on 24 March 1965 with Vyvyan Lorrayne, Anthony Dowell, and Robert Mead. 
The piece was a great success – so much so that in 1966 Ashton enlarged the piece so that it would be long enough to be performed in the normal repertory, by the addition of Monotones I, which formed an overture to the earlier work. This piece in many ways forms a mirror image of Monotones II. Based on Satie's Gnossiennes, it is another pas de trois, but in this case for two women and one man; the premiere was given by Antoinette Sibley, Georgina Parkinson, and Brian Shaw.
Ashton took his cues in choreographing the ballet from the form, structure and inspiration of Satie's music. The ternary structure of the Gymnopedies and Gnossiennes supports what has been referred to as a ""trinitarian obsession"" of Ashton's.[1] The two sections of the work also represent a contrast between the earthiness of the Gnossiennes in Monotones I – where the characters wear green costumes, engage in weighty and accented lunges, and shield their eyes from the sun – and the celestial, infinite and seamless qualities of the Gymnopedies in Monotones II, where the dancers are white-costumed, lit from above, and perform suspended arabesques, the men lifting the woman to ""walk on air.""[2][3][4]
The work uses classical language in its choreography and, like his Symphonic Variations, represents a pinnacle of Ashton's own classicism.[5]
On his death, Ashton's will left the ballet to the care of Tony Dyson, now chairman of the Frederick Ashton Foundation.

1960 arrangements by Igor Stravinsky of music by Carlo Gesualdo

Monumentum pro Gesualdo is a 1960 arrangement and recomposition by Igor Stravinsky of three madrigals by Carlo Gesualdo. It was composed to commemorate the 400th anniversary of Gesualdo's birth and was intended to complement Stravinsky's similar Tres Sacrae Cantiones. It was premiered on September 27, 1960, at the Venice Biennale, played by the Orchestra del Teatro la Fenice conducted by Stravinsky.[1]
It was later choreographed by the New York City Ballet (NYCB) co-founder and balletmaster George Balanchine. The premiere took place on Wednesday, November 16, 1960, at City Center of Music and Drama, New York, with scenery and lighting by David Hays (new lighting by Ronald Bates in 1974) and was conducted by Robert Irving.[citation needed]
It was first performed in conjunction with Balanchine's choreographic interpretation of Movements for Piano and Orchestra in 1963 and was regularly performed in this pairing thereafter.[2]

245,The Moor's Pavane,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moor%27s_Pavane,"The Moor's Pavane , to music by Henry Purcell , 1949","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



The Moor's Pavane is a 20-minute ballet based upon the tragedy Othello by William Shakespeare. The ballet was choreographed by José Limón in 1949 to music from Henry Purcell's Abdelazer, The Gordion Knot Untied, and the pavane from Pavane and Chaconne for Strings, arranged by Simon Sadoff.[1] This ballet is José Limón's most famous work and his influence from Doris Humphrey is evident in his choreography. It was created on the Limón Company.
There are only four dancers who appear in this rendition of Othello. These dancers represent The Moor, originally played by Limón himself, Desdemona, originally played by Betty Jones, Iago, originally played by Lucas Hoving, and Emilia, originally played by Pauline Koner. Desdemona, an innocent character and tragic victim, is betrayed by Iago who hints that she has been unfaithful. This causes Othello to murder her. These dramatic actions and events take place in the form of a pavane, which is a type of courtly dance. The stately and formal choreography provides a stark contrast to the emotional and passionate characters and the violent story.
The work premiered at the Connecticut College American Dance Festival on August 17, 1949. American Ballet Theatre was the first company outside Limon's company to include the work in its repertory. Notable interpreters of the Moor include Rudolf Nureyev and Cynthia Gregory.
Since its creation, The Moor's Pavane has been added to the repertories of many different companies, including major ballet companies, showing the fading divisive line between modern dance and ballet.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Mother Goose is a ballet made for New York City Ballet's Ravel Festival by balletmaster Jerome Robbins to Ravel's music and scenario, the Ma Mère l'Oye Suite from 1908, orchestrated by the composer in 1912. The premiere took place on May 22, 1975, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center, with costumes by Stanley Simmons and lighting by Jennifer Tipton. At its premiere it bore the French title, which was retained when it was first revived in January 1978 but anglicized by May of that year.[1][2][3]
Ma Mère l'Oye was written as a suite of five pieces for piano four hands and later orchestrated and adapted into a ballet, by M. Ravel, with the addition of a prelude, an opening scene and four interludes connecting the five original pieces.

Ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins


MovesChoreographerJerome RobbinsPremiereJuly 3, 1959 (1959-07-03)Spoleto, ItalyOriginal ballet companyBallets: USAGenreneoclassical ballet
Moves[a] is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins. The ballet was made for Robbins's troupe Ballet: USA's 1959 tour, with Aaron Copland brought in to write the music. However, he struggled with the score, and Robbins ultimately decided to have the ballet performed in silence instead. The ballet premiered at the Festival of Two Worlds held in Spoleto, Italy, on July 3, 1959. It has since been revived by other dance companies, including the New York City Ballet. Copland's score was later published as Dance Panels.

Moves is performed in silence, with the dancers in practice clothes, and without scenery.[3]: 282 [4] It is an ensemble piece.[2] Robbins wrote that without music, sets and costumes, the ballet ""places the dancer's body under a magnifying glass. The relationships on stage are different in silence. Nothing is holding the dance or the emotion but the movements and their relationships to each other.""[5]: 308  The choreography contains sight cues and small audible cues to allow the dancers to know the tempo.[3]

Production[edit]
In 1959, Robbins's company Ballet: USA was set to tour sixteen countries under the auspices of the State Department.[6] Having previously used Aaron Copland's Clarinet Concerto for his The Pied Piper and staged Copland's opera The Tender Land, Robbins had wanted to work with the composer again. Though the former intended to choreograph a large-scale ballet to The Red Pony for New York City Ballet's tenth anniversary season, the project was abandoned because of Robbins's works in musical theater, and Ballet: USA did not have the resource to do so.[6][7]

When Copland offered to write a score for Robbins, the latter was ""very inwardly excited"" and ""so honored"". He accepted the offer immediately, and provided his idea, ""a non-story ballet tentatively entitled Theatre Waltzes or something like that,""[6] that wouldrepresent ... the style, youth, technical competence, theatrical qualities and personalities of the company in pure dance terms. The technique is essentially classic ballet (in the way that Americans employ it) and to make the whole ballet a decorative statement – open, positive, inventive, joyous (rather than introspective) – a parade; a presentation; perhaps elegant, witty, tender and with a sure technique.[6] Robbins also gave a list of twenty-two potential movements. However, he noted, ""These are only ideas – and all can be thrown out if anything suggests something else – Feel Free.""[5]: 306 
Copland struggled with fulfilling Robbins's ideas. When rehearsals were about to start, he had just begun, but was able to play what was done on the piano to Robbins.[6] The choreographer then started working on the ballet. Some of the dancers noted Robbins using the 34 time signature and had the pianist play Copland's score in the beginning, but days later decided to rehearse in silence.[5]: 306  Robbins recalled, A strange thing happened. I went straight to rehearsal without the music right after Aaron played the score for me. I tried to remember it, but could only recall the counts. When I began working with the company just with counts, I got interested with what they were doing without music. It fascinated me, and I continued working that way. It really moved along.[7]

In early June, just before the company was scheduled to leave for the tour, Copland provided a sketch of the score, with a note stating, ""I couldn't stop to get help with playing [it], so have sent you a mere outline of the piece, will do another version for you later.""[6] Robbins realized his choreography and Copland's score were very different. The score was ""great ... and full of such truly sensitive music that there is insufficient time for me to have a full and urgent grasp of its wonderful material."" Robbins therefore decided to have the ballet performed in silence and named it Moves.[6]
American National Theater and Academy (ANTA), the sponsor of the ballet, and the State Department panel were outraged and attempted to get Robbins abandon Moves.[5]: 306–307 [6] A run-through was held before the company left for the tour. Though Robbins thought it needed some cutting, it was well-received, including by Copland, but was despised by the panel.[5]: 307  The panel attempted to get Moves replaced with Interplay. Robbins had also considered this but rejected this idea because Interplay is too similar to N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz, which would also be performed on tour.[5]: 307 
Copland's score was later published as Dance Panels. In a later interview, Robbins said, ""I was sorry I wasn't able to do Dance Panels, but in a very real way Aaron's music was the accidental genesis of my ballet without music, Moves.""[7]

In 1966, Robbins staged Moves for the Batsheva Dance Company in Israel.[5]: 388–389  The following year, it was added to Joffrey Ballet's repertory.[4] In 1984, Robbins's company, the New York City Ballet, debuted Moves.[1] In 1993, Robbins remounted the ballet for the Paris Opera Ballet.[3]: 513–514

Ballet by George Balanchine


Movements for Piano and OrchestraChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicIgor StravinskyPremiereApril 9, 1963 (1963-04-09)City Center of Music and DramaOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletGenreneoclassical ballet
Movements for Piano and Orchestra is a neoclassical ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Stravinsky's score of the same name. The ballet premiered on April 9, 1963, at City Center of Music and Drama, performed by the New York City Ballet. Though the two lead roles were created for Diana Adams and Jacques d'Amboise, seventeen-year-old Suzanne Farrell danced the female lead at the premiere due to Adams' pregnancy. Starting in 1966, Movements and Monumentum pro Gesualdo (1960) are performed together.


Choreography[edit]
Movements for Piano and Orchestra is set to the composition of the same name by Stravinsky, a friend of Balanchine.[1][2] Balanchine commented that the score's ""complexity and compression are remarkable.""[3] However, conductor Hugo Fiorato once said, ""Who ... would listen to Movements of Stravinsky by itself? ... I don't think I would. But when you hear Movements and you see Movements through Balanchine's eyes and what he has added to the score, it suddenly becomes an amazingly exciting work.""[4]
Movements is performed by a lead couple and a corps de ballet consisting of six women.[5] New York Times critic Allen Hughes noted the two leads ""are generally engaged in the kind of Balanchine duets that explores the variety of poses for two. It is, in fact, as if Balanchine had examined all the statuary in the world and has summed up all the pose possibilities in this work. Yet the result is not static.""[5] Author Richard Buckle noted the corps ""alone moves during the terse intermediate sections connecting the five movements and which backs up the principals in the remainder of the ballet."" They are often divided to two trios, and ""assume an extraordinary variety of poses, like eccentric modern versions of the Three Graces.""[4]

Responding to Balanchine's choreography, Stravinsky wrote:To see Balanchine's choreography of Movements is to hear the music with one's eyes, and this visual hearing has been a greater revelation to me, I think, than to anyone else. The choreography emphasizes relationships of which I had hardly been aware – in the same way – and the performance was like a tour of a building for which I had drawn the plans but never explored the result. Balanchine approached the music by identifying some of the more familiar marks of my style, and as I heard him fastening on my tiniest repeated rhythm or sustaining group, I knew he had joined the work to the corpus of my music, at the same time probably reducing the time lag of its general acceptability by as much as a decade. I owe him even more for another aspect of the revelation: his dramatic point is a love parable – in which ballet is it not? – but the coda had a suggestion of myth that reminded me of the ending of Apollo.[6]: 258–259 
Production[edit]
Balanchine conceived the idea of Movements for Piano and Orchestra for Diana Adams, one of his muses at the time, and Jacques d'Amboise as the two leads. In his memoir, d'Amboise wrote that Balanchine ""didn't want to be bothered with anyone else"" whenever he created a new piece for one of his muses, but ballet master John Taras wanted Balanchine to have an understudy for Adams, and suggested 17-year-old Suzanne Farrell.[1][4] Farrell was discovered by Adams during an audition tour for the School of American Ballet, and joined the New York City Ballet in 1961.[7]: 149–150  While Farrell attended rehearsals, she was ignored by Balanchine.[1] However, in Farrell's account, Adams ""had no official understudy.""[2] Stravinsky attended some rehearsals, and he later wrote that when Balanchine requested the dancers to repeat some steps without the music, ""To my amazement they were able to count it by themselves, which is rather better than many orchestras. But are the Movements ballet music? Barbarous locution to a Balanchine! What he needs from me is not a pas de deux but a motor impulse.""[6]: 259 
Two weeks before the premiere, Adams found out she was pregnant. She was ordered by the doctor to be on bed rest, having previously suffered from multiple miscarriages.[1][2] The news infuriated Balanchine, and he considered having the premiere cancelled.[1] After Taras protested, Balanchine replied, ""If you want to do it, do it.""[4] According to Farrell's memoir, d'Amboise knew Farrell was a quick learner, and lobbied Balanchine to replace Adams with Farrell. Balanchine initially opposed the idea, but later reluctantly agreed.[2] Less than a week before Movements premiered, d'Amboise brought Farrell to Adams' apartment, where Adams taught Farrell the ballet while lying on the couch.[1][2] Farrell had never heard the music before, and in that rehearsal, Adams and d'Amboise hummed the music. However, Farrell managed to learn the choreography in two hours.[2] The next day, Farrell, d'Amboise and pianist Gordon Boelzner rehearsed together. That was when Farrell first heard the music.[2] Taras later was able to convince Balanchine to see Farrell in rehearsal. He was impressed by Farrell and provided corrections to both her and d'Amboise.[1] In the days leading up to the premiere, the rehearsals with the corps de ballet were led by Taras.[4] Adams never performed Movements, and eventually left the company.[7]: 120  Farrell noted she ""had no idea what was going on"" at the time, and only learned the full story years later.[2]
At the premiere, the women were dressed in white leotards. Farrell thought black leotards might be more suitable, as she believed they are ""more slimming and flattering to the body,"" and Balanchine approved of this change. However, she ""knew it was all wrong"" once she saw the corps de ballet on stage. The women's costumes were soon reverted to white leotards.[2] The sole man in the ballet wears a white shirt and black tights.[5]

Performances[edit]
Movements for Piano and Orchestra premiered on April 9, 1963, at City Center of Music and Drama, with Robert Irving conducting and the piano played by Gordon Boelzner.[6]: 412 [5]
Starting in 1966, Movements and Monumentum pro Gesualdo (1960) are performed together.[4] Balanchine explained, ""Both have music by Stravinsky, both are short works, and it has been convenient for our audiences, and for us in the New York City Ballet, to see them combined.""[3]
According to Farrell, First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy invited the company to perform Movements at the White House. While Balanchine was ""pleased"", he rejected the request as the orchestra would not be able to perform.[2] Farrell's company, the Suzanne Farrell Ballet, had revived Movements.[8]

Videography[edit]
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the New York City Ballet released a 2015 video recording of Movements online, featuring Maria Kowroski and Ask la Cour.[9]

Ballet choreographed by George Balanchine


MozartianaChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicPyotr Ilyich TchaikovskyPremiereJune 4, 1981 (1981-06-04)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignRouben Ter-Arutunian
Mozartiana is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Tchaikovsky's Orchestral Suite No. 4, Mozartiana. The current version of the ballet was made for New York City Ballet's Tchaikovsky Festival, and premiered on June 4, 1981, at the New York State Theater. It is considered Balanchine's last major work.
Balanchine had previously choreographed to the same score in 1933, for his short-lived troupe Les Ballets 1933 in Paris, his first major ballet to music by Tchaikovsky. It had its American premiere the following year, and Balanchine made some changes to the choreography in 1935. This earlier version was performed by several troupes until 1956. This version's choreography and designs are completely different from the 1981 version.


Previous versions[edit]
In 1933, George Balanchine and librettist Boris Kochno co-founded Les Ballets 1933, after being dismissed from the Original Ballet Russe. The company was mainly funded by Edward James, and also backed by friends such as composer Cole Porter and fashion designer Coco Chanel.[1] One of the ballets Balanchine choreographed for the company was Mozartiana, to Tchaikovsky's Orchestral Suite No. 4, Mozartiana,[1] which was written as a tribute to Mozart.[2]: 252  It was the first time Balanchine created a major ballet to music by Tchaikovsky.[3] The costumes and set were designed by Christian Bérard.[1] The ballet premiered on June 7, 1933, at Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, Paris,[4]: 412  at Les Ballets 1933's first-ever performance.[1] It starred a fourteen-year-old Tamara Toumanova and Roman Jasinski.[3] The company disbanded after four weeks of performances in Paris and London between June and July.[1]
In 1934, Balanchine co-founded the School of American Ballet in New York. To allow the students to learn his style, Balanchine had the students learn the works he made for Les Ballets 1933, including Mozartiana.[5]: 88  In June 1934, the students performed the ballet at the school co-founder Edward Warburg's estate in White Plains, New York, despite Balanchine's reluctance to let the inexperienced students to dance in front of an audience.[5]: 88–89 [6] Among the students in Mozartiana were Marie-Jeanne. Some of the girls had to perform roles that were meant for men.[6] The students performed the ballet again in December that year, this time at Avery Memorial Theatre, Hartford, Connecticut, at the invitation of Arthur Everett Austin Jr.[6]
In 1935, Balanchine's American Ballet revived Mozartiana, with parts of the choreography revised.[1] It was performed at the company's cross-country tour, starting at Westchester County Center in White Plains, New York. However, the tour was canceled after two weeks.[6] It was performed at least once at the Metropolitan Opera House the following year.[6] In 1945, Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo revived Mozartiana, with a cast led by Alexandra Danilova and Frederic Franklin.[5][7] In 1956, Danilova's troupe performed Mozartiana. This was the last revival of the original Mozartiana, making it the longest-lived ballet in the Les Ballet 1933 repertory.[1]

Production[edit]
In 1981, Balanchine, who had made thirty-seven ballets to music by Tchaikovsky, decided that the New York City Ballet would hold an eleven day-long Tchaikovsky Festival to pay tribute to the composer.[2]: 251  For the festival, he decided to rechoreograph Mozartiana.[5]: 307 
Balanchine chose Suzanne Farrell to dance the female lead role. According to Farrell's memoir, she thought it was possible that Mozartiana would be the last time the two work together due to Balanchine's poor health.[2]: 251  He asked her who did she want to dance the ballet with, and she suggested Peter Martins, her frequent partner. However, Balanchine suggested Ib Andersen, a new member of the company whom Farrell had never danced with.[2]: 252  Despite her initial reservations, Farrell soon realized that Andersen fitted the vision Balanchine had for the ballet.[2]: 252  Balanchine was so impressed by Andersen's subtleness and musicality that he once exclaimed ""Ib is Mozart.""[5]: 308  Victor Castelli was chosen as another soloist in the ballet. Four students at the School of American Ballet, Dara Adler, Lisa Cantor, Amy Fixler and Tamara Aguirre Molina, were all cast in the ballet.[8][9]
Rehearsals for the new Mozartiana began in May, three weeks before the ballet premiere, while the company's performance season was ongoing, all other ballet masters were busy working on other ballets, and Balanchine himself was staging other works.[5]: 307–308 [8] Balanchine changed the sequence of the music, with Preghiera moved to the beginning of the ballet, so Farrell could dance in both Preghiera and the Theme and Variations.[5]: 307  It took one to three hours for Balanchine to work on each sections of the ballet, with few changes made afterwards.[8] Preghiera was the last section Balanchine worked on,[2]: 255  and was choreographed between the matinee and evening performances in one day.[8] Balanchine however was unable to decided how the Theme and Variations should end until the day of the premiere.[8] During one of the last rehearsals for the ballet, Castelli injured himself, and was replaced with Christopher d'Amboise, a new member of the company and son of principal dancer Jacques d'Amboise.[5]: 308  Both Farrell and former members of Ballet Russe noted the 1981 Mozartiana is completely different to the previous versions.[7][8]
The costumes were designed by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, replacing the Christian Bérard designs for the 1933 version.[8] Farrell recalled that Ter-Arutunian and Balanchine went through multiple versions of the costumes for her. The final product, a knee-length black tutu, was completed on the day of the dress rehearsal and the day before the premiere.[2]: 253  Previously, Farrell was usually dressed in white in Balanchine ballets.[5]: 307 
Robert Maiorano, a former soloist at the company who went on to become a writer, was allowed to observe the development process for Mozartiana.[5]: 307  He and Valerie Brooks then co-authored the book Balanchine's Mozartiana: The Making of a Masterpiece, published in 1985.[10]
Mozartiana was made after Balanchine signed his will. As one of the ballets not specified in his will, the rights to the ballet went to dancer Karin von Aroldingen and his secretary Barbara Horgan, both of whom inherited many of his works, following his death in 1983.[4]: 401 

Choreography[edit]
Mozartiana is danced by a principal ballerina, two men, a corps de ballet of four tall women, and four young girls.[8][11] Farrell noted the ballet is challenging for the dancers' stamina, and added, ""Mozartiana is a ballet that is big for the eyes and ears, but is danced by a small cast. Though it is contained, it's all over the place. There are some very hard, different things in it. Having a good class beforehand isn't going to make you dance this ballet better. And there's nothing in it that you can relate to other ballets you've done, for security.""[2]
The first section of the ballet is Preghiera, or Prayer, is performed by the principal ballerina and the four children.[8] Farrell commented, ""Technically, this dance was short and simple, but it required a state of mind beyond anything I had ever attempted before. It was a hymn shared by [Balanchine] and me, an offering that could happen only in movement and music, not in words.[2]: 255  Balanchine's biographer Bernard Taper noted that in this section accented the theme of memento mori.[4]: 377 
Gigue is a male solo.[11] Castelli, whom the role was made for, commented, ""The steps were mostly short and had to be very sharp and down into the floor. Certain of the rhythms seemed to go almost opposite to what the music was saying and put you off going into the next step. But once you got them in your body you suddenly realized that was the only way it could be done.""[8] It is followed by Minuet, danced by the corps of four women.[8]
Theme and Variations is performed by the principal couple. Unlike traditional pas de deux, it begins with several solos for each of the dancers, and ends with a duet, which Farrell described, ""Even here the dancing was not at all the usual male/female partnering. Ib and I often danced separately in a kind of dialogue with each other. If most pas de deux indicate a kind of love story, this one did not. We didn't seem to be man and woman, but people with some kind of greater independence and purpose.""[2]: 253 
The finale features the entire cast, and was described as ""joyous, full-blossoming"" by critic Jennifer Dunning.[12]

Performances[edit]
Mozartiana premiered on June 4, 1981, at the New York State Theater,[4]: 439  during the first night of the Tchaikovsky Festival[9] During the premiere, Farrell broke a small bone on her right foot, though she managed to complete the performance. While Mozartiana was scheduled to perform several more times during the festival, they were all canceled as there were no understudies.[2]: 252  Castelli took over the role he was supposed to dance the year after its premiere.[13]
In 1982, the first performance of Mozartiana outside of the New York City Ballet was held at Chicago City Ballet, where Farrell's then-husband, Paul Mejia, served as co-artistic director. Farrell and Andersen reprised their roles as guest artists. However, it was only performed once as Andersen had to undergo an emergency appendectomy the next day.[2]: 262  According to Farrell, in 1984, Rudolf Nureyev had expressed interest in dancing Mozartiana but was unable to do so ""for several reasons.""[2]: 276 
Mozartiana had since been revived by Farrell's company, the Suzanne Farrell Ballet.[14] Other troupes that had performed the ballet include the Paris Opera Ballet,[15] American Ballet Theatre,[16] National Ballet of Canada,[17] Birmingham Royal Ballet,[18] Pacific Northwest Ballet and Kansas City Ballet.[19][20]
In 2005, after Castelli's death, the New York City Ballet dedicated a performance of Mozartiana to him.[13]

Critical reception[edit]
Following the premiere, New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff commented that ""Mozartiana is a subtle work, deliberately simple-looking, from a choreographer who can create the most complex ballets in the world."" However, she noted that the ballet was underrehearsed.[9] Later that year, she reviewed the ballet again, now ""performed properly"", and wrote, ""For all its seriousness as a work of art, Mozartiana is also a work of gaiety. Here is a ballet as sublime as the not-so unrelated Balanchine-Mozart Divertimento No. 15. It has a similar pristinely crystalline quality. But it also has a new wit and epigrammatic tone that manifest themselves in several ways.""[11]
Mozartiana is considered Balanchine's last major work.[3]

Napoli, or The Fisherman and His Bride is a ballet created in 1842 for Denmark's Royal Ballet by Danish choreographer and ballet master August Bournonville. It tells the story of Teresina, a young Italian girl who falls in love with Gennaro, a fisherman, and culminates in the marriage of the lovers.


Synopsis[edit]
Act I (The Market). Teresina's mother, Veronica, who does not want her to marry poor Gennaro, introduces her to two other suitors. These are two older but rich men named Peppo and Giacomo. Teresina, much to her mother's distress, refuses them both and instead goes off to wait for Gennaro. When Gennaro arrives back at port, he and Teresina go to find Veronica and try to convince her that they should wed. Luckily for them, this task proves relatively easy once she sees how true the young couple's love is. Full of happiness Teresina and Gennaro sail off together.
Meanwhile, a group of entertainers come and put on a show for the townsfolk. However, a violent storm begins and the festivities come to an abrupt end. When the storm ends, Gennaro is found, but Teresina is not. Thinking she has drowned, Veronica openly mourns for her daughter and blames Gennaro for her death. So stricken by this turn of events Gennaro becomes so agitated that he almost commits suicide, but stops when he sees a statue of the Madonna. Soon Fra Ambrosio, the local monk, appears and gives him a picture of the Madonna telling him to go and find Teresina.
Act II (The Blue Grotto). Gennaro looks everywhere for Teresina and eventually finds her in the Blue Grotto, a magical place ruled by Golfo who has turned Teresina into a naiad (Fairy of the Sea). Because of the transformation, Teresina no longer remembers Gennaro. However, through faith, Teresina is changed back into a human and has her memory restored. Quickly, Gennaro and Teresina leave the Grotto to return to Naples.
Act III (The Wedding). When Teresina and Gennaro return the townsfolk are suspicious because they had thought Teresina was dead. Peppo and Giacomo even try to convince everyone that Gennaro is in league with the devil. This rumor is soon disproved and the wedding reception begins.

Characters[edit]
Teresina, a young Italian girl in love with Gennaro
Gennaro, a young Italian fisherman in love with Teresina
Veronica, Teresina's mother
Peppo, a wealthy, old, lemonade seller who loves Teresina
Giacomo, an older, but rich, macaroni seller who loves Teresina
Fra' Ambrosio, a monk
Golfo, the sea demon ruling the blue grotto
Music[edit]
Several composers contributed to the score: Edvard Helsted and Holger Simon Paulli composed Acts I and III; Niels W. Gade created the blue grotto atmosphere for Act II, including a popular melody of the time, La Melancholie, composed by the violin virtuoso François Prume. Bournonville asked Hans Christian Lumbye, later to become the famous Tivoli Gardens composer, to provide the music for the concluding galop that follows Paulli's tarantella.
Bournonville recounts in his memoirs how, during a monotonous carriage journey, he spent hours humming what became the first three sections of the tarantella in Act III. The tarantella became the inspiration for the creation of the ballet.
In Act I, Rossini's slander aria from The Barber of Seville is used as the basis for Peppo's slander scene; the folk tune Te voglio ben assai is used in Act I to highlight the young lovers' feelings; the Latin hymn ""O Santissima"" is used in Act II to underscore the power of Christianity over Golfo's demonry.

Genesis and criticism[edit]
The ballet was choreographed after Bournonville had visited Naples (it: Napoli), where he had been impressed by the local colour and the vibrancy of a city in constant movement.[1] He strove to include the ""brightness and dynamism"" of the city in the work, ending the final act with a lively tarantella.
The ballet has been criticised for its lengthy pantomime in the first and second acts. The dancing really comes to forefront only in the third act.[1] As the music is not the caliber of a Tchaikovsky or Glazunov, this can be a challenge.[2] However, the piece has also been praised for its ""local colour,"" the exceptional male solos, and is sometimes referred to as Bournonville's ""signature work.""[3])

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Night and Day (La Nuit et le Jour or The Night and the Day) is a fantastic ballet in 1 act/3 scenes, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Ludwig Minkus.[1]
This ballet was produced for the festivities held at the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre in honor of the coronation of Tsar Alexander III and Empress Maria Feodorovna, who were crowned at the Uspensky Cathedral of the Moscow Kremlin three days prior to the ballet's premiere. The Tsar was so impressed by the work (being an avid balletomane) that he ordered the work be performed a second time two days later for a performance attended only by his immediate family. A March from the work was among the Tsar's favorite pieces, and he often requested that his orchestra play it during Imperial Balls and other social events for the St. Petersburg royalty and nobility.[2]
The ballet was premièred on May 18/30 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1883, at the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre by the Imperial Ballet.

Synopsis[edit]
A pastoral landscape, the edge of a forest bordering a lake. The moon shines through the leaves. The Spirits of the Day are shackled near the sanctuary where the sacred fire of the sun is burning.
All nature is peaceful. The Night Star announces the arrival of her sovereign. The other stars are persuaded to descend from the heavens and to take part in the Festival of Darkness. A group of naiads and nereids rise up from the depth of the lake, while dryads emerge from the trunks of the ancient oaks. All dance in the moonlight. They are joined by wilis, delicate offspring of the clouds, and swans transformed into women who dance around, while ferns clasp them in their feathery arms. The Queen of the Night appears in the midst of this fantastic assembly. She joins in the merrymaking, but always watches for the Spirits of the Day since their appearance will mark the end of her reign.
The moon sinks behind the mountains as the last hour of the night passes by and the horizon is illuminated by the first rays of the new dawn. The Morning Star breaks the chains of the captive spirits of the sun so that they can engage in the eternal conflict with the Deities of Darkness. A fierce battle rages, but Time appears and brings the conflict to an end. Night must inevitably give way to Day. The dawn colours the sky red and finally, disperses the Spirits of Darkness. The way is now open for the Sun, which floods the landscape with golden rays.
The Queen of the Day with her companions greets the Star of Light. All nature comes alive; as the trees stir, leaves unfold at the touch of the rays, flowers rise on their erect stalks and open. Colourful birds dart about, while insects and butterflies perform a song of peace and love in the golden light. A swarm of bees appears and collect their offerings from the flowers. A distant song is heard. Representatives from the different provinces of Russia arrive to celebrate the Festival of Light. The Spirits of the Day vanish and the birds and insects fly off.
The hillsides are covered with people and the lake is covered in boats. The nations of the Empire are united in giving homage to the Star of the Day, which shines in splendour and radiates happiness and abundance. All the provinces are represented. Dancing begins and at the climax, the Spirit of Russia appears, carried by an eagle and floating over all the people and glory of Russia. Bright colours forming an aureole are dispersed to reveal a great panorama of the cities of Russia.[5]

Nine Sinatra Songs is a ballet choreographed by Twyla Tharp to songs sung by Frank Sinatra. The ballet is danced by seven couples, portraying different stages of romantic relationships, with ballroom dancing incorporated into the choreography. The ballet was made for Twyla Tharp Dance, and premiered on October 14, 1982, at Queen Elizabeth Theatre, Vancouver, Canada.


Development[edit]
Nine Sinatra Songs is Tharp's second foray into choreographing to Sinatra's songs. Her first attempt was One More Frank (1976), made for an American Ballet Theatre gala, danced by her and Mikhail Baryshnikov. The work was booed by the audience as it did not contain any virtuosic steps expected from Baryshnikov.[1][2]
Tharp made Nine Sinatra Songs for the Twyla Tharp Dance.[1] The ballet, danced by seven couples, depicts different stages of romantic relationships.[3] After researching ballroom dancing, particularly the couple Vernon and Irene Castle, for the 1981 film Ragtime, Tharp decided to incorporate ballroom dancing into the choreography of Nine Sinatra Songs, with the women dancing in heels.[1] Tharp had planned to dance in the ballet, but her role was ultimately danced by Sara Rudner.[4]
Tharp chose songs from the 1950s and 1960s, a time ""when my parents were together, when all parents were together, the last time we assumed as a culture that of course men and women lived together and loved for a lifetime, a condition I was still craving but begin to see as against all odds.""[1][4] Despite the title, the ballet only contains eight songs, with a reprise for ""My Way"".[5] The reprise, however, uses a recording a later live performance at the Madison Square Garden. Tharp found that in this recording, ""Sinatra's voice is much more mature, his passion deeper and stronger, his commitment absolutely secure.""[4]
Oscar de la Renta designed the costume, with women in 1950s style gowns and men in tuxedos. The lighting was designed by Jennifer Tipton.[1][4]

Performances[edit]
Nine Sinatra Songs premiered on October 14, 1982, at Queen Elizabeth Theatre, Vancouver.[3]
Other ballet companies that had performed the ballet include American Ballet Theatre,[6] Pacific Northwest Ballet,[3] Washington Ballet,[7] Ballet West,[8] Hubbard Street Dance Chicago and Birmingham Royal Ballet.[5][9]
In 1983, Tharp revised material from the ballet to make Sinatra Suite for American Ballet Theatre, with Baryshnikov and Elaine Kudo dancing. This ballet features songs ""Strangers in the Night"", ""All the Way"", ""That's Life"" and ""My Way"", while ""One For My Baby (and One More For the Road)"" was rechoreographed to a male solo.[1][10] In 2010, Tharp incorporated songs used in Nine Sinatra Songs into her dance revue Come Fly Away, with three numbers intact.[1][11]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet by Paul Hindemith
Nobilissima visione (The Noblest Vision) is a 50-minute ballet (or, more precisely, a ""dance legend"") in six scenes by Paul Hindemith, originally choreographed by Léonide Massine for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. The libretto by Hindemith and Massine depicts episodes from the life of Saint Francis of Assisi. The work was completed in February 1938 and premiered at Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London on 21 July 1938, with sets and costumes by Pavel Tchelitchew and under the baton of the composer. He led one performance of the new ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York (for which the title was temporarily altered to Saint Francis) on 14 October of the same year.[1]
After the ballet premiere, Hindemith extracted a 20-minute orchestral suite (retaining the Nobilissima visione name) in three movements, using five of the original eleven movements:

Introduction and Rondo
March and Pastorale
Passacaglia
The first performance of the suite in Venice was at Teatro La Fenice on 13 September 1938 and has become a regularly programmed orchestral work. Though the ballet was originally scored for a small orchestra, the suite was for a full symphony orchestra from the outset. The suite does not attempt to follow the action of the ballet, instead Hindemith extracted only those portions of the score which he felt would be most effective in the concert hall.  Hindemith himself conducted the Philharmonia Orchestra in a 21 November 1956 stereophonic recording of the suite, which was released by EMI.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Notre-Dame de Paris is a ballet by French choreographer Roland Petit. It was premiered by the Paris Opera Ballet in 1967. The ballet is based on Victor Hugo's 1831 novel The Hunchback of Notre Dame.
It was the first work Petit created for the Paris Opera Ballet, which he had left 20 years earlier.[1]
This ballet was very successful and continues to be performed to the present, including a series of performances at the Opéra national de Paris at the end of the 2013–2014 season, at the Opera Bastille and a production in 2013 at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan.[2]

List of all compositionsvte
The Nutcracker (Russian: Щелкунчик[a], romanized: Shchelkunchik, pronounced [ɕːɪɫˈkunʲt͡ɕɪk] ⓘ), Op. 71, is an 1892 two-act classical ballet (conceived as a ballet-féerie; Russian: балет-феерия, romanized: balet-feyeriya) by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, set on Christmas Eve at the foot of a Christmas tree in a child's imagination. The plot is an adaptation of E. T. A. Hoffmann's 1816 short story The Nutcracker and the Mouse King. The ballet's first choreographer was Marius Petipa, with whom Tchaikovsky had worked three years earlier on The Sleeping Beauty, assisted by Lev Ivanov. Although the complete and staged The Nutcracker ballet was not as successful as had been the 20-minute Nutcracker Suite that Tchaikovsky had premiered nine months earlier, The Nutcracker soon became popular.
Since the late 1960s, it has been danced by countless ballet companies, especially in North America.[1] Major American ballet companies generate around 40% of their annual ticket revenues from performances of The Nutcracker.[2][3] The ballet's score has been used in several film adaptations of Hoffmann's story.
Tchaikovsky's score has become one of his most famous compositions. Among other things, the score is noted for its use of the celesta, an instrument the composer had already employed in his much lesser known symphonic ballad The Voyevoda (1891).


Composition[edit]
After the success of The Sleeping Beauty in 1890, Ivan Vsevolozhsky, the director of the Imperial Theatres, commissioned Tchaikovsky to compose a double-bill program featuring both an opera and a ballet. The opera would be Iolanta. For the ballet, Tchaikovsky would again join forces with Marius Petipa, with whom he had collaborated on The Sleeping Beauty. The material Vsevolozhsky chose was an adaptation of E. T. A. Hoffmann's story ""The Nutcracker and the Mouse King"", by Alexandre Dumas called ""The Story of a Nutcracker"".[4] The plot of Hoffmann's story (and Dumas' adaptation) was greatly simplified for the two-act ballet. Hoffmann's tale contains a long flashback story within its main plot titled ""The Tale of the Hard Nut"", which explains how the Prince was turned into the Nutcracker. This had to be excised for the ballet.[5]
Petipa gave Tchaikovsky extremely detailed instructions for the composition of each number, down to the tempo and number of bars.[4] The completion of the work was interrupted for a short time when Tchaikovsky visited the United States for twenty-five days to conduct concerts for the opening of Carnegie Hall.[6] Tchaikovsky composed parts of The Nutcracker in Rouen, France.[7]

History[edit]
Saint Petersburg premiere[edit]
(Left to right) Lydia Rubtsova as Marianna, Stanislava Belinskaya as Clara and Vassily Stukolkin as Fritz, in the original production of The Nutcracker (Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, Saint Petersburg, 1892)
Varvara Nikitina as the Sugar Plum Fairy and Pavel Gerdt as the Cavalier, in a later performance in the original run of The Nutcracker, 1892The first performance of the ballet was held as a double premiere together with Tchaikovsky's last opera, Iolanta, on 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1892, at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, Russia.[8] Although the libretto was by Marius Petipa, who exactly choreographed the first production has been debated. Petipa began work on the choreography in August 1892; however, illness removed him from its completion and his assistant of seven years, Lev Ivanov, was brought in. Although Ivanov is often credited as the choreographer, some contemporary accounts credit Petipa. The performance was conducted by Italian composer Riccardo Drigo, with Antonietta Dell'Era as the Sugar Plum Fairy, Pavel Gerdt as Prince Coqueluche, Stanislava Belinskaya as Clara, Sergei Legat as the Nutcracker-Prince, and Timofey Stukolkin as Drosselmeyer. Unlike in many later productions, the children's roles were performed by real children – students of the Imperial Ballet School in Saint Petersburg, with Belinskaya as Clara, and Vassily Stukolkin as Fritz – rather than adults.
The first performance of The Nutcracker was not deemed a success.[9] The reaction to the dancers themselves was ambivalent. Although some critics praised Dell'Era on her pointework as the Sugar Plum Fairy (she allegedly received five curtain-calls), one critic called her ""corpulent"" and ""podgy"". Olga Preobrajenskaya as the Columbine doll was panned by one critic as ""completely insipid"" and praised as ""charming"" by another.[10]
Alexandre Benois described the choreography of the battle scene as confusing: ""One can not understand anything. Disorderly pushing about from corner to corner and running backwards and forwards – quite amateurish.""[10]
The libretto was criticized as ""lopsided""[11] and for not being faithful to the Hoffmann tale. Much of the criticism focused on the featuring of children so prominently in the ballet,[12] and many bemoaned the fact that the ballerina did not dance until the Grand Pas de Deux near the end of the second act (which did not occur until nearly midnight during the program).[11] Some found the transition between the mundane world of the first scene and the fantasy world of the second act too abrupt.[4] Reception was better for Tchaikovsky's score. Some critics called it ""astonishingly rich in detailed inspiration"" and ""from beginning to end, beautiful, melodious, original, and characteristic"".[13] But this also was not unanimous, as some critics found the party scene ""ponderous"" and the Grand Pas de Deux ""insipid"".[14]

Subsequent productions[edit]
For a more comprehensive list, see List of productions of The Nutcracker.
Olga Preobrajenska as the Sugar Plum Fairy and Nikolai Legat as Prince Coqueluche in the Grand pas de deux in the original production of The Nutcracker. Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, Saint Petersburg, c. 1900In 1919, choreographer Alexander Gorsky staged a production which eliminated the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier and gave their dances to Clara and the Nutcracker Prince, who were played by adults instead of children. This was the first production to do so. An abridged version of the ballet was first performed outside Russia in Budapest (Royal Opera House) in 1927, with choreography by Ede Brada.[15][unreliable source?] In 1934, choreographer Vasili Vainonen staged a version of the work that addressed many of the criticisms of the original 1892 production by casting adult dancers in the roles of Clara and the Prince, as Gorsky had. The Vainonen version influenced several later productions.[4]
The first complete performance outside Russia took place in England in 1934,[9] staged by Nicholas Sergeyev after Petipa's original choreography. Annual performances of the ballet have been staged there since 1952.[16] Another abridged version of the ballet, performed by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, was staged in New York City in 1940,[17] Alexandra Fedorova – again, after Petipa's version.[9] The ballet's first complete United States performance was on 24 December 1944 by the San Francisco Ballet, staged by its artistic director, Willam Christensen, and starring Gisella Caccialanza as the Sugar Plum Fairy, and Jocelyn Vollmar as the Snow Queen.[18][9] After the enormous success of this production, San Francisco Ballet has presented Nutcracker every Christmas Eve and throughout the winter season, debuting new productions in 1944, 1954, 1967, and 2004. The original Christensen version continues in Salt Lake City, where Christensen relocated in 1948. It has been performed every year since 1963 by the Christensen-founded Ballet West.[19]
The New York City Ballet gave its first annual performance of George Balanchine's reworked staging of The Nutcracker in 1954.[9] The performance of Maria Tallchief in the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy helped elevate the work from obscurity into an annual Christmas classic and the industry's most reliable box-office draw. Critic Walter Terry remarked that ""Maria Tallchief, as the Sugar Plum Fairy, is herself a creature of magic, dancing the seemingly impossible with effortless beauty of movement, electrifying us with her brilliance, enchanting us with her radiance of being. Does she have any equals anywhere, inside or outside of fairyland? While watching her in The Nutcracker, one is tempted to doubt it.""[20]
Since Gorsky, Vainonen and Balanchine's productions, many other choreographers have made their own versions. Some institute the changes made by Gorsky and Vainonen while others, like Balanchine, utilize the original libretto. Some notable productions include Rudolf Nureyev's 1963 production for the Royal Ballet, Yury Grigorovich for the Bolshoi Ballet, Mikhail Baryshnikov for the American Ballet Theatre, Fernand Nault for Les Grands Ballets Canadiens starting in 1964, Kent Stowell for Pacific Northwest Ballet starting in 1983, and Peter Wright for the Royal Ballet and the Birmingham Royal Ballet. In recent years, revisionist productions, including those by Mark Morris, Matthew Bourne, and Mikhail Chemiakin have appeared; these depart radically from both the original 1892 libretto and Vainonen's revival, while Maurice Béjart's version completely discards the original plot and characters. In addition to annual live stagings of the work, many productions have also been televised or released on home video.[1]

Roles[edit]

Plot  [edit]
Below is a synopsis based on the original 1892 libretto by Marius Petipa. The story varies from production to production, though most follow the basic outline. The names of the characters also vary. In the original Hoffmann story, the young heroine is called Marie Stahlbaum and Clara (Klärchen) is her doll's name. In the adaptation by Dumas on which Petipa based his libretto, her name is Marie Silberhaus.[5] In still other productions, such as Balanchine's, Clara is Marie Stahlbaum rather than Clara Silberhaus.

Act I[edit]
Scene 1: The Stahlbaum Home

Konstantin Ivanov's original sketch for the set of The Nutcracker (1892) The ballet is set in Nuremberg, Germany on Christmas Eve, where family and friends have gathered in the parlor to decorate the Christmas tree in preparation for the party. Once the tree is finished, the children are summoned.
When the party begins,[22] presents are given out to the children. Suddenly, as the owl-topped grandfather clock strikes eight, a mysterious figure enters the room. It is Drosselmeyer— a local councilman, magician, and Clara's godfather. He is also a talented toymaker who has brought with him gifts for the children, including four lifelike dolls who dance to the delight of all.[23] He then has them put away for safekeeping.
Clara and her brother Fritz are sad to see the dolls being taken away, but Drosselmeyer has yet another toy for them: a wooden nutcracker doll, which the other children ignore. Clara immediately takes a liking to it, but Fritz accidentally breaks it. Clara is heartbroken, but Drosselmeyer fixes the nutcracker, much to everyone's relief.
During the night, after everyone else has gone to bed, Clara returns to the parlor to check on the nutcracker. As she reaches the small bed, the clock strikes midnight and she looks up to see Drosselmeyer perched atop it. Suddenly, mice begin to fill the room and the Christmas tree begins to grow to dizzying heights. The nutcracker also grows to life size. Clara finds herself in the midst of a battle between an army of gingerbread soldiers and the mice, led by their king.
The nutcracker appears to lead the gingerbread men, who are joined by tin soldiers, and by dolls who serve as doctors to carry away the wounded. As the seven-headed Mouse King advances on the still-wounded nutcracker, Clara throws her slipper at him, distracting him long enough for the nutcracker to stab him.[24]
Scene 2: A Pine Forest
The mice retreat and the nutcracker is transformed into a human prince.[25] He leads Clara through the moonlit night to a pine forest in which the snowflakes dance around them, beckoning them on to his kingdom as the first act ends.[26][27]

Act II[edit]
The Land of Sweets

Ivan Vsevolozhsky's original costume designs for Mother Gigogne and her Polichinelle children, 1892
Clara and the Prince travel to the beautiful Land of Sweets, ruled by the Sugar Plum Fairy in the Prince's place until his return. He recounts for her how he had been saved from the Mouse King by Clara and transformed back into himself.
In honor of the young heroine, a celebration of sweets from around the world is produced: chocolate from Spain, coffee from Arabia,[28][29] tea from China,[30] and candy canes from Russia[31] all dance for their amusement; Marzipan shepherdesses perform on their flutes;[32] Mother Ginger has her children, the Polichinelles, emerge from under her enormous hoop skirt to dance; a string of beautiful flowers perform a waltz.[33][34] To conclude the night, the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier perform a dance.[35][36]
A final waltz is performed by all the sweets, after which the Sugar Plum Fairy ushers Clara and the Prince down from their throne. He bows to her, she kisses Clara goodbye, and leads them to a reindeer-drawn sleigh. It takes off as they wave goodbye to all the subjects who wave back.
In the original libretto, the ballet's apotheosis ""represents a large beehive with flying bees, closely guarding their riches"".[37] Just like Swan Lake, there have been various alternative endings created in productions subsequent to the original.

Musical sources and influences[edit]
The Nutcracker is one of the composer's most popular compositions. The music belongs to the Romantic period and contains some of his most memorable melodies, several of which are frequently used in television and film. (They are often heard in TV commercials shown during the Christmas season.[38])

Tchaikovsky is said to have argued with a friend who wagered that the composer could not write a melody based on a one-octave scale in sequence. Tchaikovsky asked if it mattered whether the notes were in ascending or descending order and was assured it did not. This resulted in the Adagio from the Grand pas de deux, which, in the ballet, nearly always immediately follows the ""Waltz of the Flowers"". A story is also told that Tchaikovsky's sister Alexandra (9 January 1842 — 9 April 1891[39]) had died shortly before he began composition of the ballet and that his sister's death influenced him to compose a melancholy, descending scale melody for the adagio of the Grand Pas de Deux.[40] However, it is more naturally perceived as a dreams-come-true theme because of another celebrated scale use, the ascending one in the Barcarolle from The Seasons.[41]



Variation of the Sugar Plum Fairy

Danse de la Fée-Dragée (Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy) is the third pas de deux in Act II

Tchaikovsky was less satisfied with The Nutcracker than with The Sleeping Beauty. (In the film Fantasia, commentator Deems Taylor observes that he ""really detested"" the score.) Tchaikovsky accepted the commission from Vsevolozhsky but did not particularly want to write the ballet[42] (though he did write to a friend while composing it, ""I am daily becoming more and more attuned to my task"").[43]

Concert excerpts and arrangements[edit]
Tchaikovsky: The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a[edit]
Excerpt of concert performance of ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" and ""Trepak"" by the Russian National Orchestra conducted by Vladislav Lavrik [ru]
Tchaikovsky made a selection of eight of the numbers from the ballet before the ballet's December 1892 première, forming The Nutcracker Suite, Op. 71a, intended for concert performance. The suite was first performed, under the composer's direction, on 19 March 1892 at an assembly of the Saint Petersburg branch of the Musical Society.[46] The suite became instantly popular, with almost every number encored at its premiere,[47] while the complete ballet did not begin to achieve its great popularity until after the George Balanchine staging became a hit in New York City.[48] The suite became very popular on the concert stage, and was excerpted in Disney's Fantasia, omitting the two movements prior to the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy. The outline below represents the selection and sequence of the Nutcracker Suite made by the composer:

Miniature Overture (B-Flat Major)Characteristic Dances
March (G Major)Dance of the Sugar-Plum Fairy (E Minor) [ending altered from ballet version]Russian Dance (Trepak) (G Major)Arabian Dance (coffee) (G Minor)Chinese Dance (tea) (B-Flat Major)Dance of the Reed Flutes (Mirlitons) (D Major)Waltz of the Flowers (D Major)
Grainger: Paraphrase on Tchaikovsky's Flower Waltz, for solo piano[edit]
The Paraphrase on Tchaikovsky's Flower Waltz is a successful piano arrangement from one of the movements from The Nutcracker by the pianist and composer Percy Grainger.

Pletnev: Concert suite from The Nutcracker, for solo piano[edit]
The pianist and conductor Mikhail Pletnev adapted some of the music into a virtuosic concert suite for piano solo:

MarchDance of the Sugar Plum FairyTarantellaIntermezzo (Journey through the Snow)Russian TrepakChinese DanceAndante maestoso (Pas de Deux)
Contemporary arrangements[edit]
In 1942, Freddy Martin and his orchestra recorded The Nutcracker Suite for Dance Orchestra on a set of 4 10-inch 78-RPM records issued by RCA Victor. An arrangement of the suite that lay between dance music and jazz.[49]
In 1947, Fred Waring and His Pennsylvanians recorded ""The Nutcracker Suite"" on a two-part Decca Records 12-inch 78 RPM record with one part on each side as Decca DU 90022,[50] packaged in a picture sleeve. This version had custom lyrics written for Waring's chorus by, among others, Waring himself. The arrangements were by Harry Simeone.
In 1952, the Les Brown big band recorded a version of the Nutcracker Suite, arranged by Frank Comstock, for Coral Records.[51] Brown rerecorded the arrangement in stereo for his 1958 Capitol Records album Concert Modern.
In 1960, Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn composed jazz interpretations of pieces from Tchaikovsky's score, recorded and released on LP as The Nutcracker Suite.[52] In 1999, this suite was supplemented with additional arrangements from the score by David Berger for The Harlem Nutcracker, a production of the ballet by choreographer Donald Byrd (born 1949) set during the Harlem Renaissance.[53]
In 1960, Shorty Rogers released The Swingin' Nutcracker, featuring jazz interpretations of pieces from Tchaikovsky's score.
In 1962, American poet and humorist Ogden Nash wrote verses inspired by the ballet,[54] and these verses have sometimes been performed in concert versions of the Nutcracker Suite. It has been recorded with Peter Ustinov reciting the verses, and the music is unchanged from the original.[55]
In 1962 a novelty boogie piano arrangement of the ""Marche"", titled ""Nut Rocker"", was a No. 1 single in the UK, and No. 21 in the US. Credited to B. Bumble and the Stingers, it was produced by Kim Fowley and featured studio musicians Al Hazan (piano), Earl Palmer (drums), Tommy Tedesco (guitar) and Red Callender (bass). ""Nut Rocker"" has subsequently been covered by many others including The Shadows, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, The Ventures, Dropkick Murphys, The Brian Setzer Orchestra, and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. The Ventures' own instrumental rock cover of ""Nut Rocker"", known as ""Nutty"", is commonly connected to the NHL team, the Boston Bruins, from being used as the theme for the Bruins' telecast games for over two decades, from the late 1960s. In 2004, The Invincible Czars arranged, recorded, and now annually perform the entire suite for rock band.
The Trans-Siberian Orchestra's first album, Christmas Eve and Other Stories, includes an instrumental piece titled ""A Mad Russian's Christmas"", which is a rock version of music from The Nutcracker.
On the other end of the scale is the comedic version by Spike Jones and his City Slickers released by RCA Victor in December 1945 as ""Spike Jones presents for the Kiddies: The Nutcracker Suite (With Apologies to Tchaikovsky)"", featuring humorous lyrics by Foster Carling and additional music by Joe ""Country"" Washburne. An abridged and resequenced version of this recording was issued in 1971 on the LP album Spike Jones is Murdering the Classics, one of the rare comedic pop records to be issued on the prestigious RCA Red Seal label.
International choreographer Val Caniparoli has created several versions of The Nutcracker ballet for Louisville Ballet, Cincinnati Ballet, Royal New Zealand Ballet, and Grand Rapids Ballet.[56] While his ballets remain classically rooted, he has contemporarized them with changes such as making Marie an adult instead of a child, or having Drosselmeir emerges through the clock face during the overture making ""him more humorous and mischievous.""[57] Caniparoli has been influenced by his simultaneous career as a dancer, having joined San Francisco Ballet in 1971 and performing as Drosselmeir and other various Nutcracker roles ever since that time.[58]
The Disco Biscuits, a trance-fusion jam band from Philadelphia, have performed ""Waltz of the Flowers"" and ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" on multiple occasions.
The Los Angeles Guitar Quartet (LAGQ) recorded the Suite arranged for four acoustic guitars on their CD recording Dances from Renaissance to Nutcracker (1992, Delos).
In 1993, guitarist Tim Sparks recorded his arrangements for acoustic guitar on The Nutcracker Suite.
The Shirim Klezmer Orchestra released a klezmer version, titled ""Klezmer Nutcracker"", in 1998 on the Newport label. The album became the basis for a December 2008 production by Ellen Kushner, titled The Klezmer Nutcracker and staged off-Broadway in New York City.[59]
In 2002, The Constructus Corporation used the melody of Sugar Plum Fairy for their track ""Choose Your Own Adventure"".
In 2009, Pet Shop Boys used a melody from ""March"" for their track ""All Over the World"", taken from their album Yes.
In 2012, jazz pianist Eyran Katsenelenbogen released his renditions of Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy, Dance of the Reed Flutes, Russian Dance and Waltz of the Flowers from the Nutcracker Suite.
In 2014, Pentatonix released an a cappella arrangement of ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" on the holiday album That's Christmas to Me and received a Grammy Award on 16 February 2016 for best arrangement.
In 2016, Jennifer Thomas included an instrumental version of ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" on her album Winter Symphony.
In 2017, Lindsey Stirling released her version of ""Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" on her holiday album Warmer in the Winter.[60]
In 2018, Pentatonix released an a cappella arrangement of ""Waltz of the Flowers"" on the holiday album Christmas Is Here!.
In 2019, Madonna sampled a portion on her song ""Dark Ballet"" from her Madame X album.[61]
In 2019, Mariah Carey released a normal and an a cappella version of 'Sugar Plum Fairy' entitled the 'Sugar Plum Fairy Introlude' to open and close her 25th Deluxe Anniversary Edition of Merry Christmas.[62]
In 2020, Coone made a hardstyle cover version titled ""The Nutcracker"".[63]
Selected discography[edit]
The Nutcracker Suite, made its initial appearance on disc in 1909 in an abridged performance on the Odeon label. Historically, this 4 disc set is considered to be the first record album.[64] The recording was conducted by Herman Finck and featured the London Palace Orchestra.[65] It was not until after the modern LP record appeared in 1948 that recordings of the complete ballet began to be made. Because of the ballet's approximate ninety minute length when performed without intermission, applause, or interpolated numbers, the music requires two LPs. Most CD issues of the music take up two discs, often with fillers. An exception is the 81-minute 1998 Philips recording by Valery Gergiev that fits onto one CD because of Gergiev's somewhat brisker tempi.

In 1954, the first complete recording of the ballet was released on two LPs by Mercury Records. The cover design was by George Maas with illustrations by Dorothy Maas.[66] The music was performed by the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Antal Doráti. Doráti later re-recorded the complete ballet in stereo, with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1962 for Mercury and with the Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra in 1975 for Philips Classics. According to Mercury Records, the 1962 recording was made on 35mm magnetic film rather than audio tape, and used album cover art identical to that of the 1954 recording.[67][68] Dorati is the only conductor so far to have made three different recordings of the complete ballet. Some critics have cited the 1975 recording as the finest ever made of the complete ballet.[69] It is also faithful to the score in employing a boys' choir in the Waltz of the Snowflakes. Many other recordings use an adult or mixed choir.
In 1956, Artur Rodziński and the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra made a complete recording of the ballet in stereo for Westminster Records.
In 1959, the first stereo LP album set of the complete ballet, with Ernest Ansermet conducting t"

1944 production of the Nutcracker

Tchaikovsky's now-classic 1892 ballet The Nutcracker received its first complete production in the U.S. on 24 December 1944, performed by the San Francisco Ballet. This production used the ballet's original plot and was choreographed by Willam Christensen, who danced the role of the Cavalier.[1] Gisella Caccialanza, the wife of Lew Christensen, danced the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy.[2] The staging was a huge success and one critic wrote: ""We can't understand why a vehicle of such fantastic beauty and originality could be produced in Europe in 1892 with signal success [a factually erroneous claim] and never be produced in its entirety in this country until 1944. Perhaps choreographers will make up for lost time from now on.""[1] The company was the first in the U.S. to make the ballet an annual tradition, and for ten years, the only company in the United States performing the complete ballet, until George Balanchine's production opened in New York in 1954. (Annual productions of the San Francisco Ballet Nutcracker began in 1949.)
The San Francisco Ballet performs The Nutcracker annually to this day, though not necessarily with Christensen's choreography (their most recent version is choreographed by Helgi Tomasson). Christensen's Nutcracker continues in Salt Lake City, where it is performed annually by Christensen's Ballet West.[3] The stage success of the Christensen version marked the first step in making productions of The Nutcracker annual Christmas season traditions all over the world – a phenomenon that did not really come to flower until the late 1960s.

Balanchine's 1954 version of The Nutcracker
""Balanchine's Nutcracker"" redirects here. For other uses, see Nutcracker (disambiguation).
Choreographer George Balanchine's production of Peptipa and Tchaikovsky's 1892 ballet The Nutcracker is a broadly popular version of the ballet often performed in the United States. Conceived for the New York City Ballet, its premiere took place on February 2, 1954 at City Center, New York, with costumes by Karinska, sets by Horace Armistead and lighting and production by Jean Rosenthal.[1]
With the exception of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic,[2] it has been staged in New York every year since 1954, and many other productions throughout the United States either imitate it, or directly use its staging.


Staging[edit]
In contrast to other productions of the ballet, Balanchine's production of The Nutcracker uses more children, and give the principal roles of Clara/Marie[3] and Drosselmeyer's Nephew/Nutcracker/Prince to children instead of adults.[4]  This also causes the choreography for these characters to be simplified, and they largely only appear in the second act of the ballet as observers, except for the re-enactment of the fight with the Mouse King by the Prince. 
This production also changes out the Journey Through the Snow pas de deux; instead Clara/Marie faints onto her bed during the Mouse King battle and the bed moves across the stage while the Nutcracker transforms into the Prince, who awakens Clara/Marie and escorts her offstage.

On the screen[edit]
The first recorded performance was telecast by CBS in 1957 on the TV anthology The Seven Lively Arts; while Balanchine's archives refer to it as complete,[1] it was abridged to 55 minutes long.[4] This was not only the first telecast of the Balanchine version, but of any staging of the ballet. 
CBS's Playhouse 90 broadcast a more complete (but still abridged) version narrated by actress June Lockhart, on December 25, 1958; it was the first Nutcracker (and only installment of the entire Playhouse 90 series) broadcast in color.[5] This production featured Balanchine himself as Drosselmeyer.[6]
Excerpts from the Balanchine production were performed several times on several television variety shows of the mid-20th century, notably The Bell Telephone Hour and The Ed Sullivan Show.[1]
The complete Balanchine version was eventually made into a full-length feature film in 1993, and starred Macaulay Culkin in his only screen ballet rôle, as the Nutcracker, the Prince, and Drosselmeyer's nephew. The film was directed by Emile Ardolino, with narration by Kevin Kline. Ardolino died of AIDS only a few days before the film's release.[7]
In 2011, PBS presented that season's Balanchine Nutcracker as part of their ongoing series Live from Lincoln Center.[8][9] Directed by Alan Skog, it marked the first U.S. telecast of the Balanchine version in over fifty years. It was nominated for an Emmy Award in July 2012.[10]

Music[edit]
Balanchine adds to Tchaikovsky's score an entr'acte that the composer wrote for Act II of The Sleeping Beauty, but which is now seldom played in productions of that ballet. In Balanchine's Nutcracker, it is used as a transition between the departure of the guests and the battle with the mice. During this transition, the mother of Marie (as she is usually called in this version) appears in the living room and throws a blanket over the girl, who has crept downstairs and fallen asleep on the sofa; then Drosselmeyer appears, repairs the Nutcracker, and binds the jaw with a handkerchief. In addition, the Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy is moved from near the end of Act II to near the beginning of the second act, just after the Sugar Plum Fairy makes her first appearance. To help the musical transition, the tarantella that comes before the dance is cut. In the 1993 film version of the Balanchine version, just as in the telecast of the Baryshnikov one, the Miniature Overture is cut in half, and the opening credits are seen as the overture is heard. The film's final credits feature a reprise of the Trepak and the Waltz of the Flowers.

Ocean's Kingdom is a ballet choreographed by Peter Martins for the New York City Ballet to eponymous music and libretto by Paul McCartney. The work's premiere took place on 22 September 2011 at the Fall Gala in the David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center.[1]


Synopsis[edit]
Movement I: Ocean's Kingdom[edit]
The Princess Honorata lives with her father, King Ocean, in an underwater kingdom. In charge of her handmaidens is the somewhat sinister character Scala. Their idyllic existence is one day interrupted by intruders from the earthly kingdom, ruled by King Terra. He arrives with his band of aggressive followers and his younger brother Prince Stone. They are there to deliver an invitation to a grand ball. Prince Stone begins to fall in love with Princess Honorata.

Movement II: Hall of Dance[edit]
Guests arrive at the grand Hall of Dance and are treated to a spectacle of acrobatic dancing.  Wandering through their midst are three drunken lords. King Ocean and Honorata arrive and, once again, encounter King Terra's unruly retinue. The attraction between Stone and Honorarta becomes stronger as the rivalry between the dancers becomes more intense. At the end of the dance, unnoticed by Prince Stone and King Ocean, Honorata is kidnapped by King Terra, who secretly desires her himself, and his henchmen by the aid of the treacherous Scala.

Movement III: Imprisonment[edit]
Princess Honorata despairs of her fate as she is seen imprisoned in Terra's run-down palace. Prince Stone arrives, furious at Terra's actions and Scala's betrayal. He demands Honorata's release but is rebuffed by Terra. Scala realizes she was wrong to turn against her mistress and promises to aid Prince Stone with Honorata's release. The two lovers are reunited and fall into a passionate embrace before escaping.

Movement IV: Moonrise[edit]
As the moon rises outside Terra's palace, Scala, Honorata and Stone escape into the night. They are soon pursued by Terra and his warriors. Against the wishes of the lovers, Scala turns back to stop the advancing army, and though she is ignored by them she magically conjures up a storm which envelopes and destroys them. To the horror of Honorata and Stone, Scala also perishes. They escape and are met by friendly forces from the Ocean Kingdom. They return home in triumph and as the celebrations subside and the lovers are left alone, the spirit of Scala makes a final appearance to bless their union.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet-pantomime in one act by Leevi Madetoja
Okon FuokoBallet-pantomime by Leevi MadetojaThe composer (c. 1925)Opus58TextPoul KnudsenComposed1925 (1925)–1927DurationApprox. 77 minutesMovements1 actPremiereDate12 February 1930 (1930-02-12)LocationHelsinki, FinlandConductorMartti Similä [fi]PerformersFinnish National Opera
Okon Fuoko, Op. 58, is a ballet-pantomime for orchestra, vocal soloists, and choir by the Finnish composer Leevi Madetoja, who wrote the piece from 1925–27 concurrent with the composition of his Third Symphony. The Japonisme-influenced libretto is by Danish playwright Poul Knudsen. The story takes place in ancient Japan and, similar to Coppélia, centers around the (successful) efforts of the eponymous puppet-maker to bring a female creation to life. The result is a tragic love-triangle between the seductive doll, the infatuated Okon Fuoko, and his devastated wife. With its unique and exotic musical language, Okon Fuoko is one of Madetoja's ""finest"" scores; indeed, the last of his ""masterpieces"". 
Scheduling the ballet-pantomime's premiere in Copenhagen proved difficult and the production languished unperformed until 12 February 1930, when it received its premiere in Helsinki at the Finnish National Opera under the baton of Martti Similä [fi]. Although critics praised Madetoja's music, they panned Knudsen's awkward libretto as a dramatic failure. As a result, the  inaugural stage production received only three performances and thus marked the first setback of Madetoja's career, the previous major works of whom—three symphonies and an opera—the critics had received enthusiastically.
Today, the work is better known in its abridged form, a six-movement suite for orchestra that Madetoja excerpted from the stage production's score. The composer's plans for an additional two suites never materialized, although in 2009, Estonian conductor Arvo Volmer pieced together a collection of eight remaining numbers from the original score, dubbed  Okon Fuoko Suite II. Volmer, conducting the Oulu Symphony Orchestra, also has produced the only recording of the complete score.


History[edit]
While on his way to Paris in 1925, Madetoja had met a music publisher from Copenhagen, Wilhelm Hansen, who placed him into contact with the Danish playwright Poul Knudsen. A libretto for a new ballet-pantomime, based upon ""exotic"" Japanese themes, was on offer and Madetoja accepted the project with alacrity. In fact, the libretto was first offered to Jean Sibelius, who had earlier collaborated with Knudsen on the ballet-pantomime Scaramouche, Op. 71. (1913; fp. 1922). Sibelius, however, was at the time deep into the composition of his Sixth Symphony and thus refused the project.[1]
Having outlined his plan for the new commission while staying in Houilles, Madetoja more or less composed the Third Symphony and Okon Fuoko simultaneously, although the pressure to complete the former was so great that he was compelled to place the ballet-pantomime aside until December 1926. Although Madetoja completed the score in late 1927, scheduling the ballet-pantomime's premiere in Copenhagen proved difficult, despite the enthusiasm of the chief conductor of the Royal Danish Orchestra,  Georg Høeberg, who after a test rehearsal had proclaimed the score a ""masterpiece"".[2] The primary cause of the delay appears to have been the difficulty of casting a lead actor, as the part required both singing and miming; Knudsen insisted upon—and opted to wait for—an actor then on leave from the theatre, Johannes Poulsen.[3]
The production languished unperformed until it (finally) received its premiere on 12 February 1930, not in Copenhagen but rather in Helsinki, at the Finnish National Opera under the baton of Martti Similä [fi].[4] The performance was the first significant setback of Madetoja's career: although the critics ""unanimously praised"" Madetoja's music, the consensus opinion was that Knudsen's libretto—with its awkward mixture of song, melodramatic spoken dialogue, dance, and pantomime—was a dramatic failure. In the end, Okon Fuoko received only three performances total and the Danish premiere never took place.

Overall, the critics have received Okon Fuoko favorably. In his review of Volmer’s recording of the complete ballet-pantomime, Fanfare’s Phillip Scott notes that in the score the typically-nationalistic Madetoja ""[resists] any temptation to whip up excitement,"" instead utilizing an orchestra ""pared back to the barest essentials"" and embracing a sound world that is ""cool"", ""stark"", and ""emotionally detached"". Nevertheless, Scott finds that Okon Fuoko ""weaves a powerful, cumulative spell"", its ""beguiling … gentle, pentatonic melodies"" aided by Volmer’s ""thoughtful … beautifully recorded"" performance, and finishes by giving the disc a favorable recommendation.[citation needed] The American Record Guide's Jack Sullivan also applauds Volmer's massive undertaking, describing Madetoja's ""hypnotic"" score as having ""melody aplenty and attractive harmony"", although he finds the score's ""subtlety and delicacy"" to be its ""most striking"" feature. Indeed, with music that is ""by turns rapturous, pungent, and tragic,"" Sullivan concludes that a listener could be forgiven for wondering how on earth Okon Fuoko has been neglected for so long.[citation needed]

Ondine is a ballet in three acts created by the choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton and composer Hans Werner Henze. Ashton originally produced Ondine for the Royal Ballet in 1958, with Henze commissioned to produce the original score, published as Undine, which has since been restaged by other choreographers. The ballet was adapted from a novella titled Undine by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué and it tells the tale of a water nymph who is the object of desire of a young prince named Palemon. The première of the ballet took place at the Royal Opera House, London, on 27 October 1958, with the composer as guest conductor.[1] The first major revival of this Ashton/Henze production took place in 1988.


History[edit]
The three-act ballet of Ondine was commissioned and produced for The Royal Ballet in 1958 by the choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton. The resulting ballet was a collaboration between Ashton and the German composer Hans Werner Henze, who was commissioned to write the score. It is the only full length ballet that Ashton choreographed to original music, and the score is regarded as a rarity by musicians, as it is a ""20th century full-length ballet score that has the depth of a masterwork"".[2]
The ballet was originally intended as a vehicle for The Royal Ballet's then prima ballerina, Margot Fonteyn and the title role of Ondine was choreographed specially for her and led one critic to describe the ballet as ""a concerto for Fonteyn"". From its première in 1958 until the work was removed from the repertoire in 1966, nearly every performance of Ondine saw Fonteyn cast in the lead role, with the only occasional exceptions seeing Nadia Nerina and Svetlana Beriosova dancing the role. Maria Almeida became the first ballerina to dance the role of Ondine in a revival, with Anthony Dowell dancing the role of Palemon. Staged in 1988 and conducted by Isaiah Jackson, the revival was a success and the ballet has been regularly performed ever since.

Music[edit]
Ashton initially approached Sir William Walton to compose the score for Ondine. They had worked together before on a ballet called The Quest for the Sadler's Wells company in 1943,[3] and agreed to collaborate again for the 1955–56 season; they decided on Macbeth as their subject. Fonteyn, however, was firmly opposed to playing Lady Macbeth, and was not enthused by Ashton's next suggestion, Miranda in a ballet of The Tempest.[4] By the time Ashton had lighted on Ondine as an alternative, Walton was immersed in work on a concerto. He suggested that his friend Henze be approached. Accordingly, the music was commissioned from Henze, who titled the score Undine.[4]
Henze and Ashton met at the former's home on the island of Ischia, just across the bay from Naples, to decide their key approaches to this new ballet.[5] They decided to ignore the northern origins of Fouqué's novella Undine and move it to the Mediterranean. Ashton and Henze chose Lila de Nobili to design the set and costumes. She was described by Henze as ""an Italian bewitched by English landscape and culture"", however her first intention was to make the sets in the style that might have been seen on the stage of La Scala a hundred years earlier.[5] However, Henze and Ashton had decided not to make their ballet a mix of all the great works of the nineteenth century, but rather that it would be the product of their own contemporary sensibilities with references to other works. Eventually, the three of them decided that Ondine would have a ""gothic-revival"" setting.
Despite his experience in the ballet world,[5] Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him clearly what he liked and what he did not like in music for dance. Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised that he would have to revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds were such a contrast to the piano score and made him think very differently.[2]
Henze later arranged the Wedding Music for wind orchestra in 1957 and a further two orchestral suites in 1958.

Critical reception[edit]
After its première in 1958 it was greeted with mixed, half-hearted reviews,[6] although the first night reviews of Ondine were unanimous about one thing: Fonteyn's triumph in the title role. A.V.Coton spoke of ""the supernormal sensitivity of feeling, interaction and mutual understanding which exists between Ashton and his heroine"", and Cyril Beaumont saw the ballet as Ashton's ""greatest gift"" to his ballerina. Nothing else about the piece pleased everybody, though most reviewers liked Lila de Nobili's designs and praised the contribution of the supporting cast – Beaumont called Alexander Grant's Tirrenio ""of Miltonic stature, magnificently danced and mimed.""[7] Edwin Denby dismissed Ondine: after praising Fonteyn he said ""But the ballet is foolish, and everyone noticed"".[5] Most critics disliked the music and Mary Clarke was in the minority when she called it ""rich and romantic and superbly rhythmical"". Fernau Hall thought Henze showed ""little understanding of the needs of classical dancing"", and that Ondine would establish itself firmly in the repertoire ""if it were not for Henze's music"".[7]
In 1958 the ballet was widely seen as having choreography and décor in harmony with each other but fighting with the music; now it's the choreography and the music which seem to speak the same language, while the sets look not only backward but to the north.[5] Even when it was revived in 1988, it was hailed neither as a disaster nor as a lost masterpiece.[6] Henze's modern music is also perceived as a reason for the few performances of this ballet before its revival in the 1990s.

Synopsis[edit]
Ondine bears a resemblance to The Little Mermaid. The story derives from Fouqué's novella Undine, the tale of a water-nymph who marries a mortal. Similar to other 19th century fairy tales, the plot is based on man (Palemon) encountering the supernatural (the water nymph Ondine), but the outcome is rather different from many of the 19th century classics: here, it is the man that dies, and the female character survives.[8] Ondine makes her first entrance from a fountain, shivering in the cold air as we would in water, and dances with her shadow, which she has never seen before. She meets the hero, Palemon, and is astonished when she feels his heartbeat as she doesn't possess a heart. Palemon deserts Berta, whom he has been courting, and decides to marry Ondine. During a particularly strong storm while at sea, Ondine is lost overboard. Palemon survives the shipwreck created by the angry Ondines and, believing Ondine is lost, ends up marrying Berta. Ondine returns, however, and is heartbroken when she discovers Palemon's unfaithfulness. When she kisses him, he dies and she brings his body back into the sea with her forever.
In the published score, as with the title of the ballet, Henze also retained the original spellings of the character names.  The London ballet production was given as Ondine, but the score was titled Undine, and names the lead character as Undine.  Henze also uses the original name Beatrice rather than Berta.

Principal characters[edit]
Ondine (Undine)
The title role is undoubtedly the main focus of the ballet. She is a gentle water sprite who the audience discovers dancing in a waterfall and then with her own shadow. Her love for Palemon is deep, which is what makes his unfaithfulness so devastating and dramatic.

Palemon
The male lead is bewitched by the feminine allure of Ondine. He has never seen a creature as lovely as her and decides to marry Ondine, forsaking his betrothed, Beatrice (Berta). Similar to the Prince in Swan Lake, Palemon is destroyed by breaking the trust of his intended.

Berta (Beatrice)
She is the perfect female contrast to Ondine. Ondine belongs to the sea, whereas Berta is definitely from the land. She is manipulative, possessive and highly demanding, while Ondine is gentle and loving.

Tirrenio
He is the uncle of Ondine and also Lord of the Mediterranean Sea. He tries to warn Ondine that what she intends to do with Palemon goes against what is expected of her. When she chooses not to listen to his advice, he creates the conditions for a shipwreck where she is returned to the sea. When Ondine once again finds Palemon and realises how he has betrayed her, Tirrenio exacts a terrible revenge with his fellow Undines by causing death and destruction for all Palemon's guests.

The music[edit]
Since the original 1958 production of the ballet, the score has been published as a standalone work, and has been used for other dance productions, which have also used the title Undine.[citation needed]
The score is constructed with the certainty of technical accomplishment and inlaid with a lyricism that emanated from his experience of Italian life and Mediterranean colour.[neutrality is disputed] The score combines various genres, including the Neoclassicism from his early years. This combination of the genres of early German Romanticism and the neoclassicism of Stravinsky gives the score a 'modern' sound ""automatically made it anathema to the avant-garde of the 1950s"".[9] Therefore, the music was often seen as revolutionary and not suited to ballet.

Act 1[edit]
The score has a slow opening and immediately provides a romantic sense of mystery. However, the music then launches into a quicker tempo, brass fanfares propelling the music along with a rhythmically incisive motif. An andante section for strings follows using a straightforward lilting rhythm. The simplicity of this section is a marked contrast to the next, marked vivace where the different parts of the orchestra compete with each other with an underlying consistent rhythmic drive. The following section is also manufactured of contrasts with lyrical strings followed by a solo clarinet and sparse accompaniment. High strings, harp (for the watery effect) and occasional percussion provide another contrasting orchestral sound, before the composer again re-assembles his palette of orchestral colours, using solo instruments in small groups, or alone, or high violins in long notes soaring above moving fragments of ideas below. The finale of Act 1 has an uneven rhythm with sudden accents darting about in Stravinskian fashion, the music being punctuated here and there by astringent wind chords.[2]

Act 2[edit]
This act begins by reestablishing the aura of romantic mystery which began Act 1. This is evoked by the use of high violins and wind chords together, similar to that of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The first movement is characterised by the constant change of tempo, while the second picks up influences from other musical styles in particular that of rhythmic impulse and swooning which characterised Ravel's work. The next movement features solid writing for a chorus of brass instruments, after which high violins are heard over a very low accompaniment. This section also features many solos for various instruments, followed by a pas de trois above a gently undulating accompaniment where lyrical melody lines are heard, with the oboe able to penetrate the whole texture in expressive fashion.[2] The following variation is typical of 19th century ballet music and begins with the violins before spreading to the rest of the orchestra. Brass, prominent timpani and incisive pizzicato chords in the strings culminate in a sense of urgency in the music which prepares for the musical tension in the final act.

Act 3[edit]
This act begins with a striking unison theme in the strings, soon interrupted by strident brass. This theme intensifies throughout the opening movement, recitative. The next movement, adagio, features a sweeter sound in the strings with a solo violin heard floating above the rest of the orchestral texture. The con elegenza that follows is marked by the sweeping sound of violins. Brass fanfares then introduce the pas de seize and this adagio contrasts the horns with high woodwind, while the harp adds to this effect. The tempo of the pas de seize varies and quiet lyrical moments may suddenly be interrupted by incisive brass and timpani. This section finishes with a Largo solenne movement. The connection between that movement and the final divertissement, marked Scene, begins with a vigorous and brilliant entrée. A pas de six in the same tempo includes virtuoso writing for the piano, which leads the orchestra for the ensuing pas de trois, though the orchestra controls the second pas de trois while the piano has more virtuoso work with rippling cascades of notes; before the Stravinskian rhythms emerge for piano and orchestra at the beginning of the pas de dix-huit. The orchestral momentum, of high violins en masse, sprightly wind writing, brass chords punctuating the highly charged rhythmic style, and a continuation of bravura piano writing, is maintained throughout the opening of the pas de six that follows. The orchestra then introduces a valse for a general dance (pas d’ensemble) that could almost belong to one of Ravel's more advanced scores.[2] A pas d’action then begins to prepare for the finale. The tempo slows down, while ""sparse textures with solo instrumental sounds floating above quiet accompanimental figures create a different sound world"".[2] The strings gently introduce the Dance of Sorrow, which then gains in intensity with a richer string texture. During the next variation, oboe, harp, and pitched percussion provide another watery timbre before the ballet moves to the final pas de deux. The final movement starts with gently pulsing chords that have a sweet but melancholy dissonance as Palemon is kissed by Ondine and dies.

Ashton's choreography and setting[edit]
Dame Margot Fonteyn as Ondine in bronze by Nathan David, 1974
The consensus on Ashton's Ondine is that it has some very good things in it – and this is true; as is the implication that it is otherwise unsuccessful, not least because the music (which greatly disappointed Ashton himself) largely fails, except in the storm of Act II and the divertissements of Act III.[10] According to many critics, the music did not suit Ashton ""who had been hoping for music as ""radiant"" as the Mediterranean from which its heroine was born"".[6] Yet the music does seem to fit its watery theme well: there are some beautiful passages to Ondine's Act 3 ""swimming"" solo where the music seems thin and transparent as watercolour, and entirely suited to this sketch of the sea.[8] The ballet is also a mixture of both the 19th and the 20th century, for the plot is quintessentially romantic while the music and choreography are more modern. Although it bore all the marks of Ashton's familiarly gentle, classically oriented manner, it discarded the classical ballet conventions that appear in such Ashton successes as Cinderella and Sylvia. What he was trying to suggest, says Ashton, was ""the ebb and flow of the sea: I aimed at an unbroken continuity of dance, which would remove the distinction between aria and recitative."" As a result, Ondine offered few pyrotechnics, gained its effects instead through sinuous mass movements in which the undulation of arm and body suggested forests of sea plants stirring to unseen tides. The sense of submarine fantasy was reinforced by Stage Designer Lila de Nobili's fine scenery: a castle of mist and fruitfulness, shadowy crags and waterfalls, aqueous skies streaked pink and green.[11]
Ondine is not a classical construction with great set pieces (except for the wedding divertissement in the third act) or grand formal pas de deux, but a continuous, flowing narrative. However, this narrative is itself not very strong and there is no real explanation of why the lovers are on a ship in Act 2, or what exactly has passed between Acts 2 and 3 to convince Palemon to return to his mortal lover, Beatrice (Berta).[8] The work uses classical ballet vocabulary, but the form varies a great deal from the 19th century classics. Unlike them, is through-composed: there are no breaks for bows to the audience built in and (at least until the third-act divertissement) no bravura variations to self-consciously elicit the audience's response.[8] Henze's glittering music is the dominating force, although it is a difficult score to dance to, with the pulse well hidden within its general sheen, but it is atmospheric and often exciting, bringing the close of Act I to a climax.[12]
Although the narrative is not strong, the setting is and displays a ""most convincing feel of the sea"" and the ""shimmer of water"" which is very effective in this ballet which is filled with images of water and particularly of the sea.[8] The first act of the ballet takes place in the courtyard of the castle of Palemon where Ondine is seen dancing in the waterfall. Other settings include a scene with Tirrenio and the ondines while another is on a ship during wild storm at sea where the sensation of motion while being on board ship is strong enough to make the audience seasick.[8] The third act takes place in the Castle of Palemon located near the sea. The final tableau is not only exquisitely beautiful, with Ondine grieving over the body of her lover, but the surrounding ondines, their arms drifting like seaweed in the dim green light, uncannily evoke the shifting currents under the sea.[8]
When Fonteyn danced the lead, the ballet was about her and her performance; however good today's interpreters may be, none has the mystique to reduce everyone else to the background, and so the supporting roles are now much more visible and need to be much more strongly depicted.[5] It is generally accepted that Tirrenio was originally the most completely worked out role, inherited from Alexander Grant's lack of awe for Fonteyn; however the role has become difficult to cast as it was created to showcase Grant's unique mixture of gifts – classical virtuosity and flair for characterisation.[13]

Revivals[edit]
Although it was much lauded at the time, Ashton's Ondine disappeared from the repertory of The Royal Ballet for twenty years or so before Sir Anthony Dowell persuaded Ashton to let him revive it in 1988.[8] It has become more entrenched in The Royal Ballet's repertoire and thus gives the audience a chance to evaluate this work without the aura that Fonteyn brought to it. Maria Almeida was chosen to revive the lead role in 1990 and Viviana Durante has subsequently continued in the tradition of Fonteyn. The role of Palemon was revived by Anthony Dowell and has subsequently been danced by Jonathon Cope. It was revived again for the 2008/2009 season at the Royal Opera House with Tamara Rojo and Edward Watson.
Ashton's choreography has so far had only one full production outside The Royal Ballet, by the Ballet of the Teatro alla Scala, Milan on 21 April 2000.[7] Some commentators have noted that this is perhaps a consequence of its length (around 100 minutes) which does not compare with other twentieth century ballets.[9] The ballet has also been staged at Sadler's Wells, London and the Metropolitan Opera House, New York.

Other productions[edit]
Following the original staging by The Royal Ballet, the Ashton/Henze production was later restaged in New York in 1960, and then again at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan on 21 April 2000, a performance conducted by Patrick Fournillier.
Other choreographers have used Henze's music, including Youri Vámos for the ballet of the Deutsche Oper Berlin (1987)[14] and Torsten Händler in Chemnitz[15] and the Semperoper Ballett in Dresden, Germany has staged it regularly from 1989 as part of its repertoire using modern design. It was performed at the Volkstheater in Rostock in March 2009.

Ondine is a ballet in three acts created by the choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton and composer Hans Werner Henze. Ashton originally produced Ondine for the Royal Ballet in 1958, with Henze commissioned to produce the original score, published as Undine, which has since been restaged by other choreographers. The ballet was adapted from a novella titled Undine by Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué and it tells the tale of a water nymph who is the object of desire of a young prince named Palemon. The première of the ballet took place at the Royal Opera House, London, on 27 October 1958, with the composer as guest conductor.[1] The first major revival of this Ashton/Henze production took place in 1988.


History[edit]
The three-act ballet of Ondine was commissioned and produced for The Royal Ballet in 1958 by the choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton. The resulting ballet was a collaboration between Ashton and the German composer Hans Werner Henze, who was commissioned to write the score. It is the only full length ballet that Ashton choreographed to original music, and the score is regarded as a rarity by musicians, as it is a ""20th century full-length ballet score that has the depth of a masterwork"".[2]
The ballet was originally intended as a vehicle for The Royal Ballet's then prima ballerina, Margot Fonteyn and the title role of Ondine was choreographed specially for her and led one critic to describe the ballet as ""a concerto for Fonteyn"". From its première in 1958 until the work was removed from the repertoire in 1966, nearly every performance of Ondine saw Fonteyn cast in the lead role, with the only occasional exceptions seeing Nadia Nerina and Svetlana Beriosova dancing the role. Maria Almeida became the first ballerina to dance the role of Ondine in a revival, with Anthony Dowell dancing the role of Palemon. Staged in 1988 and conducted by Isaiah Jackson, the revival was a success and the ballet has been regularly performed ever since.

Music[edit]
Ashton initially approached Sir William Walton to compose the score for Ondine. They had worked together before on a ballet called The Quest for the Sadler's Wells company in 1943,[3] and agreed to collaborate again for the 1955–56 season; they decided on Macbeth as their subject. Fonteyn, however, was firmly opposed to playing Lady Macbeth, and was not enthused by Ashton's next suggestion, Miranda in a ballet of The Tempest.[4] By the time Ashton had lighted on Ondine as an alternative, Walton was immersed in work on a concerto. He suggested that his friend Henze be approached. Accordingly, the music was commissioned from Henze, who titled the score Undine.[4]
Henze and Ashton met at the former's home on the island of Ischia, just across the bay from Naples, to decide their key approaches to this new ballet.[5] They decided to ignore the northern origins of Fouqué's novella Undine and move it to the Mediterranean. Ashton and Henze chose Lila de Nobili to design the set and costumes. She was described by Henze as ""an Italian bewitched by English landscape and culture"", however her first intention was to make the sets in the style that might have been seen on the stage of La Scala a hundred years earlier.[5] However, Henze and Ashton had decided not to make their ballet a mix of all the great works of the nineteenth century, but rather that it would be the product of their own contemporary sensibilities with references to other works. Eventually, the three of them decided that Ondine would have a ""gothic-revival"" setting.
Despite his experience in the ballet world,[5] Henze had never before composed a subject in the romantic style which Ashton requested, however Ashton had been impressed by Henze's treatment of magical material in his opera König Hirsch. Henze attended many ballet performances at Covent Garden, frequently accompanied by Ashton who told him clearly what he liked and what he did not like in music for dance. Eventually the work was completed, but when Ashton heard a recording of the orchestrated score he realised that he would have to revise his ideas; the sustained orchestral sounds were such a contrast to the piano score and made him think very differently.[2]
Henze later arranged the Wedding Music for wind orchestra in 1957 and a further two orchestral suites in 1958.

Critical reception[edit]
After its première in 1958 it was greeted with mixed, half-hearted reviews,[6] although the first night reviews of Ondine were unanimous about one thing: Fonteyn's triumph in the title role. A.V.Coton spoke of ""the supernormal sensitivity of feeling, interaction and mutual understanding which exists between Ashton and his heroine"", and Cyril Beaumont saw the ballet as Ashton's ""greatest gift"" to his ballerina. Nothing else about the piece pleased everybody, though most reviewers liked Lila de Nobili's designs and praised the contribution of the supporting cast – Beaumont called Alexander Grant's Tirrenio ""of Miltonic stature, magnificently danced and mimed.""[7] Edwin Denby dismissed Ondine: after praising Fonteyn he said ""But the ballet is foolish, and everyone noticed"".[5] Most critics disliked the music and Mary Clarke was in the minority when she called it ""rich and romantic and superbly rhythmical"". Fernau Hall thought Henze showed ""little understanding of the needs of classical dancing"", and that Ondine would establish itself firmly in the repertoire ""if it were not for Henze's music"".[7]
In 1958 the ballet was widely seen as having choreography and décor in harmony with each other but fighting with the music; now it's the choreography and the music which seem to speak the same language, while the sets look not only backward but to the north.[5] Even when it was revived in 1988, it was hailed neither as a disaster nor as a lost masterpiece.[6] Henze's modern music is also perceived as a reason for the few performances of this ballet before its revival in the 1990s.

Synopsis[edit]
Ondine bears a resemblance to The Little Mermaid. The story derives from Fouqué's novella Undine, the tale of a water-nymph who marries a mortal. Similar to other 19th century fairy tales, the plot is based on man (Palemon) encountering the supernatural (the water nymph Ondine), but the outcome is rather different from many of the 19th century classics: here, it is the man that dies, and the female character survives.[8] Ondine makes her first entrance from a fountain, shivering in the cold air as we would in water, and dances with her shadow, which she has never seen before. She meets the hero, Palemon, and is astonished when she feels his heartbeat as she doesn't possess a heart. Palemon deserts Berta, whom he has been courting, and decides to marry Ondine. During a particularly strong storm while at sea, Ondine is lost overboard. Palemon survives the shipwreck created by the angry Ondines and, believing Ondine is lost, ends up marrying Berta. Ondine returns, however, and is heartbroken when she discovers Palemon's unfaithfulness. When she kisses him, he dies and she brings his body back into the sea with her forever.
In the published score, as with the title of the ballet, Henze also retained the original spellings of the character names.  The London ballet production was given as Ondine, but the score was titled Undine, and names the lead character as Undine.  Henze also uses the original name Beatrice rather than Berta.

Principal characters[edit]
Ondine (Undine)
The title role is undoubtedly the main focus of the ballet. She is a gentle water sprite who the audience discovers dancing in a waterfall and then with her own shadow. Her love for Palemon is deep, which is what makes his unfaithfulness so devastating and dramatic.

Palemon
The male lead is bewitched by the feminine allure of Ondine. He has never seen a creature as lovely as her and decides to marry Ondine, forsaking his betrothed, Beatrice (Berta). Similar to the Prince in Swan Lake, Palemon is destroyed by breaking the trust of his intended.

Berta (Beatrice)
She is the perfect female contrast to Ondine. Ondine belongs to the sea, whereas Berta is definitely from the land. She is manipulative, possessive and highly demanding, while Ondine is gentle and loving.

Tirrenio
He is the uncle of Ondine and also Lord of the Mediterranean Sea. He tries to warn Ondine that what she intends to do with Palemon goes against what is expected of her. When she chooses not to listen to his advice, he creates the conditions for a shipwreck where she is returned to the sea. When Ondine once again finds Palemon and realises how he has betrayed her, Tirrenio exacts a terrible revenge with his fellow Undines by causing death and destruction for all Palemon's guests.

The music[edit]
Since the original 1958 production of the ballet, the score has been published as a standalone work, and has been used for other dance productions, which have also used the title Undine.[citation needed]
The score is constructed with the certainty of technical accomplishment and inlaid with a lyricism that emanated from his experience of Italian life and Mediterranean colour.[neutrality is disputed] The score combines various genres, including the Neoclassicism from his early years. This combination of the genres of early German Romanticism and the neoclassicism of Stravinsky gives the score a 'modern' sound ""automatically made it anathema to the avant-garde of the 1950s"".[9] Therefore, the music was often seen as revolutionary and not suited to ballet.

Act 1[edit]
The score has a slow opening and immediately provides a romantic sense of mystery. However, the music then launches into a quicker tempo, brass fanfares propelling the music along with a rhythmically incisive motif. An andante section for strings follows using a straightforward lilting rhythm. The simplicity of this section is a marked contrast to the next, marked vivace where the different parts of the orchestra compete with each other with an underlying consistent rhythmic drive. The following section is also manufactured of contrasts with lyrical strings followed by a solo clarinet and sparse accompaniment. High strings, harp (for the watery effect) and occasional percussion provide another contrasting orchestral sound, before the composer again re-assembles his palette of orchestral colours, using solo instruments in small groups, or alone, or high violins in long notes soaring above moving fragments of ideas below. The finale of Act 1 has an uneven rhythm with sudden accents darting about in Stravinskian fashion, the music being punctuated here and there by astringent wind chords.[2]

Act 2[edit]
This act begins by reestablishing the aura of romantic mystery which began Act 1. This is evoked by the use of high violins and wind chords together, similar to that of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. The first movement is characterised by the constant change of tempo, while the second picks up influences from other musical styles in particular that of rhythmic impulse and swooning which characterised Ravel's work. The next movement features solid writing for a chorus of brass instruments, after which high violins are heard over a very low accompaniment. This section also features many solos for various instruments, followed by a pas de trois above a gently undulating accompaniment where lyrical melody lines are heard, with the oboe able to penetrate the whole texture in expressive fashion.[2] The following variation is typical of 19th century ballet music and begins with the violins before spreading to the rest of the orchestra. Brass, prominent timpani and incisive pizzicato chords in the strings culminate in a sense of urgency in the music which prepares for the musical tension in the final act.

Act 3[edit]
This act begins with a striking unison theme in the strings, soon interrupted by strident brass. This theme intensifies throughout the opening movement, recitative. The next movement, adagio, features a sweeter sound in the strings with a solo violin heard floating above the rest of the orchestral texture. The con elegenza that follows is marked by the sweeping sound of violins. Brass fanfares then introduce the pas de seize and this adagio contrasts the horns with high woodwind, while the harp adds to this effect. The tempo of the pas de seize varies and quiet lyrical moments may suddenly be interrupted by incisive brass and timpani. This section finishes with a Largo solenne movement. The connection between that movement and the final divertissement, marked Scene, begins with a vigorous and brilliant entrée. A pas de six in the same tempo includes virtuoso writing for the piano, which leads the orchestra for the ensuing pas de trois, though the orchestra controls the second pas de trois while the piano has more virtuoso work with rippling cascades of notes; before the Stravinskian rhythms emerge for piano and orchestra at the beginning of the pas de dix-huit. The orchestral momentum, of high violins en masse, sprightly wind writing, brass chords punctuating the highly charged rhythmic style, and a continuation of bravura piano writing, is maintained throughout the opening of the pas de six that follows. The orchestra then introduces a valse for a general dance (pas d’ensemble) that could almost belong to one of Ravel's more advanced scores.[2] A pas d’action then begins to prepare for the finale. The tempo slows down, while ""sparse textures with solo instrumental sounds floating above quiet accompanimental figures create a different sound world"".[2] The strings gently introduce the Dance of Sorrow, which then gains in intensity with a richer string texture. During the next variation, oboe, harp, and pitched percussion provide another watery timbre before the ballet moves to the final pas de deux. The final movement starts with gently pulsing chords that have a sweet but melancholy dissonance as Palemon is kissed by Ondine and dies.

Ashton's choreography and setting[edit]
Dame Margot Fonteyn as Ondine in bronze by Nathan David, 1974
The consensus on Ashton's Ondine is that it has some very good things in it – and this is true; as is the implication that it is otherwise unsuccessful, not least because the music (which greatly disappointed Ashton himself) largely fails, except in the storm of Act II and the divertissements of Act III.[10] According to many critics, the music did not suit Ashton ""who had been hoping for music as ""radiant"" as the Mediterranean from which its heroine was born"".[6] Yet the music does seem to fit its watery theme well: there are some beautiful passages to Ondine's Act 3 ""swimming"" solo where the music seems thin and transparent as watercolour, and entirely suited to this sketch of the sea.[8] The ballet is also a mixture of both the 19th and the 20th century, for the plot is quintessentially romantic while the music and choreography are more modern. Although it bore all the marks of Ashton's familiarly gentle, classically oriented manner, it discarded the classical ballet conventions that appear in such Ashton successes as Cinderella and Sylvia. What he was trying to suggest, says Ashton, was ""the ebb and flow of the sea: I aimed at an unbroken continuity of dance, which would remove the distinction between aria and recitative."" As a result, Ondine offered few pyrotechnics, gained its effects instead through sinuous mass movements in which the undulation of arm and body suggested forests of sea plants stirring to unseen tides. The sense of submarine fantasy was reinforced by Stage Designer Lila de Nobili's fine scenery: a castle of mist and fruitfulness, shadowy crags and waterfalls, aqueous skies streaked pink and green.[11]
Ondine is not a classical construction with great set pieces (except for the wedding divertissement in the third act) or grand formal pas de deux, but a continuous, flowing narrative. However, this narrative is itself not very strong and there is no real explanation of why the lovers are on a ship in Act 2, or what exactly has passed between Acts 2 and 3 to convince Palemon to return to his mortal lover, Beatrice (Berta).[8] The work uses classical ballet vocabulary, but the form varies a great deal from the 19th century classics. Unlike them, is through-composed: there are no breaks for bows to the audience built in and (at least until the third-act divertissement) no bravura variations to self-consciously elicit the audience's response.[8] Henze's glittering music is the dominating force, although it is a difficult score to dance to, with the pulse well hidden within its general sheen, but it is atmospheric and often exciting, bringing the close of Act I to a climax.[12]
Although the narrative is not strong, the setting is and displays a ""most convincing feel of the sea"" and the ""shimmer of water"" which is very effective in this ballet which is filled with images of water and particularly of the sea.[8] The first act of the ballet takes place in the courtyard of the castle of Palemon where Ondine is seen dancing in the waterfall. Other settings include a scene with Tirrenio and the ondines while another is on a ship during wild storm at sea where the sensation of motion while being on board ship is strong enough to make the audience seasick.[8] The third act takes place in the Castle of Palemon located near the sea. The final tableau is not only exquisitely beautiful, with Ondine grieving over the body of her lover, but the surrounding ondines, their arms drifting like seaweed in the dim green light, uncannily evoke the shifting currents under the sea.[8]
When Fonteyn danced the lead, the ballet was about her and her performance; however good today's interpreters may be, none has the mystique to reduce everyone else to the background, and so the supporting roles are now much more visible and need to be much more strongly depicted.[5] It is generally accepted that Tirrenio was originally the most completely worked out role, inherited from Alexander Grant's lack of awe for Fonteyn; however the role has become difficult to cast as it was created to showcase Grant's unique mixture of gifts – classical virtuosity and flair for characterisation.[13]

Revivals[edit]
Although it was much lauded at the time, Ashton's Ondine disappeared from the repertory of The Royal Ballet for twenty years or so before Sir Anthony Dowell persuaded Ashton to let him revive it in 1988.[8] It has become more entrenched in The Royal Ballet's repertoire and thus gives the audience a chance to evaluate this work without the aura that Fonteyn brought to it. Maria Almeida was chosen to revive the lead role in 1990 and Viviana Durante has subsequently continued in the tradition of Fonteyn. The role of Palemon was revived by Anthony Dowell and has subsequently been danced by Jonathon Cope. It was revived again for the 2008/2009 season at the Royal Opera House with Tamara Rojo and Edward Watson.
Ashton's choreography has so far had only one full production outside The Royal Ballet, by the Ballet of the Teatro alla Scala, Milan on 21 April 2000.[7] Some commentators have noted that this is perhaps a consequence of its length (around 100 minutes) which does not compare with other twentieth century ballets.[9] The ballet has also been staged at Sadler's Wells, London and the Metropolitan Opera House, New York.

Other productions[edit]
Following the original staging by The Royal Ballet, the Ashton/Henze production was later restaged in New York in 1960, and then again at the Teatro alla Scala, Milan on 21 April 2000, a performance conducted by Patrick Fournillier.
Other choreographers have used Henze's music, including Youri Vámos for the ballet of the Deutsche Oper Berlin (1987)[14] and Torsten Händler in Chemnitz[15] and the Semperoper Ballett in Dresden, Germany has staged it regularly from 1989 as part of its repertoire using modern design. It was performed at the Volkstheater in Rostock in March 2009.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet by Sergei Prokofiev


On the Dnieper (На Днепре), Op. 51, is a ballet in two scenes with prelude and epilogue by Sergei Prokofiev. Composed in 1931[1] as his fourth work in the genre, it resulted from a commission by the Ballet de l'Opéra National de Paris after the unexpected death in 1929 of Ballets Russes founder Sergei Diaghilev and after the success of The Prodigal Son. The premiere took place in 1932; a year later Prokofiev extracted an orchestral suite from the work, Op. 51 bis, using six of its twelve movements. 


Background[edit]
Sergei Diaghilev, the impresario who had led Ballets Russes to distinguished success, died suddenly in 1929, hence ending Prokofiev's collaboration with the troupe. (The Prodigal Son was the last such collaboration.) Seeing the success of the work, the Paris Opéra commissioned Prokofiev to write another ballet. Serge Lifar, formerly a close associate with Diaghilev, was responsible for creating the setting and choreography. However, he did not place any significance to the scenario. Rather, the ballet was created as a sequence of dances. On the Dnieper was the result of this collaboration.
Lifar, in his 1965 book La danse, said that he was disappointed with Prokofiev's score.  Lifar claimed to have been inspired by Russian folkdance, but acknowledges that critics found his own choreography insufficiently Russian.
Preparations for the ballet were marked by the sudden withdrawal of Olga Spessivtseva who was to have had the leading female role. Spessivsteva had had a series of successes with Lifar at the Paris Opera Ballet (Promethee, Giselle) and had unrequited feelings for him.  In his book The Three Graces: Anna Pavlova, Tamara Karsavina, Olga Spessivtseva (1959) Lifar describes how their personal situation came to a head during rehearsals.  ""The two heroines of this ballet were named Natasha and Olga.  I have already mentioned the friendship which had sprung up at this time between Natasha P... [Natalie Paley] and myself.  It was, therefore, perhaps a little cruel to give these two names, Natasha and Olga, to the heroines.  Be that as it may, the role of Olga was allotted to Spessivtseva, while the male part, Serge, was to be interpreted by me.  The crisis came when, at one of the rehearsals, Spessivtseva suddenly realized that it was with Natasha ... that in pursuance of the plot, I was to find happiness, whereas the leading, and, from the choreographic point of view, the most important role had been allotted to her, Olga!   This crisis, as always with her, developed with the speed of lightning.  Just as I had announced at rehearsal, that this was where my pas de deux tendre with Natasha would begin, Spessivtseva all of a sudden made a dash for the window.  In one bound I reached her, but, by that time she was already through it.  I just managed to clutch her arm.  My pianist, Leonide Gontcharov, who was hard on my heels, sprang to my assistance.  Olga hung there, suspended from our arms, thirty feet above the Place Charles-Garnier.  With great difficulty we managed to drag her back.  She fought, bit and scratched in an effort to break free ... Next day she did not turn up at rehearsal, but sent word to me that she had left the Opera forever.""

Analysis[edit]
Prokofiev continued to develop his lyrical line of composition in On the Dnieper, even more so than in The Prodigal Son. These two lyrical ballets provided much experience for the composer, who was about to start writing his first ballet in the Russian tradition: Romeo and Juliet.

Plot[edit]
Sergei, a Red Army soldier in the First World War returns to his village on the Dnieper and finds he is no-longer in love with Natasha his betrothed. Instead, he falls in love with Olga. Olga's parents intend for her to marry another man whom she does not love. Sergei and Olga's friends fight. Sergei falls, but the lovers are saved by the compassionate Natasha who helps the couple to escape the village.
The ballet contains 12 numbers, lasting around 40 minutes:

Prelude
Scene 1: The Meeting
Scene 1: Mime Scene
Scene 1: Pas de deux
Scene 1: Variation of the First Dancer
Scene 2: Betrothal
Scene 2: Bridegroom's Dance
Scene 2: Bride's Dance
Scene 2: Men's Dance
Scene 2: The Quarrel
Scene 2: Mime Scene
Epilogue
Premiere[edit]
The ballet was premiered on 16 December 1932, but it turned out to be a flop, especially when critics had been anticipating a work similar in character to The Prodigal Son. Because Prokofiev left for America the next day, he was unaware of the disappointed reviews. The ballet was withdrawn from the stage after a few performances, although Stravinsky and Milhaud warmly praised the music after the premiere. Afterwards, Prokofiev extracted an orchestral suite from the ballet (as he did to his other stage works) as Op. 51a.

Revival[edit]
In 2009 Alexei Ratmansky choreographed the Prokofiev score anew for American Ballet Theatre.  In his version, Sergei returns his village to discover that he no longer loves his sweetheart, Natalia, but is instead attracted to Olga, who is to wed another man.  ""Grief-stricken yet noble, Natalia unselfishly helps the young lovers, Sergei and Olga, to escape together to a life of happiness."" In the premiere of this version, Marcelo Gomes danced the role of Sergei, Paloma Herrera the role of Olga, Veronika Part the role of Natalia, and David Hallberg the role of Olga's Fiancé.

Opus 19/The Dreamer is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to Sergei Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1. The ballet premiered on June 14, 1979 at the New York State Theater, danced by the New York City Ballet.[1][2]

Production[edit]
External videos NYC Ballet's Taylor Stanley on Jerome Robbins' OPUS 19/THE DREAMER, YouTube video Opus 19/The Dreamer rehearsal - ft. Dylan Wald (Pacific Northwest Ballet), YouTube video
Opus 19/The Dreamer was created for Mikhail Baryshnikov and Patricia McBride, and features an ensemble of 12 dancers.[1] Baryshnikov joined the New York City Ballet in 1978, the year before Opus 19 was created, and soon after that he left to take over the directorship of the American Ballet Theatre.[3] As the lead man is on stage most of the time, it is a challenge to the dancer's stamina.[3]
In a 2019 interview, Baryshnikov said he could not recall the details of the creation process, but Robbins wanted ""to dance everything himself in sneakers and jeans. All those jumps. He always had to try everything."" Baryshnikov also said the ballet has ""no story and yet it’s a reflection of the music — he sits, she dances, and she sits, he dances.""[3] Though Baryshnikov rarely coaches, he worked with New York City Ballet dancers Gonzalo Garcia and Taylor Stanley on the lead role.[3] Garcia described the ballet as ""an artistic journey.""[3]
In 2020, in response to performance cancellations due to the coronavirus, New York City Ballet released a video of Opus 19/The Dreamer's first movement online, featuring Unity Phelan in her role debut and Garcia, filmed earlier that year.[4] The Pacific Northwest Ballet had also performed the ballet.[5]

Set design for Les Orientales by Léon Bakst
Vaslav Nijinsky performs in Les Orientales
Les Orientales is a choreographic divertissement by Michel Fokine. A production of Ballets Russes, it was premiered on June 25, 1910 at the Theatre National de l'Opera in Paris.
The ballet consisted of a series of oriental-themed dances performed by soloists Vaslav Nijinsky (Danse Siamoise and Kobold), Tamara Karsavina (Assyrian Dance), Vera Fokina, Alexander Orlov (Saracens’ Dance), Catherine Gheltzer and Alexander Volinine (pas de deux). The dances were choreographed by Michel Fokine and Marius Petipa. The music was by Alexander Glazunov, Christian Sinding, Anton Arensky, and Edvard Grieg.
Michel Fokine, who choreographed Vaslav Nijinsky's ""Danse Siamoise"", may have been “inspired by a Thai Classical troupe, the Nai But Mahin Dance Company, that Fokine had seen in St. Petersburg in 1900.”[1]
Léon Bakst started working on scenic design and costumes for Les Orientale in 1908. In 1909, Bakst made a name for himself as a scene-painter for Diaghilev with the Ballets Russes.He designed scenery and costumes for Cleopatra (1909), Scheherazade (1910), and Carnaval (1910). In 1910, Konstantin Korovin continued working on scenic design and costumes for Les Orientales in collaboration with Léon Bakst.

Orpheus is a thirty-minute neoclassical ballet in three tableaux composed by Igor Stravinsky in collaboration with choreographer George Balanchine  in Hollywood, California in 1947. The work was commissioned by the Ballet Society, which Balanchine founded together with Lincoln Kirstein and of which he was Artistic Director. Sets and costumes were created by Isamu Noguchi.


Structure[edit]
The original cast consisted of 30 dancers: Orpheus; Eurydice; the Dark Angel of Death; Apollo; the leader of the Furies; the leader of the Bacchantes; eight women Bacchantes; nine women in various roles (Friends to Orpheus, Furies, Pluto, Satyr, and Nature Spirits); and seven men as Lost Souls.
The action is divided into three tableaux and twelve dance episodes: 
(I. Tableau): Orpheus Weeps for Eurydice; Air de Danse; Dance of the Angel of Death; Interlude. (II. Tableau): Pas des furies; Air de danse (Orphée)/Interlude/Air de danse, conclusion; Pas d’action; Pas de deux; Interlude; Pas d’action. 
(III. Tableau): Apothéose d'Orphée.

Score[edit]
The score is among Stravinsky's most melodious. There is a wide dynamic range (reaching fortississimo, fff, at the moment when the Bacchantes seize and dismember Orpheus); but mostly the orchestra plays quietly, seldom rising above mezzoforte.
The size of the orchestra is very much ""neo-classical""; like Beethoven, Stravinsky has scored for pairs of woodwinds (except that, like Beethoven in his 5th Symphony, he has added a piccolo to the two flutes). This economy in the scoring is, like the quiet dynamics that predominate in Orpheus, in stark contrast to the composer's The Rite of Spring of 35 years before. Beethoven deployed three trombones in his 5th and 9th Symphonies, importing them from the world of operatic music; the use of three trombones then became the normal orchestral practice in the 19th century and up through the present day, but in Orpheus Stravinsky calls for only two.  The tuba is omitted entirely. Also strikingly different from The Rite of Spring is the absence of a percussion section and the use of only one timpanist.
There is an important role for the harp in Orpheus. This has a long tradition in classical music, in which the character of Orpheus is associated with that instrument, by analogy with the Ancient Greek lyre. Two important examples of this may be mentioned: Gluck’s opera Orfeo ed Euridice and Liszt’s symphonic poem Orpheus.
Stravinsky's neoclassicism occasionally extends to parody; one of the most extended examples in his work is to be found in the Air de Danse (Orphée) of the second tableau, in which an elegant ""Siciliana"" for reduced forces of harp, timpani, strings, and oboe duet (with cor anglais replacing one of the oboes after the interlude) evokes a late Baroque concerto. Stravinsky also creates a neo-Baroque parody—for a scene that also takes place in Hades—in his Perséphone of 1934.

History[edit]
The premiere took place on April 28, 1948, at City Center of Music and Drama, New York, and directly resulted in City Center's chairman, Morton Baum, inviting Balanchine and Kirstein to establish a resident company. The new company was named (or Ballet Society renamed) New York City Ballet and Balanchine remained its ballet master until his death.
The program for City Ballet's first performance at City Center, conducted by the composer, consisted of Orpheus, Concerto Barocco and Symphony in C on October 11, 1948.
Noguchi's rendition of Orpheus' lyre was adopted as – and remains – City Ballet's official symbol.

Othello is a ballet in three acts based on the play of the same name by William Shakespeare. Choreography by Lar Lubovitch is set to an orchestral score composed by Elliot Goldenthal and released commercially on the Varèse Sarabande label. Originally produced in 1997, the ballet was commissioned by the American Ballet Theatre and the San Francisco Ballet.
The score is generally less atonal than many of Goldenthal's film scores but vastly more complex as he is required to provide not only the music but also all of the complex ambience and to set the pace and rhythm for the dancers on the stage.[1]

Ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins


Other DancesChoreographerJerome RobbinsMusicFrédéric ChopinPremiereMay 9, 1976 (1976-05-09)Metropolitan Opera HouseDesignSanto LoquastoCreated forNatalia MakarovaMikhail Baryshnikov
Other Dances is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to music by Frédéric Chopin. It was created on Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov, and premiered on May 9, 1976, at a gala benefitting the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, held at Metropolitan Opera House. It was originally made as a pièce d'occasion, but after receiving critical acclaim, it was soon added to American Ballet Theatre and New York City Ballet's repertories.


Production[edit]
Other Dances was made as a pièce d'occasion for James Lipton's ""The Star Spangled Gala"", which benefited the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. Robbins had previously donated part of his profits from the musical Fiddler on the Roof to the library's dance collection.[1][2] It was funded by Eugenia ""Genya"" Doll, the wife of Henri George Doll and former wife of choreographer Léonide Massine, as a wedding gift to dancer Natalia Makarova, with her partner in the ballet being Mikhail Baryshnikov.[1] Both of them are Russians who had defected to the U.S. and are members of the American Ballet Theatre (ABT). Robbins had seen the two dancing with ABT and admired both of them.[3] Doll had danced with Robbins many years earlier.[4] It is set to Frédéric Chopin's music, including four mazurkas and one waltz, the latter previously used in Fokine's Les Sylphides. Robbins had previously used Chopin's works in The Concert, Dances at a Gathering, and its follow-up, In the Night.[5]
Rehearsals for Other Dances began in spring 1976.[1] At first, Robbins was concerned whether Baryshnikov, who was careful on the details, was ""grasp[ing] the nuances"". However, by the time the ballet was completed, he felt that ""one doesn't begin to say what he can do"". He was also impressed with Makarova's ""ability to do the most difficult adagio dancing with exquisite control and musicality"".[4] Santo Loquasto, the costume designer, found that Robbins ""was on his best behavior"" due to his admiration for Baryshnikov.[1] However, to ease the burden on the dancers and to avoid conflicts, Robbins also created some of the steps for other dancers beforehand.[1]
Baryshnikov thought ""the most difficult thing for [Robbins] was to find the form – the structure – of the ballet. He approached each section as a musical whole, and then had to work out the sequence in a way that was theatrically sound.""[6] Robbins would ask Baryshnikov to ""listen to the music"" and explain how he interpreted the music. He also did not use any ""verbal or psychological descriptions"", and used some very brief instructions.[6] In some rehearsals, Robbins would dance Baryshnikov's part and the latter would not dance at all. However, Baryshnikov noted by seeing him dance, he understood what Robbins wanted, and brought him ""closest to dancing it the way he wanted"". It also helped Baryshnikov learn the ballet quicker than he expected. He called Robbins ""stupendous"", and the experience of working with him ""was a complete revelation"".[6]

Choreography[edit]
Baryshnikov wrote, ""There is no idea for Other Dances, there is no story.""[6] It is 20 minutes long.[7] While the ballet follows the structure of a classical a pas de deux, with pas de deux, two solos and a coda, Baryshnikov noted it could have worked with any order.[6][3] The pianist is onstage during the ballet.[3] When one dancer performs a solo, the other dancer is offstage rather than watching onstage. Robbins made this choice as he knew Makarova and Baryshnikov would prefer to rest offstage.[3] After each section, the dancers bow to the audience, as Robbins thought the audience should applaud the pair.[3]
In her memoir, Makarova wrote, ""In Other Dances, the body seems to be weaving a shawl of valenciennes lace ... the hesitations, the subtle nuances, that fine understatement of movement that for me is the most precious feature of the romantic – and for that matter, of any – ballet.""[1] She added that when she and Baryshnikov dance Other Dances together, they ""always try to convey a certain dramatic message to the audience"".[1]
Baryshnikov added that while the ballet is ""very relaxed and harmonious"", it is also ""quite difficult"" due to it being long for a pas de deux, and sometimes ""it's harder to be relaxed onstage for that amount of time"" than dancing more virtuosic steps. He also found the ""calm and benign"" tension ""difficult to maintain"".[6] In a 2008 interview, Baryshnikov described Other Dances as ""utterly Slavic"" because both he and Makarova are Russians, and because of the way she moved her arms, which fascinated Robbins. He also noted the use of mazurka, stamping and arms were stem from character dancing.[8]

Music[edit]
All the music used in Other Dances are composed by Chopin, including:[9]

Mazurkas, Op. 17, No. 4
Mazurkas, Op. 41, No. 3
Waltz, Op. 64, No. 3
Mazurkas Op. 63, No. 2
Mazurkas, Op. 33, No. 2
Performances[edit]
Other Dances premiered on May 9, 1976, at ""The Star Spangled Gala"" held at the Metropolitan Opera House. The same night, Robbins was presented the Handel Medallion by Mayor Abraham Beame.[5]
Upon critical acclaim, the American Ballet Theatre, where Makarova and Baryshnikov were dancing at the time, acquired Other Dances shortly after it premiered.[2][3] In November, Robbins' company, the New York City Ballet, debuted the ballet, danced by Suzanne Farrell and Peter Martins. The costumes were also designed by Loquasto, but in mauve instead of the blue in the original production.[2]
In 2012, when Makarova received the Kennedy Center Honors, an excerpt of Other Dances was performed by Tiler Peck, a New York City Ballet principal dancer.[10]

Critical reception[edit]
On the premiere of Other Dances, New York Times critic Clive Barnes called it a ""masterpiece"". He compared it to Dances at a Gathering, another Robbins ballet to Chopin's music, and wrote, ""it could fit into Dances at a Gathering without a shudder of notice. It has precisely the original ballet's sense of place and style, of Slavic forms growing in an alien soil, of transposed dance images, character motions and national glints, into an oddly pure form of classic dance. There is no choreography — with its mixture of character fervor and classic grace — quite like it anywhere.""[5] In 1977, reviewing ABT performing Other Dances in London, Peter Williams of Dance and Dancers commented he would be happy to ""see both these dancers in this piece every night of my life"".[3]

Videography[edit]
In 1980, a performance of Other Dances with Makarova and Baryshnikov was filmed and released on the PBS broadcast Dance in America.[11]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




This article is about the McGregor ballet. For other uses, see Outlier (disambiguation).
Outlier is a ballet made by Wayne McGregor for New York City Ballet to Thomas Adès' Violin Concerto (Concentric Paths), Op. 24 (2005). The premiere  was Saturday, 14 May 2010 at the David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, New York. 
Concentric Paths, subtitle of the concerto for violin and chamber orchestra, refers to outliers who remain peripheral to actors having a common center. There is harmonious dance within the circle until an outlier intrudes, creating conflict among the men with regard to the women. The lighting is coded for mood: red for strong emotions, yellow for tranquil, grey for somber. The grouping of dancers in three movements reflects the triadic nature of the score.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


This article is about the 19th century ballet. For the Mexican singer, see Paquita la del Barrio.
Paquita is a ballet in two acts and three scenes originally choreographed by Joseph Mazilier to music by Édouard Deldevez and Ludwig Minkus. Paul Foucher received royalties as librettist.[1]


History[edit]
Paquita is the creation of French composer Édouard Deldevez and Paris Opéra Ballet Master Joseph Mazilier.[2] It was first presented at the Salle Le Peletier by the Paris Opera Ballet on 1 April 1846 and was retained in the repertory of the Opéra until 1851.[3]
In 1847, Paquita was staged for the first time in Russia for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg by Marius Petipa and Pierre-Frédéric Malavergne, being the first work ever staged by Petipa in Russia. In 1881, Petipa produced a revival of the ballet for which he added new pieces specially composed by Ludwig Minkus. This included the Paquita pas de trois for the first act and the Paquita grand pas classique and the Mazurka des enfants for the last act. Petipa's version of Paquita was retained in the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre until 1926.[3]
Petipa's 1881 additions for Paquita survived long after the full-length ballet left the stage. Today these pieces, particularly the Grand pas classique, are major cornerstones of the traditional classical ballet repertory and have been staged by ballet companies throughout the world.[3]
Petipa's choreography for the Imperial Ballet's production of Paquita was notated in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation around 1902. The notations were made while Petipa himself taught and rehearsed the great Anna Pavlova for her début in the title rôle. Today, this notation is part of the Sergeyev Collection, a cache of notations and other materials that document many of the works in the Imperial Ballet's repertory during the twilight of the Russian Empire.[4]
In 2001, director Brigitte Lefèvre asked French choreographer Pierre Lacotte to produce a revival of the full-length two act Paquita for the Paris Opera Ballet. Although Lacotte re-choreographed all of the ballet himself, he restored Joseph Mazilier's original mime sequences and mise-en-scène, as well as Petipa's 1881 additions.[5] Paquita was performed again by the Paris Opera in 2007.[6]
In 2014, the Stepanov notation expert Doug Fullington and Russian choreographer Alexei Ratmansky mounted a reconstruction of Petipa's final revival of Paquita for the Bayerisches Staatsballett.[7]

Plot[edit]
The story takes place in Spain during the presence  of Napoleon's army. The heroine is the young Romani girl, Paquita. Unbeknownst to Paquita, she is really of noble birth, having been abducted by Romani people when she was an infant. She saves the life of a young French officer, Lucien d'Hervilly, who is the target of a Spanish governor who desires to have him killed by Iñigo, a Roma chief. By way of a medallion she discovers that she is of noble birth, being in fact the cousin of Lucien. As such, she and the Officer are able to get married.[5]

History of the Paquita grand pas classique[edit]
In Marius Petipa and Ludwig Minkus's original staging of the Paquita grand pas classique in 1881, only one variation was included for the leading ballerina Ekaterina Vazem, being a polonaise arranged for solo violin.
Anna Pavlova included the Grand Pas classique in her company's repertory.[8]
Rudolf Nureyev staged the piece in 1964 for the Royal Academy of Dancing, and at La Scala in 1970. Nureyev also staged it for the Vienna State Opera Ballet and American Ballet Theatre in 1971.[9] For all of his productions of the work Nureyev used John Lanchbery's adaptation of the music. In 1984 Natalia Makarova staged a new version of the Paquita grand pas classique for American Ballet Theatre[8] with music again arranged by Lanchbery. To date the company still retains Makarova's staging in their repertory, and many companies throughout the world have staged her version of the piece.
In 1974 the Ballet Master Nikita Dolgushin produced a staging of the Paquita grand pas classique for the Maly Theatre Ballet of St. Petersburg. For his production Dolgushin called upon the former ballerina Elizaveta Gerdt—who performed in Marius Petipa's original version of the piece— to assist in restoring the Paquita grand pas classique to its form as performed during the early 20th century.
In 1978 the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's newly appointed artistic director Oleg Vinogradov staged a new version of the Paquita grand pas classique for the company, a staging largely based on the version Pyotr Gusev staged for the Maly Theatre Ballet in 1952. The Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet still retain Vinogradov's version in their repertory, and many companies throughout the world include his version of the piece in their repertories.

1917 ballet
This article is about Massine's ballet. For other uses, see Parade (disambiguation).
ParadeChoreographerLéonide MassineMusicErik SatiePremiereMay 18, 1917; 106 years ago (1917-05-18)Théâtre du Châtelet, ParisOriginal ballet companyBallets RussesDesignPablo Picasso
Parade is a ballet choreographed by Leonide Massine, with music by Erik Satie and a one-act scenario by Jean Cocteau. The ballet was composed in 1916–17 for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. The ballet premiered on Friday, May 18, 1917, at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, with costumes and sets designed by Pablo Picasso, choreography by Léonide Massine (who danced), and the orchestra conducted by Ernest Ansermet.


Overview[edit]
The idea of the ballet seems to have come from Jean Cocteau.[1] He had heard Satie's Trois morceaux en forme de poire (""Three Pieces in the Shape of a Pear"") in a concert and thought of writing a ballet scenario to such music. Satie welcomed the idea of composing ballet music (which he had never done before) but refused to allow any of his previous compositions to be used for the occasion, so Cocteau started writing a scenario (the theme being a publicity parade in which three groups of circus artists try to attract an audience to an indoor performance), to which Satie composed the music (with some additions to the orchestral score by Cocteau).[2]
Work on the production started in the middle of the First World War, with Cocteau traveling back and forth to the war front in Belgium during planning and pre-production.[3] The most difficult part of the creative process, however, seems to have been to convince Misia Edwards to support the idea of having this ballet performed by the Ballets Russes. She was easily offended but was trusted completely by Sergei Diaghilev for advice on his productions.[4] A first version of the music (for piano) was dedicated to Misia and performed in 1916.[5]
Eventually, after aborting some other plans (and some more intrigue), Diaghilev's support was won, and the choreography was entrusted to Léonide Massine, who had recently become the principal dancer of the Ballets Russes and lover of Diaghilev, replacing Vaslav Nijinsky who had left Paris shortly before the outbreak of the war.[6] The set and costume design was entrusted to the then-Cubist painter Pablo Picasso. In addition to the costume designs, Picasso also designed a curtain which illustrated a group of performers at a fair consuming dinner before a performance.[7] The Italian futurist artist Giacomo Balla aided Picasso in his creating the curtain and other designs for Parade.[8] In February 1917, all the collaborators, excluding Satie, met in Rome to begin working on Parade, scheduled to premiere in May.[9]

The poet Guillaume Apollinaire described Parade as ""a kind of surrealism"" (une sorte de surréalisme) when he wrote the program note in 1917, thus coining the word three years before Surrealism emerged as an art movement in Paris.[10] The English premiere of Parade, performed by the Ballets Russes, was performed at London's Empire Theatre on November 14, 1919, and became a cultural event.[11]
The ballet was remarkable[citation needed] for several reasons.
It was the first collaboration between Satie and Picasso, and also the first time either of them had worked on a ballet, thus making it the first time either collaborated with Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes.[citation needed]
The plot of Parade incorporated and was inspired by popular entertainments of the period, such as Parisian music-halls and American silent-films.[citation needed]
Much of the settings used in Parade's plot occurred outside of the formal Parisian theater, depicting the streets of Paris.[citation needed]
The plot reproduces various elements of everyday life such as the music hall and fairground. Before Parade, the use of popular entertainment materials was considered unsuitable for the elite world of the ballet.[citation needed]
The plot of Parade composed by Cocteau includes the failed attempt of a troupe of performers to attract audience members to view their show.[citation needed]
Some of Picasso's Cubist costumes were in solid cardboard, allowing the dancers only a minimum of movement.[citation needed]
The score contained several ""noise-making"" instruments (typewriter, foghorn, an assortment of milk bottles, pistol, and so on), which had been added by Cocteau (somewhat to the dismay of Satie).[citation needed] It is supposed[who?] that such additions by Cocteau showed his eagerness to create a succès de scandale, comparable to that of Igor Stravinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps which had been premiered by the Ballets Russes some years before, and caused no less scandal.[2] Although Parade was quite revolutionary, bringing common street entertainments to the elite, being scorned by audiences and being praised by critics,[citation needed] nonetheless many years later Stravinsky could still pride himself in never having been topped in the matter of succès de scandale.[citation needed]
The ragtime contained in Parade would later be adapted for piano solo and attained considerable success as a separate piano piece.[citation needed] The finale is ""a rapid ragtime dance in which the whole cast [makes] a last desperate attempt to lure the audience in to see their show"".[12]
The premiere of the ballet resulted in a number of scandals. One faction of the audience booed, hissed, and was very unruly, nearly causing a riot before they were drowned out by enthusiastic applause.[13] Many of their objections were focused on Picasso's cubist design, which was met with cries of ""sale boche.""[14]
According to the painter Gabriel Fournier, one of the most memorable scandals was an altercation between Cocteau, Satie, and music critic Jean Poueigh, who gave Parade an unfavorable review.[citation needed] Satie had written a postcard to the critic which read, ""Monsieur et cher ami – vous êtes un cul, un cul sans musique! Signé Erik Satie"" (""Sir and dear friend – you are an arse, an arse without music! Signed, Erik Satie.""). The critic sued Satie, and at the trial, Cocteau was arrested and beaten by police for repeatedly yelling ""arse"" in the courtroom. Satie was given a sentence of eight days in jail.[15][16]

Legacy[edit]
In 2013, Dale Eisinger of Complex ranked Parade the 20th best work of performance art in history, writing, ""Though there had been collaboration on ballets and operas previously, none had broken free of traditional notions of the forms quite like this group of artists did in the early 20th century.""[17]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Pas de légumes is a ballet created in 1982 with choreography by Frederick Ashton, to the music of Rossini arranged by John Dalby.[1]
The ballet originated as part of a 1979 EMI film Stories from a Flying Trunk, directed by Christine Edzard and produced by Richard B Goodwin, and adapted from Hans Christian Andersen's folk tales (this one being Little Ida’s Flowers).[2] A mock-heroic episode in the film where a potato, the lowest of the vegetables, fulfils his ambition to dance with a gorgeous princess is replaced on stage by a traditional pas de deux for a fairytale prince and princess.[3]
The music is taken from the operas Mosè in Egitto, Otello, and Le siège de Corinthe by Rossini. The title is a pun on the departure of Covent Garden flower, fruit and vegetable market from its traditional site in 1978 ('Vegetable step' – 'No vegetables'). (The Royal Ballet's home was the adjacent Royal Opera House.)[1]
In the original film, the vegetables were played by dancers of the Royal Ballet. The ballet Pas de légumes was first performed by Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet at Sadler's Wells Theatre, on 20 May 1982 with the extravagant costumes designed by Rostislav Doboujinsky.
The characters (given French names) are :

(Six) Oignons (onions)
Choufleur (cauliflower)
Choux rouge (red cabbage)
(Two) Petits pois (peas)
(Two) Artichaux (artichokes)
(Two) Broccolis
(Three) Laitues (lettuce)
(Two) Tomates (tomatoes)
(Three) Céleris (celery)
Le Prince et la Princesse des Légumes (Prince and Princess of Vegetables)
With the cast dressed as vegetables, Ashton's choreography is described as ""wittily graphic… at its best, the ballet shows the Chardinesque Ashton at work, making something out of nothing"".[1] He provides chaine turns ""that plump out the crinoline of Choux Rouge"" and a ""curly flourish of the arms that mimics the heads of celeris"".[3]

Grand Pas de Quatre is a ballet divertissement choreographed by Jules Perrot in 1845, on the suggestion of Benjamin Lumley, Director at Her Majesty's Theatre, to music composed by Cesare Pugni.
On the night it premiered in London (12 July 1845), it caused a sensation with the critics and the public alike. The reason for this was that it brought together, on one stage, the four greatest ballerinas of the time – in order of appearance, Lucile Grahn, Carlotta Grisi, Fanny Cerrito, and Marie Taglioni. (The fifth great Romantic ballerina of the time, Fanny Elssler, had been invited to take part but declined to do so; she was replaced by the young Lucile Grahn who accepted without hesitation.)[1]
Pas de Quatre captured the essence of the Romantic style as the ballerinas danced with demure lightness, delicacy, and poise. The steps demand that each area of classical ballet technique is executed. These areas include adagio movements, petite allegro, grand allegro, fast footwork, graceful changes of position, and the elegant and fluid arm movements that have become a signature element of Pas de Quatre. 
Each ballerina has an individual variation, which are performed in succession between an opening and finale that are danced by all the ballerinas together. These variations were choreographed for the ballerina premiering in each role, and were designed to display the best features of each.


History[edit]
The order of appearance of the ballerinas was done by age, from youngest to oldest, to squelch further confrontations between them.  The original cast of Pas de Quatre only danced four performances together; Queen Victoria and Prince Albert were in attendance on 17 July 1845, at the third of these four performances.[2]

Dolin's version[edit]
Nearly one hundred years later, in 1941, a new version of Pas de quatre was staged by choreographer Anton Dolin. The dancers he used were, in order of appearance: Nathalie Krassovska as Lucile Grahn, Mia Slavenska as Carlotta Grisi, Alexandra Danilova as Fanny Cerrito, and Alicia Markova as Marie Taglioni. Since then many ballet companies have performed the piece.
The sole and exclusive rights to perform Dolin's Pas de Quatre were left to Festival Ballet (now English National Ballet) dancers Belinda Wright and Jelko Yuresha, husband and wife. Wright and Dolin had known each other since Wright was a young dancer. She had won a Pavlova Award and caught Dolin's attention. Wright was a principal with Dolin's Festival Ballet after years with the Royal Ballet, and her husband Yuresha was a soloist. When Dolin died, his estate, run by his nephew Phillip, bestowed the rights to Pas de Quatre to Wright and Yuresha. Dolin's Pas de Quatre may not be staged, performed, produced or recorded without their permission and their doing the staging.[3]

The music[edit]
The original music was composed by Cesare Pugni but only used for the four performances in July 1845 at Her Majesty's Theatre with the great ballerinas Grahn, Grisi, Cerrito and Taglioni. No further performance took place in the next decades.
The publisher Julien issued Pugni's piano version immediately following the sussessful premiere.[4] Pugni's autograph orchestral score is preserved in the archives of the Bibliothèque Nationale de France.[5] Nevertheless, the new choreography of Anton Dolin made use of an orchestral arrangement prepared by composer Leighton Lucas from the original piano score.[6] Since then several other composers created orchestral versions from the piano score of Cesare Pugni, like William McDermott, Daniel Stirn or Peter March.

The Path of Thunder is a ballet in three acts with libretto by Yuri Slonimsky, music by Gara Garayev and choreography by Konstantin Sergeyev. Inspired by the 1948 eponymous novel of Peter Abrahams, the ballet tells the story of a forbidden love  between a black teacher and a white girl in 1940s Apartheid South Africa. The ballet premiered at the Mariinsky Theatre (called S. M. Kirov Leningrad State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet at the time) in Saint Petersburg (Leningrad at that time). Garayev used a soft, melodic music, which turns lyrical and passionate in the love scene, while the conflict with the girl's father and the other whites is accompanied by harsh, dissonant music. The lovers die in the course of conflict, but the people rise up against the racial prejudices towards them, leading themselves to the Path of Thunder, the way of liberation.
Many other versions of the ballet have been staged throughout the former Soviet Union, and in 1967 it won the Lenin Prize.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Les Patineurs (The Skaters) is a ballet choreographed by Frederick Ashton to music composed by Giacomo Meyerbeer and arranged by Constant Lambert. With scenery and costumes designed by William Chappell, it was first presented by the Vic-Wells Ballet at the Sadler's Wells Theatre, London, on 16 February 1937.[1] It has been called ""a paradigm of an Ashton ballet, perfectly crafted with a complex structure beneath the effervescent surface.""[2]


Synopsis[edit]
The ballet, in one act, depicts a Victorian skating party that takes place on a frozen pond on a winter's evening. A semicircle of arched trellises painted white separates the pond from the snowy woods behind. Suspended above are colourful Chinese lanterns, shedding light on the white canvas stage covering, simulating ice, and dimly illuminating the dark trees silhouetted against the starry night sky. The first skaters to enter are four couples dressed in matching brown jackets. They are soon joined by others: two girls wearing blue jackets and bonnets, two girls wearing red jackets and bonnets, a girl and boy dressed all in white, and a lone boy wearing blue. This happy group of young people dance together in various combinations, gliding and leaping and spinning across the ice until snow begins to fall and the single boy is finally left alone, whirling like a top in the middle of the pond.

Original cast[edit]
With a cast of only fifteen, Les Patineurs is a ballet in divertissement form rather than a story ballet: the dances simply proceed in sequence from beginning to end, with no narrative development. At the premiere, the principal dancers, the White Couple, were Margot Fonteyn and Robert Helpmann. The Blue Girls were Mary Honer and Elizabeth Miller; the Red Girls were June Brae and Pamela May; and Harold Turner was the Blue Boy, the virtuoso soloist in the group. The Brown Girls were Gwenyth Matthews, Joy Newton, Peggy Mellus, and Wenda Horsburgh, who were partnered by Richard Ellis, Leslie Edwards, Michael Somes, and Paul Raymond as the Brown Boys.[3]

Divertissements[edit]
The sequence of the divertissements, which takes about twenty-five minutes to perform, is as follows: entrée and pas de huit (Brown Couples), pas de patineurs (Blue Girls and Brown Couples), pas seul (Blue Boy), pas de deux (White Couple), ensemble, de suite par groupe (entire cast), pas de trois (Blue Boy and Blue Girls), pas de deux filles (Red Girls), pas de six (Brown Boys and Red Girls), pas de deux filles (Blue Girls), and finale (entire cast).
Despite the presence of Fonteyn and Helpmann in the romantic pas de deux for the White Couple, the true star of the ballet was Harold Turner as the Blue Boy. Ashton's main aim in creating Les Patineurs was to create a dazzling showpiece that would rival the popularity of works presented in London by Colonel de Basil's Ballets Russes the previous summer. In Turner, he had an unusually gifted dancer, and he took full advantage of his technical prowess. The Blue Boy is an exceptionally difficult role to perform, and the Blue Girls hardly less so. Further, the Brown Boys are given choreography more usually performed by soloists than members of the corps de ballet, as their bounding, buoyant dances require considerable elevation and stamina.

History[edit]
The inspiration for the work came from Constant Lambert, who was music director of the Vic-Wells Ballet during the 1930s and who exercised a major influence on the artistic as well as musical direction of the company.[4] During his research, he chanced upon an old program for an 1849 ballet by Paul Taglioni entitled Les Plaisirs de l'Hiver, ou, Les Patineurs, which gave him the idea for a new skating ballet. To create the score he chose vocal and dance numbers from two Meyerbeer operas, Le prophète and L'Étoile du Nord, and linked them into an irresistibly cheerful score which begins with the waltz which opens Act 2 of L'Étoile du Nord. Ninette de Valois was originally intended to be the choreographer, but Frederick Ashton heard Lambert playing the score on a piano and asked if he could take it on. He knew little about ice skating, but one of his dancers, Elizabeth Miller, did, and she demonstrated some movements and tricks for him. Transforming them into balletic vocabulary, he set out to create a ballet that would reveal the virtuosity of the burgeoning English ballet and win the public's approval.[5]
He succeeded beyond his highest hopes. After a triumphant premiere, Les Patineurs was performed in London every season from 1937 to 1968 (except 1960), in succession by the Vic-Wells Ballet, the Sadler's Wells Ballet, and the Royal Ballet. Touring companies performed it in many British cities from the 1950s to the 1980s. By 2011, it had been performed more than 350 times at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, alone. Productions have also been mounted in the United States, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, France, and Turkey. The production mounted for American Ballet Theatre in 1946 had new scenery and costumes designed by Cecil Beaton, which were universally considered an unfortunate departure from Chappell's original décor.

Recordings[edit]
Les Patineurs was one of the first ballets ever to be televised. The transmission by the BBC on 3 May 1937 from Alexandra Palace was not, however, recorded and preserved. Audio recordings of the score were made by Constant Lambert with the Sadler's Wells Orchestra in 1939 and later by many other conductors, including Jean Martinon, Charles Mackerras, Eugene Ormandy, Antal Doráti, Robert Irving, and Hugo Rignold. None of these well-known recordings is commercially available today. In December 2010, a video recording was made of a performance by the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, and issued on DVD by Opus Arte in 2011. Paul Murphy conducts the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, and the cast includes Steven McRae, Sarah Lamb, Rupert Pennefather, Laura Morera, Samantha Raine, Ryoichi Hirano, Liam Scarlett and Andrej Uspenski.

1907 ballet
Vaslav Nijinsky and Anna Pavlova, 1909
Le Pavillon d'Armide is a ballet in one act and three scenes choreographed by Michel Fokine with music by Nikolai Tcherepnin to a libretto by Alexandre Benois. It was inspired by the novella Omphale by Théophile Gautier.[1][2]

History[edit]
The work was first presented on 25 November 1907 at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, with staging and costumes by Alexandre Benois.  Principal dancers were Anna Pavlova in the role of Armida, Vaslav Nijinsky as her slave, and Pavel Gerdt as the Vicomte René de Beaugency and Rozai as the Clown.[2]
Other dancers included young Lydia Kyasht, Lubov Tchernicheva, and Tamara Karsavina.[2]
On 19 May 1909, the ballet was presented by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes at the Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris. The role of Armida was danced by Vera Karalli, the Vicomte de Beaugency by Mikhail Mordkin, and the Slave by Nijinsky.[3]  As the first ballet presented in Paris by Diaghilev, its success was due in part to its French theme. The 1909 season also included works based on Russian folklore which also met with public approval.[4]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The ""pas du songe"" in La Péri
La Péri is a fantastic ballet choreographed by Jean Coralli (1779-1854) to music composed by Friedrich Burgmüller. With a  scenario devised by Théophile Gautier and Coralli, scenery designed by Charles Séchan, Jules Diéterle, Édouard Desplechin, Humanité Philastre, and Charles Cambon, and costumes designed by Paul Lorimer and Hippolyte d'Orshwiller, it was first presented by the Paris Opera Ballet at the Académie Royale de Musique on 17 July 1843.[1]


Scenario[edit]
The ballet, in two acts, three scenes, had a typically Romantic plot dealing with a mortal's love for a supernatural being. Gautier's scenario was inspired by his attraction to the Orient and was devised for his favorite ballerina, Carlotta Grisi, in the guise of a Persian fairy.[2] She appears to the wealthy and world-weary Sultan Achmet, danced by Lucien Petipa, in one of his opium dreams, and he falls in love with her. To test his love, she takes the form of a runaway slave, Leila. Achmet is imprisoned for refusing to surrender her to her owner, but in an apotheosis the walls of his prison vanish and he is seen entering paradise with the Péri.[3]

Choreography[edit]
Coralli's choreography provided Grisi with two striking dances: a pas de songe that culminated in her daring leap from a six-foot-high platform into her partner's arms,[4] and a pas d'abeille, a decorous striptease prompted by the invasion of an imaginary bee. The ballet's immediate success did much to revive Grisi's flagging reputation. It was soon produced on ballet stages in theaters all over Europe.[5]

Historical note[edit]
French composer Paul Dukas (1865-1935) wrote a ""poème dansé"" entitled La Péri in 1911 that was first choreographed by Ivan Clustine in 1912 and that has since been choreographed in many versions by other choreographers, including Frederick Ashton, Serge Lifar, and George Skibine. None of them has any connection to Coralli's ballet set to the Burgmüller score.[6]

1912 ballet by Paul Dukas
This article is about Dukas' 1912 ballet music. For Burgmüller's 1843 ballet music of the same title, see La Péri (Burgmüller).
Set by René Piot, 1921.
La Péri (English: The Peri)[a] is a 1912 ballet in one act by French composer Paul Dukas, originally choreographed by Ivan Clustine and first performed in Paris, about Iskender (the name of Alexander the Great in Persian) searching for immortality and his encounter with a mythological Peri.  It was premiered on April 22, 1912.


Synopsis[edit]
At the end of his days of youth, the Magi having observed that his star had faded, Iskender travels throughout Iran in search of the Flower of Immortality. After three years of looking and wandering, he finally arrives at the Ends of the Earth, a place of utmost tranquility and calm. Iskender finds a temple to Ormuzd, and on its steps is a Peri. With a star flashing above her head and a lute in one hand, the Peri carries the Flower of Immortality, a lotus decorated with emeralds, in the other.
Later, as the Peri is sleeping, Iskender steals the Flower, careful to avoid making noise so that she does not wake up. Immediately the Flower sparkles brightly in his hands, and when the Peri wakes up, she strikes her hands against each other and lets out a great cry, because without the Flower she cannot enter into the presence of the light of Ormuzd. Upon this realization, Iskender delights at the power he now seemingly has over the Peri.
While in his hand, however, the Flower is transformed by Ormuzd to Iskender’s earthly and material desires. This is a sign to the Peri that possession of the Flower is not intended for Iskender, and so she performs a dance, gradually coming closer and closer until she is able to wrest the Flower from him. As the Peri slowly disappears in the light and returns to Paradise, Iskender realizes with calmness that he has been stranded and left to die.

Music[edit]
The original music to La Péri was written in 1911 by Paul Dukas as a Poème dansé en un tableau (""dance poem in one scene""), his last published work. Although not as well known as his famous symphonic poem The Sorcerer's Apprentice, the ballet has been considered to be one of his most mature and skilled pieces. The music's style can best be described as a mixture of Romantic tonal harmony and orchestration techniques with Impressionism, and is distinctly French. The ballet itself is preceded by a brilliant fanfare that uses the orchestra's brass section, and which is often performed separately.
Dukas scored La Péri for one piccolo (doubling third flute), two flutes, two oboes, one English horn, two clarinets in A, one bass clarinet in B flat, three bassoons; four horns in F, three trumpets in C, three trombones, one tuba; a percussion section that includes timpani, bass drum, snare drum, cymbals, triangle, tambourine and xylophone; one celesta; two harps and strings.

Performances[edit]
Sketches for Iskender and the Peri's costumes by Léon Bakst, 1922 and 1911.
Dukas had been commissioned to write the music for the Ballets Russes with designs by Léon Bakst, with Natalia Trouhanova as the Peri and Vaslav Nijinsky as Iskender. However, because Serge Diaghilev did not feel that Trouhanova was enough of a skilled dancer to be a partner to Nijinsky, the production was cancelled.

Natacha Trouhanova and Alfred Bekefi, 1912.
Trouhanova eventually commissioned Ivan Clustine to choreograph the music, and the work was premiered at the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris, on April 22, 1912, with Trouhanova in the title role, Alfred Bekefi as Iskender, designs by René Piot. The Concerts Lamoureux were conducted by the composer, and the other ballets on the programme (also all conducted by their composer) were Istar, La Tragédie de Salomé, and Adélaïde ou le langage des fleurs.[1]
The ballet entered the Paris Opera's repertoire in 1921, with Anna Pavlova and Hubert Stowitts dancing as the Peri and Iskender and designs by René Piot, and Philippe Gaubert conducting.
The ballet was performed in 1931 by the Ballet Rambert at the Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate in London, to choreography by Frederick Ashton and costume design by William Chappell. Ashton himself danced the role of Iskender, with ballerina Alicia Markova as the Peri. This production was short-lived, lasting only until 1932, but the same company performed the ballet again in 1938 to choreography by Frank Staff, and Ashton in 1956 designed a new version for The Royal Ballet. In this latter version, the two roles were played by Margot Fonteyn and Michael Somes with scenic design by Ivon Hitchens and costume design by André Lavasseur. In Britain it has also been performed at the Lyric Theatre Hammersmith and the Palace Theatre, Manchester.
Vladimir Malakhov staged a production of the ballet for the Staatsballett Berlin in 2010.[2][3] In 2012 Ivan Putrov used the score to choreograph his first major creation for the stage, at Sadler's Wells Theatre, entitled Ithaca.[4]
Though not common, excerpts from the ballet are still sometimes performed in student competitions.[5]

La Perle (en. The Pearl) (ru. «Жемчужина» or «Прелестная жемчужина»; Zhemchuzhina or Prelestnaya Zhemchuzhina) (en. Pearl or Pretty Pearl) is a ballet-divertissement in one act, with libretto and choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Riccardo Drigo.[1]


History[edit]
La Perle was created as a pièce d'occasion for a lavish gala given at the Bolshoi Theatre of Moscow in celebration of the coronation of Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra Fydorovna. The ballet had its premiere after a performance of scenes from Mikhail Glinka's opera A Life for the Tsar on 29 May [O.S. 17 May] 1896.[1][2] The original cast of La Perle featured the highest ranking dancers from the St. Petersburg and Moscow Imperial theatres.
While the ballet was in the early stages of production, a list of potential dancers for inclusion in the cast was created for review by a committee responsible for the coronation and its subsequent celebrations. Among those chosen for consideration in the principal roles was Nicholas II's former mistress, the ballerina Mathilde Kschessinskaya. In light of the history between Kschessinskaya and the new Emperor, his mother the Dowager Empress Marie Fyodorovna demanded that the ballerina be removed from the cast, as it would be considered scandalous for Kschessinskaya to perform in front of the Emperor's new wife, the Empress Alexandra. When Kschessinskaya learned of this, she appealed to the Emperor's uncle, the Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich, whose influence reinstated the ballerina in the cast in spite of the fact that at this point the Ballet Master Petipa and the composer Drigo had completed all of the choreography and music. Petipa became extremely frustrated when he learned that he and Drigo were nonetheless required to compose a number for Kschessinskaya, which took the form of a classical pas de deux for a new character dubbed ""La Perle jaune"" (the Yellow Pearl) and her suitor, performed by the danseur Nikolai Legat.[3][4]
La Perle was later transferred to the regular repertory of the Imperial Ballet, where it was first performed on 15 February [O.S. 3 February] 1898 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg. Marius Petipa would revive the ballet on only one occasion for a gala performance given at Petergof in 1900.[5] La Perle was performed often throughout the 1900s and was given its final performance in 1910.

Music[edit]
Riccardo Drigo's score featured an off-stage chorus and a large orchestra consisting of nearly 100 musicians. Contemporary critics praised the score for its rich melodic content and orchestration.[4] Drigo would later admit in his memoirs that he found it challenging to compose the many solo variations for the ballerinas while still maintaining variety.[4]
The Russian pedagogue Konstantin Sergeyev utilized pieces from Drigo's score for La Perle for his class concert for the Vaganova Academy titled School of Classical Dance (or From Landé to Vaganova) (ru. «Школа классического танца (От Ланде до Вагановой)»).

Synopsis[edit]
Marius Petipa's libretto was based on the danced tableau La Pérégrina: Ballet de la Reine from Verdi's opera Don Carlos. The scene was omitted before the premiere of the opera, and would have been choreographed by Petipa's brother Lucien.[6]
La Perle is set in a colossal subterranean grotto deep in the sea, where the White Pearl resides with her sister pearls of differing colors. The Genie of the Earth descends to the ocean floor in an attempt to abduct the White Pearl as an adornment for his crown. The King of the Corals comes the White Pearl's aid by causing a battle between the elements of the earth and of the sea. The Genie of the Earth succeeds in capturing the White Pearl, and the King of the Corals thereupon orders all of the ocean denizens to salute the Genie of the Earth side by side with the White Pearl. In an apotheosis, the Triumph of Amphitrite and Poseidon is depicted.[2][7]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Les petits riens (French for ""The Little Nothings"") is a ballet in one act and three tableaux by Jean-Georges Noverre, with music by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and other unknown composers, first performed at the Academie Royale de Musique in Paris on 11 June 1778. The three tableaux are described in the Journal de Paris:[1]

l' Amour pris au filet et mis en cage. ""Love caught in a net and put in a cage"", performed by Mme Guimard, Auguste Vestris and a young child.
Jeu de Colin-Maillard. The story of Jean Colin-Maillard was a legend about a warrior who fought on even with his eyes poked out. His name is the French word for the game Blind man's buff. The main role in this scene was performed by Jean Dauberval. Such playful scenery usually had flirtatious connotations, which is famously depicted by Fragonard in his painting Le Collin-Maillard.
Espieglerie de l'Amour. ""Playfulness of love"" is a pastoral scene about a woman, played by Mlle Asselin, disguised as a male shepherd. Two other shepherdesses, performed by Mlles Guimard and Allard, fall in love with the shepherd. Finally, to disenchant the two shepherdesses the imposter ends up revealing her breasts to them.
While Mozart was staying in Paris, Noverre asked him to compose a new score for a ballet that he had created in Vienna in 1767. The ballet was to be danced as an interlude in the new opera Le finte gemelle [it; es] (1771) by Niccolò Piccinni.[2] The opera was a flop and closed after four performances. Although the ballet music was well-received,[1] Mozart was not credited with it, and he was at the time little known in Paris.
The score, catalogued as K. Anh. 10/299b, was thought lost, but it was rediscovered in the Paris Opera's archives in the late 19th century[2] and has since entered both the ballet and symphonic repertoire. The Passepied (nr. 11) in D major is reminiscent of the first movement of Tchaikovsky's Souvenir de Florence, Op. 70; a D minor version of the melody appears in bars 5 and 6. The motive derived from this is used throughout the piece.

1911 ballet by Igor Stravinsky

Petrushka (French: Pétrouchka; Russian: Петрушка) is a ballet by Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1911 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Michel Fokine and stage designs and costumes by Alexandre Benois, who assisted Stravinsky with the libretto. The ballet premiered at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 June 1911 with Vaslav Nijinsky as Petrushka, Tamara Karsavina as the lead ballerina, Alexander Orlov as the Moor, and Enrico Cecchetti the charlatan.[1]
Petrushka tells the story of the loves and jealousies of three puppets. The three are brought to life by the Charlatan during the 1830 Shrovetide Fair (Maslenitsa) in Saint Petersburg. Petrushka loves the Ballerina, but she rejects him. She prefers the Moor. Petrushka is angry and hurt, and challenges the Moor. The Moor kills him with his scimitar. Petrushka's ghost rises above the puppet theatre as night falls. He shakes his fist at the Charlatan, then collapses in a second death.
Petrushka brings music, dance, and design together in a unified whole. It is one of the most popular of the Ballets Russes productions. It is usually performed today using the original designs and choreography. Grace Robert wrote in 1946, ""Although more than thirty years have elapsed since Petrushka was first performed, its position as one of the greatest ballets remains unassailed. Its perfect fusion of music, choreography, and décor and its theme—the timeless tragedy of the human spirit—unite to make its appeal universal"".[2]


Russian puppets[edit]
Petrushka performance in a Russian village, 1908
Petrushka is a puppet. He is a character known across Europe under different names: Punch in England, Polichinelle in France, Pulcinella in Italy, Kasperle in Germany, and Petrushka in Russia. Whatever his name, he is a trickster, a rebel, and a wife beater. He enforces moral justice with a wooden club, speaks in a high-pitched, squeaky voice, and argues with the devil. His plays were formulaic and subversive. They repeated key scenes from one play to another. The plays usually ended with a dog, a policeman, or the devil dragging him away.[3]
Empress Anna Ivanovna brought marionettes to Russia in the 18th century. These puppets were an amusement for the aristocracy. Rod puppets were an Asian import. They performed religious plays, mostly at Christmas. Petrushka, however, was a hand puppet. He was loved by the common people. He performed in street theatres and other open air venues in small portable booths or behind screens that could be easily assembled and just as easily disassembled. After the Russian Revolution, Soviet authorities forced Petrushka indoors. They wanted to be better able to monitor his subversiveness.[3]

Composition[edit]
Igor Stravinsky with Vaslav Nijinsky in costume for Petrushka.
The gestation of Petrushka was not a straightforward matter. While completing The Firebird during the spring of 1910, Stravinsky had a ""vision"" of a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of The Rite of Spring.[4] Immediately following the stunning success of The Firebird in June 1910, Diaghilev approached Stravinsky about a new ballet; the composer proposed the Rite theme. Diaghilev accepted in principle and suggested that the premiere might take place during the Paris season of the Ballets Russes during the spring of 1912.
At the end of September 1910, Diaghilev went to visit Stravinsky in Clarens, Switzerland, where he was living at the time. Expecting to discuss the new ballet, Diaghilev was astonished to find Stravinsky hard at work on a totally different project. Stravinsky, it seems, had had another vision: ""I saw a man in evening dress, with long hair, the musician or poet of the romantic tradition. He placed several heteroclite objects on the keyboard and rolled them up and down. At this the orchestra exploded with the most vehement protestations – hammer blows, in fact …""[5]
Later, Stravinsky wrote: ""[i]n composing the music, I had in my mind a distinct picture of a puppet, suddenly endowed with life, exasperating the patience of the orchestra with diabolical cascades of arpeggios. The orchestra in turn retaliates with menacing trumpet blasts.""[6] Although Stravinsky had conceived the music as a pure concert work—a Konzertstück, Diaghilev immediately realized its theatrical potential. The notion of a puppet put Diaghilev in mind of Petrushka, the Russian version of Punch and Judy puppetry that had formed a traditional part of the pre-Lenten Carnival festivities in 1830s St. Petersburg.
Stravinsky composed the music during the winter of 1910–11 for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. It was premièred in Paris at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 13 June 1911 the Orchestre Colonne under conductor Pierre Monteux, with choreography by Michel Fokine and sets by Alexandre Benois. The title role was danced by Vaslav Nijinsky.[7] The work is characterized by the so-called Petrushka chord (consisting of C major and F♯ major triads played together), a bitonality device heralding the appearance of the main character.

Libretto and story[edit]
The Shrovetide Fair by Benois
While the original idea was Stravinsky's, Alexandre Benois provided the ethnographic details of the Shrovetide Fair and the traditions of the Russian puppet theater. And although Petrushka is frequently cited as an example of the complete integration of libretto, music, choreography, and scenic design, Stravinsky had composed significant portions of the music (chiefly the second tableau) before Benois became involved with the project.

First tableau: The Shrovetide Fair[edit]
Petrushka begins with a festive orchestral introduction based, in part, on historical Russian street-hawkers' cries.[8] The curtain rises to reveal St. Petersburg's Admiralty Square during the 1830s. The stage set (also by Benois) depicts several hucksters' booths, a ferris-wheel, a carousel, and (upstage center) a puppet theater. A crowd has gathered for the Shrovetide Fair (known as Maslenitsa), the carnival (analogous to Mardi Gras) preceding Lent.
In Fokine's original choreography, a group of Drunken Revelers emerges from the crowd, dancing to Stravinsky's adaptation of the folk-tune ""Song of the Volochobniki"" (""Dalalin' Dalalin'"" from Rimsky-Korsakov Op. 24 No. 47).[8]

Suddenly, the festive music is interrupted by strident brass announcing the appearance of the Master of Ceremonies on the balcony of his booth. The equivalent of a carnival ""barker"", he boasts of the attractions to be seen within. 
The squeaks of a street-organ are heard (clarinets and flutes) as an Organ-Grinder and Dancing Girl emerge from the crowd, which at first pays little attention as the barker continues to shout. The Dancer moves downstage and begins to dance to another Russian folk-song, ""Toward Evening, in Rainy Autumn"",[8] while playing the triangle.
At the other end of the stage, a second Dancing Girl appears, accompanied by a music box (suggested in the orchestra by the celesta). The two Dancing Girls compete for the crowd's attention to the strains of a ribald French music-hall song about a woman with a wooden leg: ""Une Jambe de bois"".[8] Both tunes are repeated.

The Drunken Revelers return (again to the ""Song of the Volochobniki"") interrupted several times by the Barker's boasts. The street-hawkers' cries of the very opening are heard once more.
Suddenly, two drummers summon the crowd to the puppet theater with deafening drumrolls. The Magician (sometimes called the ""Charlatan"") appears to mystical groans from the bassoon and contrabassoon. When he has everyone's attention, he produces a flute and begins to play a long, improvisatory melody. The curtain of the puppet theater rises to reveal three puppets hanging on the wall: the Moor, the Ballerina, and Petrushka. When the Magician touches them with his flute (to chirps in the orchestra), they seem to awaken.
The astonished crowd watches as, with a wave of the Magician's hand, the three puppets begin a vigorous Russian Dance (based on two more Russian folk-tunes: ""A Linden Tree Is in the Field"" and ""Song for St. John's Eve"").[8]

In Fokine's choreography, they first begin to move their feet (while still hanging on the wall), then burst forth from the puppet theater into the midst of the crowd. The Moor (resplendent in turban and exaggerated pantaloons) is swashbuckling. The Ballerina dances perpetually en pointe. Petrushka, on the other hand, is wooden and awkward. It becomes apparent Petrushka loves the Ballerina; but she has eyes only for the Moor. The Magician calls the dance to a halt; the curtain falls rapidly.

Petrushka's Room by Alexandre Benois
Second tableau: Petrushka's Room[edit]
Although Petrushka's room is inside the puppet theater, the Benois design is fantastical, portraying the night sky with stars and a half-moon; abstract icebergs (or snow-capped mountains), and a prominent portrait of the Magician.
Drumrolls announce the beginning of the second tableau. Without an Introduction, the music begins menacingly. ""A foot kicks him onstage; Petrushka falls...""[9]
As Petrushka gradually pulls himself together, we hear a strange arpeggio in the clarinets: this is the famous ""Petrushka chord"" (consisting of juxtaposed triads of C major and F♯ major). Petrushka gets to his feet (although shakily) to the accompaniment of waves of arpeggios from the piano (revealing the music's origins in Stravinsky's Konzertstück). The ""Petrushka Chord"" returns, now violently scored for trumpets, marked in the score ""Petrushka's Curses"", directed at the portrait of the Magician.
The music turns lyrical as Petrushka falls to his knees and mimes (in turn) his self-pity, love for the Ballerina, and hatred of the Magician.
The Ballerina (still en pointe) sneaks into Petrushka's room, at first unnoticed. As soon as Petrushka sees her, he begins a manic, athletic display of leaps and frantic gestures (although he was barely able to stand before she arrived). Frightened by his exuberance, the Ballerina flees. Petrushka falls to the floor to the mocking of the clarinets.
Another passage of arpeggios for piano grows into a second round of curses directed at the Magician, again represented musically by the ""Petrushka Chord"", this time scored for full orchestra.[9]
For just a moment, Petrushka peers out of his room at the crowd assembled in Admiralty Square (Stravinsky provides a brief reference to the ""crowd music"" of the first tableau). Then, Petrushka collapses as we hear a taunting reprise of the clarinets playing the ""Petrushka Chord"", followed by an odd trumpet call signalling ""blackout, curtain.""[9]

The Moor's Room by Benois
Third tableau: The Moor's Room[edit]
As before, drumrolls link the third tableau to its predecessor (in the 1911 score, Stravinsky directs that this drumroll should be omitted in concert performance). In sharp contrast to the darkness of Petrushka's Room, the brilliant colors of the Benois design for the Moor's Room evoke a romanticized desert: palm trees, exotic flowers, sand.
In Fokine's choreography, the Moor reclines on a divan playing with a coconut. He then jumps to his feet and attempts to cut it with his scimitar. When he fails he believes that the coconut must be a god and proceeds to pray to it.
The Charlatan places the Ballerina in the Moor's room. The Ballerina is attracted to the Moor's handsome appearance. She plays a saucy tune on a toy trumpet (represented by a cornet in the original 1911 orchestration) and then dances with the Moor in a waltz (the themes taken from Joseph Lanner's Op. 165 No. 1 and Op. 200 No. 1).[10]
Petrushka finally breaks free from his cell; he interrupts the seduction of the Ballerina. Petrushka attacks the Moor but soon realizes he is too small and weak. The Moor beats Petrushka. The ballerina faints. The clown-puppet flees for his life, with the Moor chasing him, and escapes from the room.

Fourth tableau: The Shrovetide Fair (Toward Evening)[edit]
The fourth and final scene returns to the carnival. Some time has passed; it is now early evening. The orchestra introduces a chain of colourful dances as a series of apparently unrelated characters come and go about the stage as snow begins to fall. The first and most prominent is the Wet-Nurses' Dance, performed to the tune of the folk song ""Down the Petersky Road"". Then comes a peasant with his dancing bear, followed in turn by a group of a gypsies, coachmen and grooms and masqueraders.
As the merrymaking reaches its peak, a cry is heard from the puppet-theater. Petrushka suddenly runs across the scene, followed by the Moor in hot pursuit brandishing his sword, and the terrified Ballerina chasing after the Moor, fearful of what he might do. The crowd is horrified when the Moor catches up with Petrushka and slays him with a single stroke of his blade.
The police question the Charlatan. The Charlatan seeks to restore calm by holding the ""corpse"" above his head and shaking it to remind everyone that Petrushka is but a puppet.
As night falls and the crowd disperses, the Charlatan leaves, carrying Petrushka's limp body. All of a sudden, Petrushka's ghost appears on the roof of the little theatre, his cry now in the form of angry defiance. Petrushka's spirit thumbs its nose at his tormentor from beyond the wood and straw of his carcass.
Now completely alone, the Charlatan is terrified to see the leering ghost of Petrushka. He runs away while allowing himself a single frightened glance over his shoulder. The scene is hushed, leaving the audience to wonder who is ""real"" and who is not.[11]

Other versions[edit]
During rehearsals for the 1911 premiere, Stravinsky and other pianists including Russian composer Nikolai Tcherepnin used a piano four-hand version of the score. This has never been published, although Paul Jacobs and Ursula Oppens, among other pianists, have played it in concert.[12]
In 1921, Stravinsky created a virtuosic and celebrated piano arrangement for Arthur Rubinstein, Trois mouvements de Petrouchka, which the composer admitted he could not play himself, for want of adequate left-hand technique.
Herbert Stothart, who composed the score for The Wizard of Oz, was visited by Stravinsky at MGM in 1936.[13] Stravinsky gave Stothart a personal, signed copy of Petrushka. As the main characters in the film run through the Deadly Poppy Field, the opening to the fourth tableau can be heard briefly.[citation needed]
In 1946, he thinned the ballet's scoring, in part because the original was not covered everywhere by copyright. The rapid continuous timpani and snare-drum notes that link each scene, optional in 1911, are compulsory in this version, which was published in 1947. The Ballerina's tune is assigned to a trumpet in 1946 in place of a cornet, and the 1946 version provides an optional fff (fortississimo) near the piano conclusion. Stravinsky also removed some difficult metric modulations in the first tableau.
Separately Stravinsky created a suite for concert performance, an almost complete version of the ballet but cutting the last three sections.
In 1956, an animated version of the ballet appeared as part of NBC's Sol Hurok Music Hour. It was personally conducted by Stravinsky himself and was the first such collaboration. Directed by animator John David Wilson with Fine Arts Films, it has been noted as the first animated special ever to air on television.
Frank Zappa's 1960's iteration of his band the Mothers of Invention, would frequently quote Petrushka either as a standalone performance or during their longer performances of the song King Kong. 
In 1988, Maddalena Fagandini directed a version of Petrushka along with The Sleeping Beauty (Tchaikovsky), The Nutcracker (and the Mouse King) (Tchaikovsky) and Coppélia (Delibes) in the BBC puppet film Musical Tales which was released in VHS.
Basil Twist debuted his puppetry version of Petrushka at Lincoln Center in 2001; it was performed as well at New York City Center's 2009 Fall for Dance Festival.
A full transcription of the 1911 version for symphonic wind ensemble in the original key was made by Don Patterson.
Themes from Petrushka are played on banjo in the track ""Russian Folk Themes and Yodel"" on Pete Seeger's album Goofing-Off Suite, released in 1955 on Folkways Records.
In the 2022 film Goodbye, Petrushka, Petrushka is a major plot element.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


For other uses, see Pharaoh's Daughter (disambiguation).

The Pharaoh's Daughter (Russian: Дочь фараона, French: La Fille du pharaon), is a ballet choreographed by Marius Petipa to music by Cesare Pugni. The libretto was a collaboration between Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and Petipa from Théophile Gautier's Le Roman de la momie. It was first presented by the Imperial Ballet at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, in St. Petersburg, Russia, on 18 January (30 January) 1862, with the design by A. Roller, G. Wagner (scenery), Kelwer and Stolyakov (costumes).
The principal dancers at the opening night were Carolina Rosati (Mummy/Aspicia), Nicholas Goltz (Pharaoh), Marius Petipa (Ta-Hor), Timofey Stoukolkin as John Bull, Lubov Radina (Ramzaya), Felix Kschessinskiy (King of Nubia), and Lev Ivanov (Fisherman). For Petipa it was the last role: he has finished his career as a dancer; he became ballet master.
The Sergeyev Collection, which is part of the Harvard University Theatre Collection, contains choreographic notations of the Imperial Ballet's production of The Pharaoh's Daughter, created circa 1905. The notations document the choreography and mise-en-scène as staged by Marius Petipa for his last revival of 1898, which was mounted especially for the benefit performance of Mathilde Kschessinskaya.


Plot[edit]
An English lord and John Bull,  his servant, and a guide shelter from a sandstorm in a pyramid during an African safari. They start to become noisy, but the guide asks them to quiet down in respect for the Pharaoh's daughter who is lying in a coffin somewhere in the pyramid. So, to pass the time, the guide gives out opium. As soon as the nobleman puffs the opium, weird things start to happen. The many other mummies in the pyramid start to come alive. Suddenly the Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia, comes alive and lays her hand over the nobleman's heart, and the nobleman is transported into the past. He becomes Ta-Hor, an ancient Egyptian man who saves Aspicia from a lion. Ta-Hor and Aspicia fall in love, but she is betrothed to the Nubian king. They run away together and the king chases them. Ta-Hor and Aspicia stop in a fishermen's inn to hide out, and the local fishermen ask them if they want to come on a fishing trip. Aspicia decides to stay behind. Then the Nubian king stops at the inn to rest and finds Aspicia who jumps into the Nile River to escape his guards.
At the bottom of the river, the Spirit of the Nile summons the great rivers of the world to dance for Aspicia, then he tells her that she must stay. When she hears this, she asks for one wish: to bring her back to land. When the fishermen and Ta-Hor arrive back on land, the Nubian king detains Ta-Hor and brings him back to the Pharaoh's palace to be punished for ""kidnapping"" the princess.
When Aspicia comes back to land, the fishermen bring her back to the palace.  She gets there in time to see Ta-Hor sentenced to death by a cobra bite.  She explains that if he dies, she dies, and reaches out for the snake to bite her.  The Pharaoh pulls her back and grants her permission to marry Ta-Hor, and the Nubian king leaves in a fit of rage, swearing revenge. Everyone starts to celebrate, but as the party reaches its peak, the opium dream ends and Ta-Hor is transformed back into the English lord. As they leave the pyramid, the nobleman looks back at Aspicia's coffin and remembers the love that they shared and still share.

History[edit]
The Pharaoh's Daughter  (La Fille du pharaon) was the first multi-act grand ballet Marius Petipa staged during his long career with the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The ballet was staged especially for the benefit performance of the Italian ballerina Carolina Rosati,  who performed the principal role of the Princess Aspicia. She danced opposite Marius Petipa, who portrayed Aspicia's hero and lover, Lord Wilson/Ta-Hor. The premiere on 30 January [O.S. 18 January] 1862 was an enormous success, and soon the ballet  became the most popular work in the repertoire of the Imperial Ballet. 
Marius Petipa staged The Pharaoh's Daughter while he was still serving as assistant ballet master to Arthur Saint-Léon, who from 1859 until 1869 served as Premier Maître de Ballet to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The success of The Pharaoh's Daughter earned for Petipa the position of second Maître de Ballet, a position he would hold until Saint-Léon's departure from Russia in 1869.
Petipa revived The Pharaoh's Daughter in 1885 and again in 1898. In 1905, Alexander Gorsky put on a modified production for the Imperial Bolshoi Ballet without Petipa's approval,[1] and the ballet continued to be performed until 1928. In 2000, it was revived in Pierre Lacotte's restaging for the Bolshoi Ballet, which Lacotte based partly on the Stepanov notation recording Petipa's final production and partly on the personal recollections of Russian dancers.[2] It has since become a regular part of the Bolshoi's repertory. In 2023 the Mariinsky Ballet premiered a historical production. This production is based on the Stepanov notations and other materials. It was staged by the choreographer Toni Candeloro in collaboration with notation interpreter Juan Bockamp. Set and costume designs where produced by Robert Perdizola.

Mathilde Kschessinskaya as the Princess Aspicia (1903)
It was also a production of the choreographic trend parallel to that of the grand opera in music, towards the ballet à grand spectacle, which lasted four hours and used different styles and techniques and a large number of people (about 400), with plots characterized by strong dramatic contrasts.
Marius Petipa changed the art of classical ballet by inserting divertissements, or displays of dance that were perhaps symbolic or loose importance to the story, as a display for dancers that were not the leads. This was important because, at the time, many foreign guest artists were being brought in and the Russian-trained, Russian-dancers were not being given the chance to display their own talents. Marius Petipa started putting these divertissements in all of his ballets (Swan Lake, La Bayadère, The Sleeping Beauty, etc.) and the divertissement itself became a technique used by many choreographers as a way to give dancers time to change costumes, shoes, or create a scene break.
The interest in Ancient Egypt at the time, inspired by recent archaeological finds, as well as Gautier's Le Roman de la momie,  gave Petipa the push to create The Pharaoh's Daughter. These interests and finds inspired a new wave of costuming, such as the newly shortened tutu being decorated with Egyptian jewelry and ornamentation. These decorations were meant to give the audience a better feel to the ballet and reflect Egyptian nationality. Some of these costumes could be considered racist, as the leads were dressed in beautiful, expensive costumes, where the Nationalistic dances could be covered in blackface. They were meant to inspire a feeling of Egyptian taste, but authenticity was often compromised for opulence and could be considered entirely offensive.
The ballet's literary source is Le Roman de la momie by Théophile Gautier, an exponent of literary exoticism which offered all sorts of romantic expedients: the passionate love story of the great Pharaoh's daughter and Tahoser set in a Biblical Egypt which, however, disappeared in the ballet, and the Gothic taste for gloomy corridors and dark tombs. What the ballet retains of Gautier's world is the sense of the fantastic which accompanies earthly passions. With an artifact from the past or a puff of opium – a familiar influence in the works and lives of contemporary artists such as De Quincey – allowed Gautier to add a brighter aura to his characters by setting them on the borderline between life and death from which all Egyptian art took nourishment.
So as not to overwhelm his readers with terror, Gautier frequently appeals to irony, which has an anticlimactic effect. Irony serves the same function in the ballet, for example in the moment when Lord Wilson, the quintessence of Englishness, impassively attempts to sketch the scene of the desert disturbed by the simoom, or when Aspicia, after rising from the sarcophagus, looks into a mirror and is pleased to find herself as pretty as she was a few millennia before.
The story called for an artist in the title role who had a special dramatic talent (as did Rosati), because of all the scenes of love, fear, and courage which culminate in Aspicia's attempt to cast herself onto a flower-basket hiding a snake, a classic gesture since Cleopatra's time. Twenty years later, Virginia Zucchi (less conventionally) portrayed an unusually humane princess, not as arrogant and voluptuous as that of her successor Mathilde Kschessinskaya who, on the other hand, made it more of a virtuoso role.
Petipa's penchant for folklore enhanced the dance of bayadères and the pageant of the rivers (from Guadalquivir to Neva), all dressed up in national costumes, but historical inaccuracy and the mixing of styles raised a few criticisms, especially in Moscow, in spite of the general taste for sets and costumes reinvented with a minimum of realism and a maximum of grandeur.

Piano Pieces is a ballet choreographed by Jerome Robbins to music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. The ballet was made for New York City Ballet's Tchaikovsky Festival, and premiered on June 11, 1981, at the New York State Theater.


Choreography[edit]
Piano Pieces is danced by seven principal dancers and a corps de ballet of six couples, all dressed in Russian style costumes.[1][2] The ballet starts with pieces for the ensemble, followed by solos and pas de deux performed by the principal dancers.[2] The full cast returns for the finale, with a male dancer leading the dancers.[1]
Author Amanda Vaill described it as ""a dance about the joy of dancing.""[3] Deborah Jowitt described that ""it's the patterns and choreographic ideas that create a sense of a village, not just the device of people watching others dance.""[1] Critic Jennifer Dunning wrote that it ""contains some of Robbins's favorite themes, among them playful Russian folk-dance moves, goofy sequences of jumps and a hint or two of competition.""[4]

Production[edit]
Piano Pieces was created for the New York City Ballet's Tchaikovsky Festival.[2] The festival was conceived by George Balanchine.[5] Robbins, however, was not interested in choreographing to Tchaikovsky's works.[1] He nevertheless choreographed three ballets for the festival.[5] He later recalled, ""Two months before the Tchaikovsky festival, I thought, I don't like Tchaikovsky... Why should I do Tchaikovsky? Because Mr. Balanchine wants me to do Tchaikovsky? But you don't necessarily have to enjoy doing something for it to be good.""[5]
Piano Pieces uses various piano pieces, including excerpts from The Seasons.[2] Robbins originally planned the ballet to be about a group of dancers rehearsing a fictitious ballet. However, once rehearsals began, he abandoned this idea, and changed the theme to be about the joy of dancing.""[3] While the dancers had many rehearsals, he enjoyed the experience more than he expected.[1] Stacy Caddell, who had a small role in the ballet, recalled, ""When we did Piano Pieces, it was hard, because Jerry would come in with Version A, B, C, D, E, F, G, up to J—like cut-and-paste.""[5] Piano Pieces is also the first ballet Robbins made on Maria Calegari.[1]
The costumes were designed by Ben Benson.[2] The lighting was designed by Ronald Bates.[6]

Performances[edit]
Piano Pieces premiered on June 12, 1981, at the New York State Theater.[5] The piano was played by Jerry Zimmerman.[2] Later at the festival, when some works had to be cancelled due to injuries, Piano Pieces was performed again.[3]

Critical reception[edit]
After the premiere, New York Times critic compared Piano Pieces to Dances at a Gathering, which is set to works by Frédéric Chopin, and commented, ""The differences between the two ballets are perhaps not as great as the difference between Chopin and Tchaikovsky. But choreographically, Mr. Robbins's interest in partnering reaches a new peak. Piano Pieces is a brilliant step forward in the art of the pas de deux.""[2]

Pictures at an Exhibition is a ballet choreographed by Alexei Ratmansky to Mussorgsky's eponymous score. The ballet premiered on October 2, 2014 at the David H. Koch Theater, danced by the New York City Ballet.


Production[edit]
Ratmansky's Pictures at an Exhibition is performed by five men and five women.[1] The original cast includes Wendy Whelan, who had created roles in every Ratmansky's works for the New York City Ballet at that point, and was scheduled to retire from ballet at the end of the season.[2][3]
The score by Mussorgsky is about a posthumous exhibition of works by Viktor Hartmann. However, Wassily Kandinsky's painting Color Study: Squares With Concentric Circles is projected on stage, designed by Wendall K. Harrington.[1] Adeline André designed the costumes.[4]
The Pacific Northwest Ballet made their debut in Pictures of an Exhibitions in 2017. Whelan stage the ballet for the company, though she had never staged a ballet before. She said she watched the video footage of the ballet repeatedly and spent hours everyday over a month to write down the steps.[3]

Reception[edit]
On the premiere, New York Times wrote that the ballet ""is surely the most casually diverse work Mr. Ratmansky has created, but it gathers unstoppable momentum.""[1] The Financial Times gave the ballet four stars, and commented that the ballet ""abounds in ballet quotations and commentary, yet its tone is not ironic.""[5]

Videography[edit]
In 2020, in response to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, the New York City Ballet released a 2017 video recording of excerpts of the ballet, featuring Peck, Mearns, Stafford, Garcia, Angle, Gordon, Sterling Hyltin, Claire Kretzschmar, Aaron Sanz and Andrew Veyette.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Hugh Laing and Nora Kaye in Pillar of Fire
Pillar of Fire is a 30-minute dramatic ballet choreographed by Antony Tudor to Arnold Schoenberg's Verklärte Nacht (Transfigured Night), Op. 4.


Performance history[edit]
The work was first produced by Ballet Theatre (now the American Ballet Theatre) at the Metropolitan Opera House on 8 April 1942. The opening-night cast included Nora Kaye as Hagar, Antony Tudor as the Young man, Hugh Laing as the Man in the house across the way, Lucia Chase as the Eldest Sister, Annabelle Lyon as the Youngest Sister, Maria Karnilova, Charles Dickson, Jan Davidson, John Kriza, Virginia Wilcox, Wallace Seibert, Jean Hunt, Barbara Fallis, Sono Osato, Rosella Hightower, Muriel Bentley, Jerome Robbins, Donald Saddler, Frank Hobi, Balina Razoumova, and Roszika Sabo.[1]

Synopsis[edit]
American Ballet Theatre describes it in full extensive detail in its archives.[2] The setting is a small country town in 1900 (perhaps in Schoenberg's Austria). Hagar, the middle of three sisters, whose elder sister is a spinster, foresees the same fate for herself. Hagar is surrounded on the one side by the prude and judging neighboring women of the small town, and on the other by licentious men and their hedonistic women. The man she unrequitedly loves seems to show preference for her flirtatious younger sister.
Hagar in desperation gives herself sexually to one of the licentious men, whom she definitely does not love, and who then immediately leaves her abandoned. Afterwards she is shunned by the prude and judging women and is totally distraught by what she has done. This resulting crisis, however, unites her with the one she really loves - the man she loves comes to her, and they dance together rapturously.
The ballet is set in the period around 1900 because it was then that Schoenberg composed its music Verklärte Nacht (""Transfigured Night""). The story plot is based on several traditional text versions - in some versions Hagar becomes pregnant before her true love finally comes to her.[2]

An actual performance[edit]
An actual American Ballet Theatre performance, together with spoken brief remarks by Antony Tudor, is available on YouTube.[3]

Legacy[edit]
This ballet was documented in Labanotation by the Dance Notation Bureau in 1982.[4]

Gilbert and Sullivan-inspired comic ballet

GilbertPremiere13 March 1951Sadler's Wells TheatreOriginal ballet companySadler's Wells BalletSettingPortsmouth, England and on board the H.M.S. Hot Cross BunGenreNeoclassical balletTypecomic ballet
Pineapple Poll is a Gilbert and Sullivan-inspired comic ballet, created by choreographer John Cranko with arranger Sir Charles Mackerras.  Pineapple Poll is based on ""The Bumboat Woman's Story"", one of W. S. Gilbert's Bab Ballads, written in 1870. The Gilbert and Sullivan opera H.M.S. Pinafore was also based, in part, on this story. For the ballet, Cranko expanded the story of the Bab Ballad and added a happy ending. All the music is arranged from Sullivan's music.
The piece premiered in 1951 at Sadler's Wells Theatre and was given many revivals internationally during the following decades. It remains in the repertoire of the Birmingham Royal Ballet. It has also been recorded many times.


Background[edit]
Mackerras and his family were Gilbert and Sullivan fans. As a youth, at the all-male St Aloysius College in Sydney, he played Kate in The Pirates of Penzance, Leila in Iolanthe and Ko-Ko in The Mikado.[1] In 1941–42, while at the NSW State Conservatorium of Music, he played the oboe for the J. C. Williamson Company during one of their Gilbert and Sullivan seasons. He was also a rehearsal pianist for the Kirsova Ballet company, where he became familiar with the successful ballets based on Offenbach, Strauss and Rossini music: Gaîté Parisienne, Le Beau Danube and La Boutique fantasque. He felt that a similar arrangement of the music of Sullivan would also be popular.[1]
He had to wait a decade until the copyright on Sullivan's music expired at the end of 1950. Meanwhile, Mackerras had moved to London, studied conducting in Prague and, in 1948, become assistant conductor and repetiteur for Sadler's Wells Opera.[1] Peggy van Praagh suggested that he work out the idea with the young choreographer John Cranko. Cranko expanded the plot of W. S. Gilbert's Bab Ballad ""The Bumboat Woman's Story"", in which the central character is named Poll Pineapple. The Gilbert and Sullivan opera H.M.S. Pinafore (especially its character Little Buttercup) was also based, in part, on this story. Cranko introduced new characters (Mrs Dimple) and gave Poll an admirer to enable a happy ending.[2] Mackerras arranged the score of Pineapple Poll from the Gilbert and Sullivan repertoire, as well as Sullivan's comic opera Cox and Box (written with F. C. Burnand), and Sullivan's Overture di Ballo. Music from all of the extant Gilbert and Sullivan operas is included, except for Utopia Limited and The Grand Duke.

Productions and recordings[edit]
Pineapple Poll premiered on 13 March 1951 at Sadler's Wells Theatre by the Sadler's Wells Ballet as part of the Festival of Britain. It was part of an evening of four Cranko ballets.[1][3] The production was designed by Osbert Lancaster, who later designed the 1971 D'Oyly Carte production of The Sorcerer.[2] The ballet was a critical and popular success Sadler's Wells also toured this in the US.[4] The ballet was later produced by the Borovansky Ballet in 1954, Covent Garden in 1959, National Ballet of Canada in 1959, the Joffrey Ballet at City Center in New York City in 1970, Noverre Ballet in 1972 and Oslo Ballet in 1975.[4][5] In recent years, the ballet has fallen out of the professional ballet repertory in the US, although there was a revival in 2004 by Spectrum Dance Theater of Seattle, with new choreography by Donald Byrd,[6] and it is sometimes played as an orchestral piece. The ballet is occasionally produced by amateur groups.[7] In the UK, it remains in the repertoire of the Birmingham Royal Ballet, with a run of performances in 2006 and 2007 and a tour, including to Sadler's Wells Theatre, in 2011.[8]
The score, or excerpts from it, has been recorded at least seven times, including four performances conducted by Mackerras himself.[9] Gervase Hughes wrote, ""Although the orchestration is disfigured by over-reliance on glissando harps and succulent counter-subjects for the horns, much of the music comes over well in its new guise, and the combination of a melody from the opening chorus of Patience with the second act quintet from The Gondoliers is quite brilliant.""[10] A black-and-white studio film of Pineapple Poll, danced by the Royal Ballet, with the London Symphony Orchestra conducted by Mackerras, was broadcast by BBC television in 1959. It starred Merle Park, David Blair and Stanley Holden.[11] A DVD of this film was released in 2011 (also including The Lady and the Fool). A review in Musicweb International commented, ""As a score, [Pineapple Poll] quite simply sparkles like freshly popped champagne. ... In fact, this is a comic masterpiece. Any viewer will be impressed with the vivacious dancing and the 'built in' humour which pervades the work ... would that it had been in colour!  The costumes look as if they would have been absolutely magnificent. ... [T]he studio-based performance means that there is a distinct lack of the atmosphere that an audience would have provided.""[12] Medici.tv also broadcast this film in 2011.[13]

Synopsis[edit]
Scene 1[edit]
H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun has arrived in Portsmouth, and the sailors, who are on shore leave, meet some pretty town's girls whom they like. Pineapple Poll then arrives with a basket of flowers. The sailors buy the flowers from Pineapple Poll to give to their girlfriends, some doing so reluctantly. Jasper, the 'pot boy' at the local inn, serves drinks to some of the sailors. Jasper is very interested in Pineapple Poll, but she haughtily rejects his proffered love.
Captain Belaye of H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun then arrives, and the sailors are horrified when their girlfriends swoon at the sight of the Captain. The sailors attempt to stop the girls, without success. Pineapple Poll also tries to capture the Captain's attention, but she does not have Jasper's restraining hand to stop her. When Captain Belaye is finally left alone, a girl (Blanche) arrives with her aunt (Mrs. Dimple). It is love at first sight for both the Captain and Blanche. Mrs. Dimple is initially opposed to the Captain's interest in her niece, but she finally relents.
When Captain Belaye returns to the port, the town's girls and Pineapple Poll once again try to capture his interest. Captain Belaye manages to escape from the girls with much difficulty, and the girls are then left sighing after the Captain, while the members of his crew vent their anger against him.

Scene 2[edit]
It is nightfall, and some 'sailors' go up the gangplank to board the ship. Pineapple Poll arrives on the wharf with some naval clothes in which she then dresses herself (off-stage), following which Pineapple Poll also then goes up the gangplank to the ship.
Jasper arrives at the wharf and is devastated to find Pineapple Poll's clothes. He mistakenly assumes that Pineapple Poll has drowned. Despondently, he gathers up Pineapple Poll's clothing and leaves.

Scene 3[edit]
The following morning, on board H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun, Captain Belaye is taking his 'crew' through drill. Although his 'crew' is dressed in the usual ship's uniforms, they are far smaller in build than usual – however, the Captain does not seem to realise that there is a disparity in their heights. The uniform which Pineapple Poll is wearing is not a uniform which a sailor would wear on board H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun, and she continually exercises en pointe, but the Captain appears oblivious to anything unusual about her as well. Captain Belaye also does not notice that his 'sailors' are looking up adoringly at him. When the cannon is fired, he is surprised at the reaction of the 'sailors', including Pineapple Poll (who faints at the sound). A church bell then tolls in the distance, and the Captain leaves the ship. A short while later, the Captain returns to the ship with Blanche (who is dressed as a bride) and Mrs. Dimple. The 'crew' all faint with shock. Pineapple Poll is the first to recover and to demonstrate to Captain Belaye that she is female. Then the other 'sailors' demonstrate that they, too, are female. Blanche is horrified, as is her aunt, at the ship's crew all being girls, and the Captain looks stunned.
The ship's genuine crew then arrive, as does Jasper. The sailors are very annoyed with their girlfriends, and the girls have to coax and cajole the sailors to take them back. Jasper has a tougher time with Pineapple Poll, who is still hankering after the Captain.
Belaye, who has now been promoted to the rank of Admiral, returns to the deck with his bride, Blanche, and Blanche's Aunt, Mrs. Dimple. Pineapple Poll swoons at the sight of the Admiral, much to Jasper's distress. Mrs. Dimple calls to Jasper and then gives him the Admiral's former Captain's attire. Jasper puts on the Captain's hat and coat – and becomes the new Captain of H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun as a result (even though Jasper has never been a sailor), and Pineapple Poll's affections and interest are immediately transferred from the Admiral to Jasper. The sailors of H.M.S. Hot Cross Bun are most displeased that the 'pot boy' has suddenly been elevated to be their Captain, and they openly show their disdain for him.
All of the girls then return to the ship's deck, wearing their own clothes, and are welcomed back by their delighted boyfriends. The girls swoon at the sight of Jasper in his new Captain's uniform, but this time the sailors are able to keep their girlfriends in check, and all ends happily.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Pirates of Penzance – The Ballet! is a comic ballet adapted from Gilbert and Sullivan's 1879 Savoy Opera The Pirates of Penzance. The plot is the same as in the opera, and the music is arrangements of Arthur Sullivan's original music for the opera.


Scenario[edit]
After the music begins, an usher leads four people (who turn out to be opera singers) on stage as they loudly discuss mundane matters.  As the audience begins showing its irritation, the singers are seated as an onstage audience.[1]  During the ballet, they sing part of the original score of Pirates, sometimes using new lyrics, as the dancers act out the story.  In character as audience members, the singers interact with the pirates and police at times.

Productions[edit]
The work, originally titled Pirates! The Ballet, was created for the Queensland Ballet.  The choreographer was Daryl Gray, with orchestration by Henry Aronson and design by Christopher Smith. The world première took place at the Suncorp Theatre in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, on 12 April 1991.
Between 1991 and 1995, Gray slightly restructured the ballet and added 4 singers with musical staging to its cast.  The Queensland Ballet performed the revised work in 1996, following which the company took it on an extended tour to the United States presented by Columbia Artists Management.  Gray largely re-choreographed the work for Ballet San Jose for a 2004 revival and retitled Pirates of Penzance – The Ballet!.  In 2008, Orlando Ballet, under the direction of Bruce Marks, toured the ballet in Florida.  It was again revived in November 2009 at Ballet San Jose.  The San Francisco Chronicle reviewer wrote of the revival, ""the show is a perpetual motion machine. ...  Ebullient, athletic, bright as a picture book and blurrily overstuffed, Ballet San Jose's Pirates of Penzance is a crowd pleaser by default.  With all that's happening onstage, how can you not be entertained?""  However, ""the libretto, score and theatrical elements tend to combine without much mutual enrichment.""[2]  Rita Felciano of San Jose Mercury News called the production ""delightfully wacky"", writing: ""this laugh-out-loud comedy is guaranteed to cure you of the vapors!""[3]
The San Francisco Chronicle commented that the audience focus is split between the singers and the dancers, and that the ballet ""proudly flies under the more-is-more flag.  From the steps packed into each dancer's arsenal to dauntingly busy crowd scenes, the show is a perpetual motion machine.  Now and then, as if they didn't have enough to do, the dancers break into tap, jazz, Broadway shimmies or moonwalk riffs, as if in tribute to the late Michael Jackson.""  The review added, ""In the famous 'Major General' patter song, for example, the singers offer some of the deliciously impacted wordplay while the character ... runs through a whirling dumb show. Eventually, as if the lyrics were superfluous, the singers leave off"".[2]  Nevertheless, according to a 2004 review by the same paper, ""the audience happily allows itself to be taken prisoner.""[4]

Pavel Gerdt in the Saint-Léon/Minkus Le Poisson d'or, St. Petersburg, 1867
Le Poisson doré (The Golden Fish) (ru: Золотая рыбка; a.k.a. Zolotaia Ribka) is a ""fantastic ballet"" in 4 acts/6 scenes with prologue and epilogue. The choreography was by Arthur Saint-Léon, and the music by Ludwig Minkus.


History[edit]
Chief ballet-master of the St. Petersburg Imperial troupe Arthur Saint-Léon created in 1864 ballet The Little Humpbacked Horse, which was a huge success. It was the first ballet on the Russian theme and the choreographer decided to continue to develop this theme.
The scenario of this ballet was derived from Alexander Pushkin's 1835 poem The Tale of the Fisherman and the Fish.
Saint-Léon wrote the libretto and made great changes: Pushkin’s heroes had not names – choreographer named them Galia and Taras; the characters of Pushkin lived on the shore of the sea - choreographer settled them in the Ukrainian village near the river Dnepr; in the Pushkin tale there were only two characters and the Golden Fish – choreographer gave them neighbours, etc.
The ballet was first presented (only Act I) by the Hermitage Theatre in Saint Petersburg on November 20/December 2 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1866.[1] Praskovya Lebedeva performed the lead role Galia.[2]
As chief choreographer of the Imperial ballet, Arthur Saint-Léon traveled from time to time to France and staged ballets at the Paris Opera. In 1866, he prepared for Paris the ballet La source. He invited Guglielmina Salvioni to dance the role of Naïla.[3] The first production opened at the Théâtre Impérial de l´Opéra in Paris on 12 November 1866. Guglielmina Salvioni was such a success that the Paris theater critics praised her.[4] Arthur Saint-Léon decided to continue working with her and invited her to Russia. She left for Russia in 1867. At this time Arthur Saint-Léon finished the ballet Le Poisson doré. Praskovya Lebedeva retired and Guglielmina Salvioni replaced her in the title role.
The complete work was then presented by the Imperial Ballet on October 8–20, 1867 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia. Principal dancers at the première were Guglielmina Salvioni (as Galia) and Timofei Stukolkin (as Taras). In other roles: Clavdya Kantzyreva as the Golden Fish, Lev Ivanov as Petro, Nikolay Troitskiy as Jester, Pavel Gerdt as Fisherman.

Social life in Russia[edit]
In these years, Russia's democratic movement grew. Representatives of the aristocracy occupied all the main important posts, but already a new class of Raznochintsy had arisen and were clamoring for the arts. Choreographer Saint-Léon's ballet Le Poisson doré glorified imperial power, which is understandable, since his work with the Imperial troupe was how he earned his living.
Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin ridiculed this ballet in his article: ""I love ballet for its constancy. New governments are created; new people appear in the picture; new facts are being born; the whole structure of life is changing; science and arts are watching these events with anxious attention, as they supplement and sometimes alter their very content - only ballet hears nothing and knows nothing <...> But never before was the one-dimensional thinking of ballet and its conservative beginnings so brightly expressed, as in the ballet ""Le Poisson Doré"", staged last year at the Bolshoi theater of St Petersburg"".[5]

After Guglielmina Salvioni[edit]
After Guglielmina Salvioni the Russian dancers played the role of Galia: Alexandra Kemmerer, Ekaterina Vazem, Vera Liadova (the first wife of Lev Ivanov), but success with the audience not used them and ballet Le Poisson doré was dropped from the repertoire several months later.[6]

A new version[edit]
In 1903 A. A. Gorsky made a new version of the ballet at Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. He wrote a new libretto, deleted the names, complemented the music of Ludwig Minkus by music of other composers: Alexander Serov, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, Léo Delibes, Johannes Brahms. Ballet of the 3 acts became 4.
Performers: Nikolay Domashov as Old Man, Sofia Fedorova as Old Woman, Enrichetta Grimaldi as the Golden Fish. A small role of butterfly was performed by the 11-year-old future prominent choreographer Kasyan Goleizovsky.[7]
Ballet in this version was several years. There was not more productions.

Ballet by Christopher Wheeldon


PolyphoniaChoreographerChristopher WheeldonMusicGyörgy LigetiPremiereJanuary 4, 2001 (2001-01-04)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignHolly Hynes
Polyphonia is a one-act ballet choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon to music by György Ligeti, costumes designed by Holly Hynes, and was created for the New York City Ballet. It premiered on January 4, 2001 at the New York State Theater. It is regarded as Wheeldon's breakthrough,[1] and won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production in 2003.


Production[edit]
Performed by the New York City Ballet, Polyphonia premiered on January 4, 2001 at the New York State Theater.[2] It was the first premiere of the company's winter season.[3]
Polyphonia is the first ballet Wheeldon created after he became artist-in-residence with the New York City Ballet and retired from dancing.[4] It is plotless.[5] Wheeldon described it as ""romantic with comic twists"",[2] and said it was inspired by Norman Morrice's works, though reviewers have noted it also includes homage to Frederick Ashton and George Balanchine, especially the latter's ""leotard ballets"".[6][3] The title is a reference to micropolyphony, a kind of polyphonic musical texture developed by György Ligeti, whose music is used in this ballet.[3]
The cast includes four men and four women, including Wendy Whelan, who went on to create 12 more roles for Wheeldon, and became his most frequent collaborator until she retired from NYCB in 2014. She later credited working with Wheeldon on Polyphonia for helping her ""began to find herself as a dancer"", and Wheeldon said Whelan ""launched me as a choreographer"".[7]

Other companies and revivals[edit]
External videos PNB's Polyphonia excerpts, YouTube video
In 2002, Polyphonia premiered in London, danced by Benjamin Millepied's group Danses Concertantes which consisted of NYCB dancers, at Sadler's Wells Theatre.[8] In the 2003 Laurence Olivier Awards, the production won Best New Dance Production, and Wheeldon was also nominated for Outstanding Achievement in Dance for choreographing Polyphonia and Tryst.[9] The Royal Ballet, where Wheeldon had also danced, and San Francisco Ballet both debuted Polyphonia in 2003.[1][10] Wheeldon's own troupe, the Morphoses/The Wheeldon Company, had also danced Polyphonia, with a cast consisted of NYCB dancers, except 15-year-old Beatriz Stix-Brunell, later a Royal Ballet first soloist.[11] In 2015, Polyphonia became Wheeldon's first work performed by the Paris Opera Ballet, as part of a mixed bill honoring the 90th birthday of Pierre Boulez, a conductor and composer who knew Ligeti.[12] Other companies that had danced it include Boston Ballet,[13] The Washington Ballet[14] and Miami City Ballet.[15]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



The Prince of the Pagodas is a ballet created for The Royal Ballet by choreographer John Cranko with music commissioned from Benjamin Britten. Its premiere took place on 1 January 1957 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, conducted by Britten.
In February 1957 a recording of a slightly cut version of the score was made by Decca with Britten conducting the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House.
The ballet was revived at the same venue on 7 December 1989 in a new production by Kenneth MacMillan, achieving acclaim for Darcey Bussell's work in a principal role. Another production, set in Japan, was created by David Bintley for the National Ballet of Japan and premiered by that company on 30 October 2011; this was adopted by Birmingham Royal Ballet and danced in 2014 at The Lowry, Salford.


Background[edit]
In January 1954, Sadler's Wells Ballet announced that Cranko was collaborating with Benjamin Britten to create a ballet. Cranko devised a draft scenario for a work he originally called The Green Serpent, fusing elements drawn from King Lear, Beauty and the Beast (a story he had choreographed for Sadler's Wells in 1948) and the oriental tale published by Madame d'Aulnoy as Serpentin Vert. Creating a list of dances, simply describing the action and giving a total timing for each, he passed this to Britten and left him to compose what eventually became The Prince of the Pagodas.[1]
Britten dedicated the score to Imogen Holst and Ninette de Valois.[2]

Plot synopsis[edit]
An Emperor must decide which of his two daughters should inherit the throne, and he chooses the evil older sister Belle Epine over the young and beautiful Belle Rose. Belle Rose is taken by magical flying frogs to Pagoda Land, and meets the Prince of Pagoda Land who is in the guise of a Salamander. Belle Rose and the Prince return to the land of her father and confront her evil sister, in the end driving her away.[3]

Influence of Balinese gamelan on the music[edit]
Britten incorporated many elements of Balinese gamelan music into the score of The Prince of the Pagodas, including simulating the seven-tone pelog tuning on Western instruments. Britten was first exposed to gamelan music by Canadian composer Colin McPhee, who had lived in Bali from 1931–38.[4] Britten utilized a “pseudo-gamelan” sound in several of his works, including Paul
Bunyan and Peter Grimes, after meeting McPhee. Britten also performed works of other composers which included references to gamelan music, such as Francis Poulenc’s Concerto for Two Pianos and Orchestra, which Britten performed with the composer in 1945 and again in 1955, after he had agreed to write a ballet with Cranko.[5]
However, perhaps the most influential experience in gamelan music for Britten was a two-week holiday he took in Bali in 1956. He made a thorough study of gamelan music while he was there and immediately began incorporating Balinese musical ideas into The Prince of the Pagodas. For example, in the Prelude of the ballet, the Salamander Prince theme is played by several instruments in a layered texture, where the instruments are playing in different keys and start the theme at slightly different times in a technique called polyphonic stratification, which is typical of Balinese gamelan music.[6]
Another way in which Britten achieves a gamelan sound is through his instrumentation. His score calls for a variety of percussion instruments, including gong, cymbals, bells, xylophone, and vibraphone, and uses these Western percussion instruments in different ways to produce a gamelan sound. For instance, Britten combines the sounds of an orchestral gong and a double bass to represent the Balinese colotomic gong.[7]
The pentatonic scale, a signature of Oriental music in general, makes frequent appearances in the ballet as well, especially in trumpet fanfares which occur throughout the piece.[8] The interval of the major second appears throughout Britten's gamelan passages, which is normally considered dissonant in Western music but arises from the alternate scales and tunings of gamelan style music.[9]
Britten uses the gamelan sound in his music to symbolize the magical pagodas of Pagoda Land, where the main character, the princess Belle Rose, is taken after a confrontation with her father, the emperor, and her evil sister, Belle Epine. When Belle Rose enters Pagoda Land, she is greeted with gamelan music. Similarly, when the Salamander enters the scene, he is portrayed alongside softer gamelan music to produce a mystical air. The Salamander is revealed to be the human Prince of Pagodaland, and when he changes to a human form, the gamelan music is replaced with more traditional Western orchestral music.[10]

(Redirected from The Prodigal Son (ballet))
Ballet by George Balanchine to music by Sergei Prokofiev
This article is about Balanchine's 1929 ballet. For other uses, see The Prodigal Son (disambiguation).
Prodigal Son, or Le Fils prodigue, Op. 46 (Russian: Блудный сын) is a ballet created for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes by George Balanchine to music by Sergei Prokofiev (1928–29).  The libretto, based on the parable in the Gospel of Luke, was by Boris Kochno, who added a good deal of drama and emphasized the theme of sin and redemption ending with the Prodigal Son's return. 
Susan Au writes in Ballet and Modern Dance that the ballet was the last of the Diaghilev era, choreographed the year the great impresario died.  She continues: ""Adapted from the biblical story, it opens with the prodigal's rebellious departure from home and his seduction by the beautiful but treacherous siren, whose followers rob him. Wretched and remorseful, he drags himself back to his forgiving father.""[1]


History[edit]
Serge Lifar created the role.[2] The premiere took place on Tuesday, 21 May 1929 at the Théâtre Sarah Bernhardt, Paris, with décor by Georges Rouault and lighting by Ronald Bates, in what was to be the Ballets Russes's last Paris season: ""Balanchine's choreography upset Prokofiev, who conducted the premiere. The composer had envisioned a production that was 'real'; his concept of the Siren, whom he saw as demure, differed radically from Balanchine's. Prokofiev refused to pay Balanchine royalties for his choreography.""[3]
Balanchine's American Ballet danced Prodigal Son at its first public performance in 1934.
The New York City Ballet premiere was on Thursday, 23 February 1950 at City Center of Music and Drama, New York, the title role danced by Jerome Robbins, with lighting by Mark Stanley. Hugh Laing and Francisco Moncion also danced it before it lapsed from the performance rota for a decade. It was restaged in 1960 with Edward Villella in the title role (Villella recounts his work in recreating the role in his autobiography of the same name).[2]
Mikhail Baryshnikov danced it with City Ballet in 1979 and Damian Woetzel danced it at his farewell performance on Wednesday, 18 June 2008.[4]
Prokofiev used the music from the ballet to form the basis of the two versions of his Symphony No. 4 composed in 1929 and 1947, respectively.

The Prospect Before Us is a one act comic ballet in seven scenes, choreographed for the Vic-Wells Ballet by Ninette de Valois to music by William Boyce arranged by Constant Lambert.


Overview[edit]
With its premiere in 1940, the first year of the war, de Valois set out to produce a light-hearted and jolly piece of escapism. Inspired by an eponymous 18th century engraving by Thomas Rowlandson, it has an intricate plot about the rivalry of two 18th century theatrical managers who fight over a troupe of dancers that includes Didelot, Noverre, and Vestris. The final scene with Robert Helpmann as Mr. O'Reilly doing a ""drunk dance"" is well known.[1]

1920 ballet by Igor Stravinsky
This article is about Stravinsky's ballet. For Justin Peck's ballet, see Pulcinella Variations.

Pulcinella is a 21-section ballet by Igor Stravinsky with arias for soprano, tenor and bass vocal soloists, and two sung trios. It is based on the 18th-century play Quatre Polichinelles semblables, or Four similar Pulcinellas, revolving around a stock character from commedia dell'arte. The work premiered at the Paris Opera on 15 May 1920 under the baton of Ernest Ansermet. The central dancer, Léonide Massine, created both the libretto and the choreography, while Pablo Picasso designed the costumes and sets. The ballet was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev, impresario of the Ballets Russes. A complete performance takes 35–40 minutes. Stravinsky revised the score in 1965.


History[edit]
Diaghilev wanted a ballet based on an early 18th-century commedia dell'arte libretto and music then believed to have been composed by Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. This attribution has since been proved to be spurious.[1] Some of the music may have been by Domenico Gallo,[2] Unico Wilhelm van Wassenaer, Carlo Ignazio Monza and Alessandro Parisotti.[3]
Conductor Ernest Ansermet wrote to Stravinsky in 1919 about the project. The composer initially did not like the idea of music by Pergolesi, but once he studied the scores, which Diaghilev had found in libraries in Naples and London, he changed his mind. Stravinsky adapted the older music to a more modern style by borrowing specific themes and textures, but interjecting his modern rhythms, cadences, and harmonies.
Pulcinella marked the beginning of Stravinsky's second phase as a composer, his neoclassical period. He wrote: 

Pulcinella was my discovery of the past, the epiphany through which the whole of my late work became possible. It was a backward look, of course—the first of many love affairs in that direction—but it was a look in the mirror, too.[4]
The ballet was revived and revised by New York City Ballet's balletmasters George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins for their 1972 Stravinsky Festival. They both danced in the performance, Robbins in the title role, and were joined in the premier by Francisco Moncion, who danced the role of The Devil.[5]

Story[edit]
Pulcinella is taken from a manuscript from Naples, dating from 1700, containing a number of comedies portraying the traditional character of the popular Neapolitan stage. This libretto was derived from Quatre Polichinelles semblables (""Four similar Pulcinellas"").
The one-act ballet features Pulcinella, his girlfriend Pimpinella, his friends Furbo, Prudenza and Rosetta, and Florindo and Cloviello. The story starts with Florindo and Cloviello serenading Prudenza and Rosetta. The two women are unimpressed and reply by showering the suitors with water. Prudenza's father, a doctor, appears and chases them away.
A new episode begins with Rosetta, when her father appears. Rosetta dances for Pulcinella and they kiss. But Pimpinella sees this and interrupts them. Florindo and Cloviello arrive and, jealous of Pulcinella, they beat him up.  Pulcinella is stabbed, but this is a set-up event to gain Pimpinella's forgiveness of him. Furbo, disguised as a magician, comes and appears to resurrect Pulcinella in front of everybody. Pimpinella forgives Pulcinella, and Prudenza and Rosetta succumb to Florindo's and Cloviello's wooing. The ballet ends with the marriages of the three couples.

Music[edit]
The music is based on pieces then believed to have been by the Italian composer Giovanni Battista Pergolesi. The following is a description of the musical forces and movements.

Instrumentation[edit]
Pulcinella is scored for a modern chamber orchestra with three solo singers:





Voices

Solo soprano
Solo tenor
Solo bass
Woodwinds

2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo)
2 oboes
2 bassoons
Brass

2 horns in F
1 trumpet in C
1 trombone




Strings

Concertino:
2 violins
1 viola
1 cello
1 contrabass
Ripieno:
8 violins
4 violas
3 celli

Form[edit]
The 35–40-minute ballet has these 21 sections:

Trio (Tempo di minuetto): Pupillette, fiammette d'amore (soprano, tenor, bass)
Finale (Allegro assai)
Pieces based on Pulcinella[edit]
Pulcinella Suite[edit]
Stravinsky extracted a purely instrumental suite from his ballet which was premiered by the Boston Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Pierre Monteux, on 22 December 1922. It has these eight movements:

SinfoniaSerenataScherzino – Allegretto – AndantinoTarantellaToccataGavotta (con due variazioni)Vivo (Duetto prior to revision)Minuetto – Finale
The suite was revised in 1947 to correct printing errors, change metronome markings and rename part VII.[6]

Suite italienne[edit]
Stravinsky based the following works on the ballet:

1925: Suite d'après des thèmes, fragments et morceaux de Giambattista Pergolesi, for violin and piano (in collaboration with Paul Kochanski).
1932/33: Suite italienne, for cello and piano (in collaboration with Gregor Piatigorsky).
1933: Suite italienne, for violin and piano (in collaboration with Samuel Dushkin).
Violinist Jascha Heifetz and Piatigorsky later made an arrangement for violin and cello, which they also called Suite italienne.

Pulcinella Variations is a one-act ballet by Justin Peck, set to Igor Stravinsky's Pulcinella Suite, with costumes designed by Tsumori Chisato. The ballet premiered on September 28, 2017, danced by the New York City Ballet, at the David H. Koch Theater.[1]

Radio and Juliet is an hour long ballet setup in 2005 for the Slovenian company Ballet Maribor in Slovenia. It was directed by Romanian dancer and choreographer Edward Clug.[1] The ballet is a rendition of William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet set music of Radiohead. Since 2005 Radio and Juliet has  guested in the Netherlands, Italy, Singapore, Korea, Israel, Canada, United States, Russia, Ukraine, Brazil, Serbia and Croatia. It has also been set on the companies of Bucharest National Theater and Kiev National Opera. On 15 September 2012, the 100th performance was celebrated on the old stage of the Maribor Opera house.
The ballet premiered in the United States in 2008 at the Pittsburgh International Festival of Firsts at the Byham Theater.[2]
Noted for the ballet's choreography and simplicity, Radio and Juliet represents a modernized interpretation of Shakespeare. As stated by Edward Clug, ""You could call this quite a twisted version... My intention was not to retell the story but offer the audience an experience from a different perspective.""


Modernized Shakespeare[edit]
The scenes and structure of the ballet do not match the original Romeo and Juliet written by Shakespeare. However, the conflict between the Capulets and Montagues and the masquerade ball scenes are included.[2] The ballet begins with Juliet waking up from her deathlike coma to Romeo being gone and continues through her flashbacks. The ballet also uses video effects that zoom in on specific body parts of the cast during their performance. Every scene is a recanted memory of Juliet's. The play focuses on Juliet's perspective rather than the original storyline of the conflict between families. Juliet also does not take her own life like in the original play, as Edward Clug wanted to show her perspective after choosing to live rather than kill herself once she discovers Romeo dead; instead of Romeo drinking poison after thinking Juliet has killed herself, he eats a lemon.

Major cast[edit]
Bojana Nenadovic Otrin (cast on Premiere) and Tijuana Krizman-Hudernik as Juliet
Eugen Dobrescu (cast on Premiere) and  Matjaz Marin as Romeo
Christian Guerematchi/Edward Clug as Mercutio
There are four other male dancers. The outfits worn by the cast are simple, the men wear suits without shirts and Juliet wears a corset. During the masquerade ball scene, the men wear surgical masks.[2]

Music[edit]
The entire score of the ballet are songs performed by the British rock band Radiohead. Most of the music is taken from albums OK Computer and Kid A.[3] The robotic voice from the album OK Computer matches the robotic choreography and is used for a solo by Juliet. The ballet uses 11 Radiohead songs including ""Fitter Happier,"" ""Bullet Proof... (I Wish I Was),"" ""Idioteque,"" ""How to Disappear Completely"", and ""Like Spinning Plates.""[3]
The songs are used to create an atmosphere. The lyrics sometimes match the scene that is taking place like ""Bullet Proof... (I Wish I Was)"" during Mercutio's death scene. The song lyrics reinforce the fundamental element of the love story, struggling with relationships, however, the music is more important to the story as Edward Clug says, ""There are moments when the story meets the lyrics, but that was not really the point. It's the overall emotion they create in their music.""
The ballet includes the song ""Exit Music (For a Film)"" from the album OK Computer which was originally created for the 1996 film Romeo + Juliet starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Claire Danes. The song appeared in the closing credits of the film but not on the soundtrack recording.

Choreography[edit]
The choreography is made up of sharp body movements. This is supposed to symbolize that love and romance have been affected by ""the cold hand of mechanization.""[4] Common movements include the arching of the torso, the bending of the wrists paired with elbow motions, and stabbing motions of the feet and legs. The choreography includes twitching and jerking motions which give the appearance of robots on stage.[5]
The scenes are structured in a way so that the characters move in a series of steps. First, they begin with head movements, then the body lifts, then the characters weave in and out one another where pairing and partnered dancing takes place. Twitching continues throughout the dance. When Mercutio dies, the last thing he does is twitch. This is the same for the final scene of the dance, Juliet executes slight head twitches over Romeo's dead body.[5]

Ragtime (I) is the second of three ballets made by New York City Ballet's co-founder and balletmaster George Balanchine to Igor Stravinsky's 1918 Ragtime for Eleven Instruments; with scenery by Robert Drew previously used for Lew Christensen's 1947 work for Ballet Society, Blackface; costumes by Karinska and lighting by David Hays. The premiere took place on December 7, 1960, at City Center of Music and Drama, conducted by Robert Irving, as part of a quartet of works titled Jazz Concert, together with dances by Todd Bolender's Creation of the World, Francisco Moncion's Les biches and John Taras' Ebony Concerto. Balanchine's 1966 Ragtime (II) was also made for City Ballet; his previous ballet to Stravinsky's Ragtime was one of a number of ""informal little things"" made in St. Petersburg in 1922.[1]

316,The Rake's Progress,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rake%27s_Progress_(ballet%29,"The Rake's Progress , Gavin Gordon , 1935","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



The Rake's Progress is a short 1935 ballet based on the drawings of William Hogarth, with music by Gavin Gordon (1901-1970), choreography by Ninette de Valois, and set design by Rex Whistler. 
Gavin Gordon had written some earlier ballets that were not successful. By contrast, The Rake's Progress was an instant hit and has remained in the repertoires of a number of ballet companies. It is the only work of Gavin Gordon's that is remembered today.


Background[edit]
Gordon based his scenario for the ballet on Hogarth's series of paintings called A Rake's Progress. These paintings influenced him far more literally than was the case with Igor Stravinsky in his 1951 operatic treatment.  Stravinsky's Hogarthian borrowings were limited to the name of the protagonist, the general notion of his progress, and specific ideas for two of the scenes.[1]
The ballet was Gordon's own concept, and he persuaded Ninette de Valois to choreograph it.
The Rake's Progress was produced at the Sadler's Wells Theatre in 1935. The costumes and scenery were by Rex Whistler. They were destroyed in the Netherlands during the Second World War, while Sadler's Wells were visiting that country, but were remade for a revival.[2]

Structure[edit]
The ballet consists of the following numbers: 

Prelude
The Reception
The Dancing Lesson (Menuetto galante)
The Orgy (Rondo)
The Faithful Girl (Loure)
The Gambling Den (Gigue)
Outside the Prison Gates (Sarabande)
The Mad House (Quodlibet).
Gordon employed the Swannee whistle in his orchestration.[3]
The ballet has had several recordings (conductors include Constant Lambert and Barry Wordsworth).[4]
Robert Helpmann, who was in the original cast,[5] included it in The Royal Ballet's first tour of Australia in 1956.[6] Other major artists to be associated with The Rake's Progress include Margot Fonteyn and Beryl Grey.

RAkU is a 37-minute ballet choreographed by Yuri Possokhov that was commissioned by San Francisco Ballet (Possokhov's 13th work for the company)[2] and set to original music composed by Shinji Eshima.[3] The première took place on Thursday, 3 February 2011 at the War Memorial Opera House, San Francisco.

Overview[edit]
Program notes for the ballet stated: ""Based on the true story of the burning of Kyoto’s Golden Pavilion in 1950, RAkU is set in a much earlier time and in a style similar to Noh theater, which presents the essence of a story rather than a literal depiction... Despite its Japanese story and setting, RAkU contains no traditional Japanese dance or music; Possokhov is more interested in tone, aesthetics, and visual inventiveness than in reenacting history. Combining folk-based steps and Butoh (a post–World War II Japanese dance form utilizing extremely slow movements) with classically based movement, he makes every emotion in this ballet visual and vivid.""[2]
The world premiere cast of RAkU consisted of Yuan Yuan Tan as the Princess, Damian Smith as her warrior husband, Pascal Molat as the evil monk and four warriors (Gaetano Amico, Sean Orza, Jeremy Rucker and Quinn Wharton). San Francisco Ballet restaged it in 2012 and 2015. In 2014, Yuan Yuan Tan won the Critics' Circle National Dance Award for Outstanding Female Performance (Classical) for her portrayal of the Princess in RAkU.[4]
On March 13, 2012, an audio recording of RAkU was released. It was performed by the San Francisco Ballet Orchestra and chanters of the San Francisco Zen Center, and led by San Francisco Ballet Music Director and Principal Conductor Martin West at Skywalker Sound on April 22, 2011.[5]
San Francisco Ballet also mounted RAkU on tour at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa in September 2011. The orchestra, led by Maestro Martin West, included members of The Pacific Symphony and the Buddhist chants were performed by the Zen Center of Los Angeles. The Company also brought RAkU to Sadler's Wells Theatre in London in September 2012[6] and the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. in November 2012.[7]
RAkU joined the repertory of the Joffrey Ballet in September 2014[8] (the score was performed by Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra, led by Scott Speck) and was revived in 2016.[9] Pacific Northwest Ballet had their company premiere of the work in Seattle in April 2018 (staged by Quinn Wharton).[10]
A one-hour documentary by Shirley Sun about RAkU called Fire and Ashes, Making the Ballet RAkU[11] had its world premiere at the Brava Theater Center on October 20, 2017 as part of the San Francisco Dance Film Festival.[12] The documentary had its New York premiere on July 21, 2018 as part of the Dance on Camera Festival at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center.[13]

Ballet choreographed by Marius Petipa and with music by Alexander Glazunov

Raymonda (Russian: Раймонда) is a grand ballet in three acts, four scenes with an apotheosis, originally choreographed by Marius Petipa to the music of Alexander Glazunov (his opus 57) and libretto by Lydia Pashkova. Raymonda was created especially for the benefit performance of the prima ballerina Pierina Legnani, and first presented by the Imperial Ballet at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre on 19 January [O.S. 7 January] 1898 in Saint Petersburg, Russia. Among the ballet's most celebrated passages is the Pas classique hongrois (a.k.a. Raymonda Pas de dix) from the third act, which is often performed independently.
Today Raymonda is performed by many ballet companies throughout the world with choreography that is derived primarily from the Kirov Ballet's 1948 revival as staged by Konstantin Sergeyev. Sergeyev greatly altered, and in some cases changed entirely, Marius Petipa's choreography, particularly in the dances for the corps de ballet. The choreography as revised by Sergeyev remains the traditional text for most of the world's productions of Raymonda, among them Rudolf Nureyev's version for the Paris Opéra Ballet and Anna-Marie Holmes's version for American Ballet Theatre, respectively.
The choreography and mise-en-scène of the Imperial Ballet's original production of Raymonda was recorded in 1905 in the method of Stapanov choreographic notation during rehearsals for performances starring the renowned Russian ballerina Olga Preobrajenskaya in the title role. Today, this notation is part of Harvard University's Sergeyev Collection.
In 2011 Sergei Vikharev utilized the notation to stage a new version of Raymonda for the Ballet of the Teatro alla Scala. The production also restored the original décor and costumes from designs prepared for the first production of 1898.

Revivals[edit]
The full-length Raymonda has been revived many times throughout its performance history, the most noted productions being staged by Mikhail Fokine for the Ballets Russes (1909); Anna Pavlova for her touring company (1914); George Balanchine and Alexandra Danilova for the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo (1946); Konstantin Sergeyev for the Kirov Ballet (1948); Rudolf Nureyev for American Ballet Theatre (1975) and for the Paris Opera Ballet (1983); Yuri Grigorovich for the Bolshoi Ballet (1984); Anna-Marie Holmes (in a 2-act reduction) for the Finnish National Ballet (2004), a version which was then staged for American Ballet Theatre (2004) and the Dutch National Ballet (2005).
There have been many productions around the world of only extracts from the full-length Raymonda, for the most part taken from the Grand Pas Classique hongrois from the third act, which is considered to be among Marius Petipa's supreme masterpieces. The most noted of these productions have been staged by George Balanchine for the New York City Ballet (1955, 1961, 1973); Rudolf Nureyev for the Royal Ballet Touring Company (1964); and Mikhail Baryshnikov for American Ballet Theatre (1980, 1987).
In 2005 the Australian Ballet Company performed a modern version of Raymonda set in the 1950s, where Raymonda is a Hollywood star who has filmed her last film before marrying a European prince. It was choreographed by Stephen Baynes and bears no resemblance to the original ballet.
In January 2022, the English National Ballet presented a new version of this ballet choreographed by Tamara Rojo at the London Coliseum. Rojo has relocated the story to the 19th-century Crimean War, drawing on the figure of Florence Nightingale to create a Raymonda who redefines the role of women in wartime and society. This Raymonda is not content to stay at home and sew, so she hot-foots it from England across the Black Sea to Sevastopol. There, she tends to injured soldiers, and is reacquainted with John de Bryan, a family friend, who has joined the Light Brigade. As he leaves for battle, he persuades Raymonda to accept his hand in marriage. His friend, Abdur Rahman, an ally from the Ottoman army, promises to take care of Raymonda until de Bryan returns.

Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
Scene 1: Raymonda's feast
At the castle of Doris, preparations are under way for the celebrations of the young countess Raymonda’s name day. Countess Sybille, her aunt, chides those who are present, including Raymonda's two friends Henrietta and Clémence, and the two troubadours Béranger and Bernard, for their idleness and their passion for dancing, telling them of the legendary White Lady, the protector of the castle, who warns the Doris household every time one of its members is in danger and casts punishment on those who do not fulfil their duties. The young people laugh at the countess’s superstitions and continue to celebrate. The seneschal of the Doris castle announces the arrival of a messenger, sent by Raymonda's fiancé, the noble crusader knight, Jean de Brienne, bearing a letter for his beloved. Raymonda rejoices when she reads that King Andrew II of Hungary, for whom Jean de Brienne has fought, is returning home in triumph and Jean de Brienne will arrive at the Doris castle the next day for their wedding. Suddenly, the celebrations are interrupted when the seneschal announces the arrival of an uninvited Saracen knight, Abderakhman and his entourage, who have stopped at the castle seeking shelter for the night. Captivated by Raymonda's beauty, Abderakhman falls in love with her at once and resolves to do anything to win her. The party lasts late into the night and, left alone and exhausted by the day, Raymonda lies down on a couch and falls asleep. As she sleeps, she begins to dream that the White Lady appears illuminated by the moonlight and, with an imperious gesture, orders Raymonda to follow her.
Scene 2: The Visions
The White Lady, without making a sound, advances along the terrace. Raymonda follows her in a state of unconsciousness. At a signal from the White Lady, the garden is wrapped in mist. A moment later, the mist vanishes and Jean de Brienne appears. Overjoyed, Raymonda runs into his arms and they are surrounded by glory, knights and celestial maidens. The garden is illuminated by a fantastic light and Raymonda expresses her joy to the White Lady, who interrupts her enthusiasm with a vision of what awaits her. Raymonda wants to return to her fiancé, but instead, she finds Abderakhman, who has taken Jean de Brienne's place. Abderakhman declares his passionate love for her, but Raymonda, though confused and upset, is quick to reject him. Imps and elves appear from everywhere surrounding Raymonda, who begs the White Lady to save her and Abderakhman tries to take Raymonda by force. Raymonda cries out and falls to the ground in a faint. The frightful vision disappears along with the White Lady.

Act II[edit]
The Courtyard of the Castle
The feast in honour of Jean de Brienne's arrival is taking place. Raymonda welcomes her guests, but cannot hide her uneasiness caused by Jean de Brienne’s delay. Abderakhman approaches her repeatedly and reveals his passion for her, but remembering the warnings of the White Lady, Raymonda rejects him with contempt. Abderakhman becomes even more insistent and realises the only way to possess Raymonda is by force. He calls his slaves to dance for her, after which he summons his cup bearers and they pour a potion into everyone’s cup, causing all the guests to become drunk. Seizing his chance, Abderakhman grabs Raymonda in an attempt to abduct her, but luckily Jean de Brienne arrives just in time, accompanied by King Andrew II and his knights. Jean de Brienne saves Raymonda from the hands of the Saracens and tries to seize Abderakhman. The King commands the two rivals to put an end to the matter in a duel, during which the White Lady appears on the castle tower. Abderakhman is dazed and dies, slain by Jean de Brienne's sword. Raymonda joyfully embraces her fiancé and the two reaffirm their love as the King joins their hands.

Act III[edit]
The Wedding
Raymonda and Jean de Brienne are finally married and King Andrew II of Hungary gives the newly wedded couple his blessing. In his honour, everyone at court is dressed in Hungarian fashion and perform a range of Hungarian-style dances, ending in an Apotheosis where everyone comes together in a knightly tournament.

Ballet by George Balanchine


Raymonda VariationsChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicAlexander GlazunovPremiereDecember 7, 1961 (1961-12-07)City Center of Music and DramaOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignKarinskaDavid HaysCreated forPatricia WildeJacques d'Amboise
Raymonda Variations, formerly titled Valses et Variations, is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to excepts from Alexander Glazunov's score for the 1898 ballet Raymonda. Instead of following the plot of the 1898 ballet, the Balanchine ballet is plotless. It premiered on December 7, 1961, at the City Center of Music and Drama. Raymonda Variations was made for the New York City Ballet, with the two lead roles originated by Patricia Wilde and Jacques d'Amboise.


Choreography[edit]
Raymonda Variations is danced by two principal dancers, a man and a woman, and ensemble of twelve women.[1] The ballet does not follow the plot of the 1898 Raymonda.[2]: 471  Balanchine explained, ""The music itself, its grand and generous manner, its joy and playfulness, was for me more than enough to carry the plot of the dances.""[2]: 471–472  He described the ballet,When the curtain goes up, twelve girls stand posing in an elegant garden. They dance for us and then the principals, another girl then a boy, join them. Next, the girl and the boy are alone for an adagio. This is followed by a series of nine variations, or solos, by five of the girls and the two principals. The ballet concludes with a coda and a finale by all the dancers.[2]: 471 
Background and production[edit]
The 1898 ballet Raymonda featured choreography by Marius Petipa and a score by Alexander Glazunov. In the ballet, the titular character is engaged to Jean de Brienne, a French knight. However, while Jean leaves to fight at the Crusades, Raymonda is abducted by emir Abderakhman, but was saved by Jean, who Raymonda soon marries.[3]
In his book Balanchine's Complete Stories of the Great Ballets, the choreographer wrote that he had enjoyed the score since he was a student, and whilst studying at the Imperial Ballet School, he performed the ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre, wearing the original costumes.[2]: 411  In 1946, he and Alexandra Danilova staged a production of Raymonda for Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo.[3] In 1955, he used excerpts from the music of Raymonda for his ballet Pas de Dix.[3]
In fall 1961, Balanchine decided to make another ballet to musical excerpts from Raymonda, with Patricia Wilde and Jacques d'Amboise. This would become the last time Balanchine choreograph a ballet on Wilde, who by then was one of the most senior dancers at the New York City Ballet. Wilde had also danced in the 1946 Raymonda.[4] Balanchine began choreographing the ballet after the company's domestic tour that year, when Balanchine called Wilde to the studio, and choreograph a solo on her to music intended for a variation danced by Raymonda's companon Henriette. As Wilde did not know it was for a new ballet, she soon forgot about it. Weeks later, once rehearsals for the ballet officially started, Balanchine rechoreographed the solo.[4] Balanchine also chose five young women in the company to dance other solos.[4]
The costumes were designed by Karinska, and the original lighting was by David Hays.[5] The backdrop Horace Armistead designed for Tudor's Jardin aux lilas was reused.[6] The ballet originally used the working title Raymonda, before premiering under the title Valse et Variations. It was renamed Raymonda Variations in 1963.[5]

Original cast[edit]
The principal dancers in the original cast were:[5]

Patricia Wilde
Jacques d'Amboise
Victoria Simon
Suki Schorer
Gloria Govrin
Carol Summer
Patricia Neary
Performances[edit]
The ballet premiered on December 7, 1961, at the City Center of Music and Drama.[6] At the premiere, d'Amboise's variations were omitted as he was injured. They were added back to the ballet a month later.[4]
Other ballet companies that have performed Raymonda Variations include Houston Ballet,[7] Miami City Ballet,[8] Kansas City Ballet,[9] and Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre.[10]

Critical reception[edit]
Following the premiere, New York Times critic John Martin called the ballet a ""an adorable confection, concocted of marzipan, diamonds, youth and nostalgia.""[1]

The Red Detachment of Women (Chinese: 红色娘子军; pinyin: Hóngsè niángzǐ jūn) is a Chinese ballet which premiered in 1964 and was made one of the Eight Model Operas which dominated the national stage during the Cultural Revolution.


Background and development[edit]
Adapted from the earlier 1961 film of the same title under the personal direction of Zhou Enlai, which in turn adapted from the novel by Liang Xin, it depicts the liberation of a peasant girl in Hainan Island and her rise in the Chinese Communist Party.  The novel was based on the true stories of the 100+ member strong all-female Special Company of the 2nd Independent Division of Chinese Red Army, first formed in May 1931.  As the communist base in Hainan was destroyed by the nationalists, most of the members of the female detachment survived, partially because they were women and easier to hide among the local populace who were sympathetic to their cause. After the communist victory in China, the representatives of the surviving members were taken to Beijing and personally inspected and praised by Mao Zedong. In 2014, Lu Yexiang, the last member of red detachment of women, died in Qionghai, Hainan.[1]
The ballet was later adapted to a Beijing opera in 1964, and as with the ballet itself, both stage and film versions were produced. The 1970 film version of the ballet made Xue Jinghua (as Wu Qinghua) and Liu Qingtang (as Hong Changqing) superstars along with a dozen other artists who were cast as protagonists in other model plays of the time. It is one of the so-called eight model plays in China during the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976). With The White Haired Girl, it is regarded as a revolutionary Chinese ballet, and its music is familiar to almost every Chinese person who grew up during that time. It was made into a film in 1972 again, and is now part of the permanent repertoire of the National Ballet of China. It remains a favorite of music and ballet lovers nearly 30 years after the Cultural Revolution in China. It is often performed for international women's day. 
It was collaboratively created by: with music by Du Mingxin, Wu Zuqiang, Wang Yanqiao, Shi Wanchun and Dai Hongwei, and choreography by Li Chengxiang, Jiang Zuhui and Wang Xixian. Many numbers were based on the folk songs of Hainan Island, a place that, with its coconut trees rustling in tropical wind, evokes much romantic ethos. Though there are unmistakable elements of Chinese music, the music of this ballet was performed with basically a Western symphony orchestra.
On 25 December 2015 Chinese Choreographer Wen Hui, the German Director and Dramaturge Kai Tuchmann, and the author Zhuang Jiayun premiered their work RED at the Power Station of Art in Shanghai. RED is a reinterpretation of The Red Detachment of Women and it analyses this model opera/ballet as a politico-cultural symbol that became part of the collective consciousness during the Cultural Revolution. Since its premiere in China, RED is touring around Asia and Europe.[2][3][4]

Meanwhile, the members of the Women's Detachment have secretly gathered around the manor of the Tyrant. It has been agreed that Hong is to fire his gun at midnight as signal for the Detachment to break in to wipe out the Tyrant and his gang in one fell swoop.
At night, all people recede into the houses. Nanbatian comes out to see some of his guests off. Overcome by deep personal hatred, Wu Qinghua shoots Nanbatian, prematurely issuing the battle signal. Nanbatian is merely wounded and escapes from a secret tunnel with a few of his lackeys.

In literature[edit]
The revolutionary ballet is a motif around which develops Jiang Yun's novella, The Red Detachment of Women.[5]

In popular culture[edit]
Images of dancers performing The Red Detachment of Women appear as a theme in the work of visual artists Hung Liu, who grew up in Changchun China but settled in Oakland California.[6] The French film The Chinese in Paris has a six minute long ""play-within-a-play"", that hybridizes the ballet The Red Detachment of Women with the French opera Carmen, calling the production ""Carmeng"".[7]

Other influence[edit]
The Red Detachment of Women Memorial Park in Qionghai was developed in 1998.[8]: 102  The park includes revolutionary-themed sculpture, a museum, coconut groves, and live performances.[8]: 102

The Red Poppy (Russian: Красный мак, romanized: Krasniy mak) or sometimes The Red Flower (Russian: Красный цветок, romanized: Krasniy tsvetok) is a ballet in three acts and eight tableaux with an apotheosis, with a score written by Reinhold Glière and libretto by Mikhail Kurilko. This ballet was created in 1927 as the first Soviet ballet with a modern revolutionary theme. Possibly the most famous dance from this ballet is the Sailors Dance, sometimes referred to as the ""Russian Sailors Dance"" (although it is described as ""Dance of the Sailors from the Soviet Ship"" in the score and libretto). It is this musical selection for which Glière is perhaps best known. There have been four main versions of The Red Poppy.


History[edit]
Original version (1927)[edit]
A scene from the 1927 production of The Red Poppy
The original version of The Red Poppy was choreographed by Lev Lashchiline (1st and 3rd Acts) and Vasily Tikhomirov (2nd Act). The first performance was on 14 June 1927 in the Bolshoi Theatre (which at the time under Soviet rule had been renamed ""First People's State Theatre for Opera and Ballet""). The orchestra was led by Yuri Fayer. The ballet's 100th performance in Moscow occurred on 23 December 1928.
This production was staged in 1928 and 1930 in Sverdlovsk, and in 1928, 1949, and 1958 in Saratov. The Leningradsky Theatre of opera and ballet staged the ballet in 1929 in Leningrad, adding several dances to the production. The original version was performed in 1941 and 1950 in Gorky; in 1946 in Baku by the Azerbaijan State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre; and in 1949 and 1958 by the Kirov Ballet.
In 1943, the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo staged a one-act version of the ballet in the Public Music Hall, Cleveland, Ohio.[1] Premiering on October 9, 1943, the production was staged by Igor Schwezoff, with decor by Boris Aronson. Since World War II was being fought at the time, with the Soviets and Americans allied, the villain Li-Chan-Fou was changed to a Japanese bar owner. The group of Soviet sailors now included British and Americans as well.[2]

The Red Flower (1957)[edit]
In 1957, Vasily Tikhomirov and Mikhail Kurilko staged an expanded version of the ballet. Renamed The Red Flower (to avoid the association with opium), the number of scenes (""tableaux"") was increased from 8 to 13. It was first performed on 24 November 1957 in the Bolshoi Theatre.

Lavrovsky version (1949)[edit]
In 1949 a new version of The Red Poppy was choreographed by Leonid Lavrovsky.[3] The scenario was rewritten by Aleksey Yermolayev, and the ballet was first performed on 30 December 1949 in the Bolshoi Theatre.[3] The 1949 version introduced a new character, Ma Lichen.

Androsov version (2010)[edit]
Ballet triumph in Rome, February 12, 2010
On 12 February 2010, a new production of The Red Poppy, with choreography by Nikolay Androsov, was performed at Teatro dell'Opera di Roma. Scenery and costumes by Elena Puliti, conductor Andre Anichanov, musical cooperation from Francesco Sodini, and director of production Beppe Menegatti. This version introduced a new character,  Nüwa, goddess of fertility. A new production of this version is expected on June 13, 2015, at the Rostov State Opera and Ballet (Musical) Theatre, in Rostov-on-Don.

Vasiliev version (2010)[edit]
Also in 2010, a new production choreographed by Vladimir Vasiliev (who also did scenario editing and scenery), with costumes by Maria Vol'skaya, and music director and conducting by Anatoly Chepurnoy, was performed on 23 November at the Krasnoyarsk Ballet and Opera Theater.

Synopsis[edit]
The ballet takes place at a seaport in 1920s-era Republican China. Ships carrying sailors from many lands, including the Soviet Union, are docked in a Chinese seaport. The Captain of the Soviet Ship notices a group of half-starved, overworked coolies being brutally driven to work even harder by their cruel harbormaster.
One night while dancing for the sailors aboard the ship, the beautiful Taï-Choa (Pinyin: Taohua) notices the Soviet Captain trying to rescue the poor Coolies from the Harbormaster. Impressed by the captain's act of kindness she gives him a red poppy as a symbol of her love.
When Taï-Choa's fiancé, the adventurer Li-Chan-Fou learns of this, he is jealous and orders her to kill the captain. She refuses, and is later killed when a riot breaks out on the dock — thus sacrificing her life for the captain. As she dies, she gives another red poppy flower to a young Chinese girl as a sign of love and freedom.

322,The Red Shoes,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Shoes_(ballet%29,"The Red Shoes , to music by Bernard Herrmann , 2016","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



The Red Shoes is a ballet choreographed by Matthew Bourne using the music of Bernard Herrmann (1911–1975). It is based broadly on the 1948 film  The Red Shoes by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger. The set and costume designs are by Lez Brotherston. The ballet was premiered on 6 December 2016 at Sadler's Wells Theatre, London, by Bourne's ballet company, New Adventures.[1]


Background[edit]
Bourne has said that ""the image of the red shoes that, once put on, will not allow the wearer to stop dancing has long been a potent one for creative minds, from Powell and Pressburger to Kate Bush to Emma Rice... I have loved the film since I was a teenager...My challenge has been to capture some of that surreal, sensuous quality [of the film] within the more natural theatre setting.""[2]
The production uses music written by Herrmann from a variety of his film scores, including those for The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, Fahrenheit 451, Hangover Square, and Citizen Kane. It does not include any of the music written by Brian Easdale for the original 1948 film score.[3][4] Herrmann's music was reorchestrated for the ballet by Terry Davies for an ensemble of strings, pianos, harp, percussion and electronic keyboards.[5] Brotherston's designs include the use of a stage set proscenium arch which can rotate to indicate whether the theatre-based scenes are taking place on-stage or off-stage.[4]

Synopsis[edit]
The ballet is set in London, Monte Carlo and Villefranche-sur-Mer in the period of the late 1940s to early 1950s. The ballerina Victoria Page is talent-spotted by the ballet impresario Boris Lermontov, who is based in Monte Carlo. He commissions the composer Julian Craster to compose a ballet based on Hans Christian Andersen's tale, The Red Shoes. Victoria takes the lead in the ballet, and she and Craster fall in love. Victoria has to choose between her love and her career.  Having returned to London to be with Craster, she ekes out a career dancing in a music hall. The chance of dancing for Lermontov again lures her to return to his ballet company to dance once more in The Red Shoes. Craster pursues her to persuade her to return to him. In her confusion and indecision, fleeing from Lermontov she falls beneath an oncoming train and is killed.[6]

Reception[edit]
Critical response to the premiere was positive. The Observer reported that it was ""a feast for the eye, with every scene animated by sharp detail and witty characterisation...It’s all very artfully composed, and Bourne choreographs with the lightest of touches, threading in references to Hollywood movies and Diaghilev-era ballets as he goes.""[7] The Stage commented that ""This is fine work. If one or two of the events and relationships are too fleeting to register they will develop over time. And time is what Bourne has because like all hand-crafted footwear, The Red Shoes is built to last....[it] is Matthew Bourne's finest achievement to date.""[8]
For his work on The Red Shoes, Bourne won the award of Best Theatre Choreographer and the show itself won Best Entertainment at the 2017 Olivier Awards.[9]

1924 ballet by Francis Picabia


Eric Satie, Francis Picabia, Rene Clair and Jean Biorlin prepare for a November 1924 performance
Relâche is a 1924 ballet by Francis Picabia with music composed by Erik Satie.
The title was thought to be a Dadaist practical joke, as relâche is the French word used on posters to indicate that a show is canceled, or the theater is closed. The first performance was indeed canceled, due to the illness of Jean Börlin, the principal dancer, choreographer, and artistic director of the Ballets Suédois.
Picabia commissioned filmmaker René Clair to create a cinematic entr'acte to be shown during the ballet's intermission. The film, simply titled Entr'acte, consists of a scene shown before the ballet and a longer piece between the acts. The nonsensical film features Picabia, Satie, and other well-known artists as actors.[1]

324,Les Rendezvous,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Rendezvous,"Les Rendezvous , to music by Daniel Auber , 1933","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Les Rendezvous is a plotless one-act ballet created in 1933, with choreography by Frederick Ashton to the music of Daniel Auber (the ballet music from his opera L'enfant prodigue) arranged by Constant Lambert and with designs by William Chappell. It was the first major ballet created by Ashton for the Vic-Wells company.[1]
It was first performed on Tuesday, 5 December 1933 by Vic-Wells Ballet at Sadler's Wells Theatre, with Alicia Markova and Stanislas Idzikowsky in the lead roles; these were later taken by Margot Fonteyn and Robert Helpmann. The choreography was revised in 1934 and the work was performed every season up to 1945, then from 1959 to 1963, when it used the set by Sophie Fedorovitch for Act 1 of La Traviata.[1] It was revived in 1984 by Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet to celebrate Ashton's 80th birthday, and by the Royal Ballet at Covent Garden in 2000 with updated sets. The ballet has also been produced by companies in Norway, the US and Japan.
It was filmed for television in 1962 with Doreen Wells, Brian Shaw, and Merle Park, Petrus Brosnan and Graham Usher in the pas de trois.
Les Rendezvous was Ashton's ""first substantial classical composition and an exultant statement of his idiosyncratic approach to academic ballet."" It consists of a succession of light-hearted dances in a park, where friends meet and socialise.[2]
The ballet was designed to show off the brilliance and style of Markova and the elevation and technical skill of Idzikowsky.[3]
Order of numbers:[3]

Pas de quatre: (four girls)
Male Variation
Adage des Amoureux (two leads)
Pas de trois (girl and two boys)
Female Variation
Pas de six: (six boys)
Sortie des Promeneurs (company)
The Sadler's Well Orchestra, conducted by Charles Mackerras made a recording of the music in July 1950 at Abbey Road studios, but due to the standard of playing it was not published.[4] An LP 'A Silver Jubilee Tribute to Sadler's Wells Ballet' included short extracts with the Royal Opera House Orchestra conducted by Robert Irving.[5]

Le Réveil de Flore (en. The Awakening of Flora), (ru. «Пробуждение Флоры», Probuzhdenie Flory) is a ballet anacréontique in one act, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Riccardo Drigo, to a libretto written by Petipa and Lev Ivanov.[1] First presented by the Imperial Ballet at Peterhof Palace on 6 August [O.S. 25 July] 1894.


History[edit]
Marius Petipa and Riccardo Drigo's one-act ballet Le Réveil de Flore was originally created as a piece d'occasion in honor of the wedding of Emperor Alexander III's daughter, the Grand Duchess Xenia, to the Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich.[2] Their wedding took place at the Cathedral of Peter and Paul at Peterhof on 6 August [O.S. 25 July] 1894 before the whole of the Imperial Russian aristocracy, the Imperial court, foreign royalty, and other prominent members of society. Three days later on 9 August [O.S. 28 July] 1894 the wedding party and guests attended a lavish performance at the newly renovated imperial theatre of Peterhof where Le Réveil de Flore was presented for the first time after the second act of Charles Gounod's Roméo et Juliette.
Le Réveil de Flore was soon transferred to the stage of the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre where it was first performed on 20 January [O.S. 8 January] 1895 with the same cast.[1] This performance took place during a farewell benefit for the ballerina Maria Anderson, who had been forced into early retirement after sustaining burn injuries in a theatre fire.[3]
Le Réveil de Flore was praised by contemporary critics, with the critic of the St. Petersburg Gazette stating that the ballet ""...was one of those masterpieces with which Marius Petipa has made a gift to the ballet stage.""
Riccardo Drigo's music was also acclaimed and was issued in orchestral partition and piano reduction by the music publisher Zimmerman in 1914.

The choreography for Le Réveil de Flore was erroneously credited as a joint effort between Marius Petipa and the Imperial Ballet's second Maître de ballet Lev Ivanov in the original printed theatre programme.[2] A review in the St. Petersburg Gazette of the first répétition générale of the ballet also credited the choreography to both Petipa and Ivanov. This caused Marius Petipa to write a letter of correction to the newspaper: In no. 201 of your much respected newspaper, a not fully accurate communication was reported about the production of the ballet Le Réveil de Flore. The programme of the ballet was created by L. I. Ivanov and me together, (but) the production of the dances and the mise-en-scène belong exclusively to me; Mr. L. I. Ivanov had no part in them.[1]
The ballerina Anna Pavlova included an abridged version of Le Réveil de Flore in the repertory of her touring company. Conductor Richard Bonynge recorded Pavlova's abridged edition of Drigo's score for his 1974 LP ""Homage to Pavlova"" with the London Symphony Orchestra.[4]

2007 revival by Sergei Vikharev[edit]
Le Réveil de Flore was given its final performance in 1919.[5] Marius Petipa's choreography for the ballet was documented in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation soon after its premiere in 1894, being among the first ballets to be recorded in this method. Today this notation is part of the Sergeyev Collection, held in Harvard University Library's theatre collection.
In 2005, the choreographer and historian Sergei Vikharev utilized this choreographic notation to prepare for a revival of the original production of Le Réveil de Flore for the Mariinsky Ballet. The production included décor and costumes based on the original designs, and Riccardo Drigo's score was restored from the original hand-written manuscript held in the archives of the Mariinsky Theatre's music library.[5]
The production was first presented during the VIIth International Ballet Festival on 12 April 2007 at the Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg.

Libretto[edit]
Taken from the original published piano score of 1894.[7]
Tableau 1 — It is night. Flora, the goddess of Spring, is deep asleep with her nymphs; Diana, the goddess of Moon, guards their peace. With the approach of dawn, a freshness is felt in the air. Diana hides in the clouds.
Tableau 2 — Aquilon, the northern wind, rushes stormily over the locale; his cold breath of wind awakens Flora and forces her to seek refuge in the foliage. The appearance of chilling dew brings Flora to despair, and she implores Aurora, the goddess of the dawn, to help them.
Tableau 3 — Aurora consoles Flora with tender caresses and announces that Apollo, the god of day, who will end their sufferings, is following behind her. Aurora, Flora, and her nymphs perform a waltz.
Tableau 4 — With the appearance of resplendent Apollo, everything becomes animated. Smitten with the beauty of Flora, Apollo kisses her. At his call, Zephyr, the god of the gentle west wind, flies to his beloved Flora's embrace. He is followed by Cupid and her little amours. ""You must be his helpmate,"" Apollo tells her, ""It is the will of the gods."" Everyone is delighted; Cupid, amours, and nymphs rejoice over the lover's happiness. A classical Pas d’action is performed.
Tableau 5 — Mercury, messenger of the gods, announces Hebé, the goddess of youth, and Ganymede, cupbearer to the gods. They present Flora and Zephyr a cup of nectar and proclaim that Jupiter has given them eternal youth.
Tableau 6 — A procession. The chariot of Bacchus and Ariadne is accompanied by bacchantes, satyrs, fauns, sylvans, and others. A Grand pas is performed by all assembled, followed by a rousing finale.
Apotheosis — Olympus is revealed; Jupiter appears, Juno, Neptune, Vulcan, Minerva, Ceres, Mars, Pluto, Proserpina, Venus, and others.

Pas de quatre  La Roseraie[edit]
In 2004, the teacher and choreographer Yuri Burlaka created a pas de quatre called La Roseraie for a student workshop of choreography at the Bolshoi Theatre.[8] The pas de quatre La Roseraie was based on themes from Marius Petipa's ballet Le Réveil de Flore with four ballerinas performing as the Greco-Roman deities Diana, Aurora, Hebe and Flora.[8] The choreography for the pas de quatre utilized notations for four variations found among the materials for the full-length Le Réveile de Flore in the Sergeyev Collection. The music was taken from the score for Le Réveil de Flore as well as from other works by Drigo.[8] Today the pas de quatre La Roseraie has become a popular piece with both ballet academies and professional companies across Russia, while its variations are frequently performed at ballet competitions.

The Rite of Spring[n 1] (French: Le Sacre du printemps) is a ballet and orchestral concert work by the Russian composer Igor Stravinsky. It was written for the 1913 Paris season of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company; the original choreography was by Vaslav Nijinsky with stage designs and costumes by Nicholas Roerich. When first performed at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées on 29 May 1913, the avant-garde nature of the music and choreography caused a sensation. Many have called the first-night reaction a ""riot"" or ""near-riot"", though this wording did not come about until reviews of later performances in 1924, over a decade later.[1] Although designed as a work for the stage, with specific passages accompanying characters and action, the music achieved equal if not greater recognition as a concert piece and is widely considered to be one of the most influential musical works of the 20th century.
Stravinsky was a young, virtually unknown composer when Diaghilev recruited him to create works for the Ballets Russes. Le Sacre du printemps was the third such major project, after the acclaimed Firebird (1910) and Petrushka (1911).[n 2] The concept behind The Rite of Spring, developed by Roerich from Stravinsky's outline idea, is suggested by its subtitle, ""Pictures of Pagan Russia in Two Parts""; the scenario depicts various primitive rituals celebrating the advent of spring, after which a young girl is chosen as a sacrificial victim and dances herself to death. After a mixed critical reception for its original run and a short London tour, the ballet was not performed again until the 1920s, when a version choreographed by Léonide Massine replaced Nijinsky's original, which saw only eight performances.[2] Massine's was the forerunner of many innovative productions directed by the world's leading choreographers, gaining the work worldwide acceptance. In the 1980s, Nijinsky's original choreography, long believed lost, was reconstructed by the Joffrey Ballet in Los Angeles.
Stravinsky's score contains many novel features for its time, including experiments in tonality, metre, rhythm, stress and dissonance. Analysts have noted in the score a significant grounding in Russian folk music, a relationship Stravinsky tended to deny. Regarded as among the first modernist works, the music influenced many of the 20th-century's leading composers and is one of the most recorded works in the classical repertoire.


Background[edit]
Igor Stravinsky was the son of Fyodor Stravinsky, the principal bass singer at the Imperial Opera, Saint Petersburg, and Anna, née Kholodovskaya, a competent amateur singer and pianist from an old-established Russian family. Fyodor's association with many of the leading figures in Russian music, including Rimsky-Korsakov, Borodin and Mussorgsky, meant that Igor grew up in an intensely musical home.[3] In 1901 Stravinsky began to study law at Saint Petersburg University while taking private lessons in harmony and counterpoint. Stravinsky worked under the guidance of Rimsky-Korsakov, having impressed him with some of his early compositional efforts. By the time of his mentor's death in 1908, Stravinsky had produced several works, among them a Piano Sonata in F♯ minor (1903–04), a Symphony in E♭ major (1907), which he catalogued as ""Opus 1"", and a short orchestral piece, Feu d'artifice (""Fireworks"", composed in 1908).[4][5]

Stravinsky, sketched by Picasso, 1920
In 1909 Feu d'artifice was performed at a concert in Saint Petersburg. Among those in the audience was the impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who at that time was planning to introduce Russian music and art to western audiences.[6] Like Stravinsky, Diaghilev had initially studied law, but had gravitated via journalism into the theatrical world.[7] In 1907 he began his theatrical career by presenting five concerts in Paris; in the following year he introduced Mussorgsky's opera Boris Godunov. In 1909, still in Paris, he launched the Ballets Russes, initially with Borodin's Polovtsian Dances from Prince Igor and Rimsky-Korsakov's Scheherazade. To present these works Diaghilev recruited the choreographer Michel Fokine, the designer Léon Bakst and the dancer Vaslav Nijinsky. Diaghilev's intention, however, was to produce new works in a distinctively 20th-century style, and he was looking for fresh compositional talent.[8] Having heard Feu d'artifice he approached Stravinsky, initially with a request for help in orchestrating music by Chopin to create new arrangements for the ballet Les Sylphides. Stravinsky worked on the opening Nocturne in A-flat major and the closing Grande valse brillante; his reward was a much bigger commission, to write the music for a new ballet, The Firebird (L'oiseau de feu) for the 1910 season.[6]
Stravinsky worked through the winter of 1909–10, in close association with Fokine who was choreographing The Firebird. During this period Stravinsky made the acquaintance of Nijinsky who, although not dancing in the ballet, was a keen observer of its development. Stravinsky was uncomplimentary when recording his first impressions of the dancer, observing that he seemed immature and gauche for his age (he was 21). On the other hand, Stravinsky found Diaghilev an inspiration, ""the very essence of a great personality"".[9] The Firebird was premiered on 25 June 1910, with Tamara Karsavina in the main role, and was a great public success.[10] This ensured that the Diaghilev–Stravinsky collaboration would continue, in the first instance with Petrushka (1911) and then The Rite of Spring.[6]

Synopsis and structure[edit]
In a note to the conductor Serge Koussevitzky in February 1914, Stravinsky described Le Sacre du printemps as ""a musical-choreographic work, [representing] pagan Russia ... unified by a single idea: the mystery and great surge of the creative power of Spring"". In his analysis of The Rite, Pieter van den Toorn writes that the work lacks a specific plot or narrative, and should be considered as a succession of choreographed episodes.[11]
The French titles are given in the form as written in the four-part piano score published in 1913. There have been numerous variants of the English translations; those shown are from the 1967 edition of the score.[11]

Creation[edit]
Conception[edit]
Sergei Diaghilev, director of the Ballets Russes from 1909 to 1929, as painted by Léon Bakst
Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is ""Yarila"" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: ""The likeness is too close to be coincidental"".[13][14] Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round.[15] However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: ""One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in Saint Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du printemps.""[16]
By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances.[17] The pair quickly agreed on a working title, ""The Great Sacrifice"" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva);[18] Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.[17]
In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet.[19] Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite premiere, suggests that the two-part pagan scenario that emerged was primarily devised by Roerich.[20] Stravinsky later explained to Nikolai Findeyzen, the editor of the Russian Musical Gazette, that the first part of the work would be called ""The Kiss of the Earth"", and would consist of games and ritual dances interrupted by a procession of sages, culminating in a frenzied dance as the people embraced the spring. Part Two, ""The Sacrifice"", would have a darker aspect; secret night games of maidens, leading to the choice of one for sacrifice and her eventual dance to the death before the sages.[17] The original working title was changed to ""Holy Spring"" (Russian: Vesna sviashchennaia), but the work became generally known by the French translation Le Sacre du printemps, or its English equivalent The Rite of Spring, with the subtitle ""Pictures of Pagan Russia"".[18][21]

Composition[edit]
First page from the handwritten score of Le Sacre du printemps
Stravinsky's sketchbooks show that after returning to his home at Ustilug in Ukraine in September 1911, he worked on two movements, the ""Augurs of Spring"" and the ""Spring Rounds"".[22] In October he left Ustilug for Clarens in Switzerland, where in a tiny and sparsely-furnished room—an 8-by-8-foot (2.4 by 2.4 m) closet, with only a muted upright piano, a table and two chairs[23]—he worked throughout the 1911–12 winter on the score.[24] By March 1912, according to the sketchbook chronology, Stravinsky had completed Part I and had drafted much of Part II.[22] He also prepared a two-hand piano version, subsequently lost,[24] which he may have used to demonstrate the work to Diaghilev and the Ballets Russes conductor Pierre Monteux in April 1912.[25] He also made a four-hand piano arrangement which became the first published version of Le Sacre; he and the composer Claude Debussy played the first half of this together, in June 1912.[24]
Following Diaghilev's decision to delay the premiere until 1913, Stravinsky put The Rite aside during the summer of 1912.[26] He enjoyed the Paris season, and accompanied Diaghilev to the Bayreuth Festival to attend a performance of Parsifal.[27] Stravinsky resumed work on The Rite in the autumn; the sketchbooks indicate that he had finished the outline of the final sacrificial dance on 17 November 1912.[22] During the remaining months of winter he worked on the full orchestral score, which he signed and dated as ""completed in Clarens, March 8, 1913"".[28] He showed the manuscript to Maurice Ravel, who was enthusiastic and predicted, in a letter to a friend, that the first performance of Le Sacre would be as important as the 1902 premiere of Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande.[29] After the orchestral rehearsals began in late March, Monteux drew the composer's attention to several passages which were causing problems: inaudible horns, a flute solo drowned out by brass and strings, and multiple problems with the balance among instruments in the brass section during fortissimo episodes.[28] Stravinsky amended these passages, and as late as April was still revising and rewriting the final bars of the ""Sacrificial Dance"". Revision of the score did not end with the version prepared for the 1913 premiere; rather, Stravinsky continued to make changes for the next 30 years or more. According to Van den Toorn, ""[n]o other work of Stravinsky's underwent such a series of post-premiere revisions"".[30]
Stravinsky acknowledged that the work's opening bassoon melody was derived from an anthology of Lithuanian folk songs,[31] but maintained that this was his only borrowing from such sources;[32] if other elements sounded like aboriginal folk music, he said, it was due to ""some unconscious 'folk' memory"".[33] However, Morton has identified several more melodies in Part I as having their origins in the Lithuanian collection.[34][35] More recently Richard Taruskin discovered in the score an adapted tune from one of Rimsky-Korsakov's ""One Hundred Russian National Songs"".[33][36] Taruskin notes the paradox whereby The Rite, generally acknowledged as the most revolutionary of the composer's early works, is in fact rooted in the traditions of Russian music.[37]

Realisation[edit]
Nijinsky in 1911, depicted by John Singer Sargent in costume for his role in Nikolai Tcherepnin's ballet Le Pavillon d'Armide
Taruskin has listed a number of sources that Roerich consulted when creating his designs. Among these are the Primary Chronicle, a 12th-century compendium of early pagan customs, and Alexander Afanasyev's study of peasant folklore and pagan prehistory.[38] The Princess Tenisheva's collection of costumes was an early source of inspiration.[17] When the designs were complete, Stravinsky expressed delight and declared them ""a real miracle"".[38]
Stravinsky's relationship with his other main collaborator, Nijinsky, was more complicated. Diaghilev had decided that
Nijinsky's genius as a dancer would translate into the role of choreographer and ballet master; he was not dissuaded when Nijinsky's first attempt at choreography, Debussy's L'après-midi d'un faune, caused controversy and near-scandal because of the dancer's novel stylised movements and his overtly sexual gesture at the work's end.[39][40] It is apparent from contemporary correspondence that, at least initially, Stravinsky viewed Nijinsky's talents as a choreographer with approval; a letter he sent to Findeyzen praises the dancer's ""passionate zeal and complete self-effacement"".[41] However, in his 1936 memoirs Stravinsky writes that the decision to employ Nijinsky in this role filled him with apprehension; although he admired Nijinsky as a dancer he had no confidence in him as a choreographer: ""the poor boy knew nothing of music. He could neither read it nor play any instrument"".[42][n 5] Later still, Stravinsky would ridicule Nijinsky's dancing maidens as ""knock-kneed and long-braided Lolitas"".[23]
Stravinsky's autobiographical account refers to many ""painful incidents"" between the choreographer and the dancers during the rehearsal period.[44] By the beginning of 1913, when Nijinsky was badly behind schedule, Stravinsky was warned by Diaghilev that ""unless you come here immediately ... the Sacre will not take place"". The problems were slowly overcome, and when the final rehearsals were held in May 1913, the dancers appeared to have mastered the work's difficulties. Even the Ballets Russes's sceptical stage director, Serge Grigoriev, was full of praise for the originality and dynamism of Nijinsky's choreography.[45]
The conductor Pierre Monteux had worked with Diaghilev since 1911 and had been in charge of the orchestra at the premiere of Petrushka. Monteux's first reaction to The Rite, after hearing Stravinsky play a piano version, was to leave the room and find a quiet corner. He drew Diaghilev aside and said he would never conduct music like that; Diaghilev managed to change his mind.[46] Although he would perform his duties with conscientious professionalism, he never came to enjoy the work; nearly fifty years after the premiere he told enquirers that he detested it.[47] In old age he said to Sir Thomas Beecham's biographer Charles Reid: ""I did not like Le Sacre then. I have conducted it fifty times since. I do not like it now"".[46] On 30 March Monteux informed Stravinsky of modifications he thought were necessary to the score, all of which the composer implemented.[48] The orchestra, drawn mainly from the Concerts Colonne in Paris, comprised 99 players, much larger than normally employed at the theatre, and had difficulty fitting into the orchestra pit.[49]
After the first part of the ballet received two full orchestral rehearsals in March, Monteux and the company departed to perform in Monte Carlo. Rehearsals resumed when they returned; the unusually large number of rehearsals—seventeen solely orchestral and five with the dancers—were fit into the fortnight before the opening, after Stravinsky's arrival in Paris on 13 May.[50] The music contained so many unusual note combinations that Monteux had to ask the musicians to stop interrupting when they thought they had found mistakes in the score, saying he would tell them if something was played incorrectly. According to Doris Monteux, ""The musicians thought it absolutely crazy"".[50] At one point—a climactic brass fortissimo—the orchestra broke into nervous laughter at the sound, causing Stravinsky to intervene angrily.[51][n 6]
The role of the sacrificial victim was to have been danced by Nijinsky's sister, Bronislava Nijinska; when she became pregnant during rehearsals, she was replaced by the then relatively unknown Maria Piltz.[43]

Paris's Théâtre des Champs-Élysées was a new structure, which had opened on 2 April 1913 with a programme celebrating the works of many of the leading composers of the day. The theatre's manager, Gabriel Astruc, was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season, and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25,000 francs per performance, double what he had paid the previous year.[53] The programme for 29 May 1913, as well as the Stravinsky premiere, included Les Sylphides, Weber's Le Spectre de la Rose and Borodin's Polovtsian Dances.[54] Ticket sales for the evening, ticket prices being doubled for a premiere, amounted to 35,000 francs.[55] A dress rehearsal was held in the presence of members of the press and assorted invited guests. According to Stravinsky, all went peacefully.[56] However, the critic of L'Écho de Paris, Adolphe Boschot, foresaw possible trouble; he wondered how the public would receive the work, and suggested that they might react badly if they thought they were being mocked.[57]
On the evening of 29 May, Gustav Linor reported, ""Never ... has the hall been so full, or so resplendent; the stairways and the corridors were crowded with spectators eager to see and to hear"".[58] The evening began with Les Sylphides, in which Nijinsky and Karsavina danced the main roles.[54] Le Sacre followed. Some eyewitnesses and commentators said that the disturbances in the audience began during the Introduction, and grew noisier when the curtain rose on the stamping dancers in ""Augurs of Spring"". But Taruskin asserts, ""it was not Stravinsky's music that did the shocking. It was the ugly earthbound lurching and stomping devised by Vaslav Nijinsky.""[59] Marie Rambert, who was working as an assistant to Nijinsky, recalled later that it was soon impossible to hear the music on the stage.[60] In his autobiography, Stravinsky writes that the derisive laughter that greeted the first bars of the Introduction disgusted him, and that he left the auditorium to watch the rest of the performance from the stage wings. The demonstrations, he says, grew into ""a terrific uproar"" which, along with the on-stage noises, drowned out the voice of Nijinsky who was shouting the step numbers to the dancers.[56] Two years after the premiere the journalist and photographer Carl Van Vechten claimed in his book Music After the Great War that the person behind him became carried away with excitement, and ""began to beat rhythmically on top of my head with his fists"".[61] In 1916, in a letter not published until 2013, Van Vechten admitted he had actually attended the second night, among other changes of fact.[62]

The New York Times reported the sensational premiere, nine days after the event.[63]
At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a ""Bohemian"" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would ""acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes"".[64] Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: ""Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on"". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final ""Sacrificial Dance"" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.[65]
Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic Henri Quittard, who called the work ""a laborious and puerile barbarity"" and added ""We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure"".[66] On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comœdia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely ""a rowdy debate"" between two ill-mannered factions.[67] Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: ""Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element"".[65] The composer Alfredo Casella thought that the demonstrations were aimed at Nijinsky's choreography rather than at the music,[68] a view shared by the critic Michel-Dimitri Calvocoressi, who wrote: ""The idea was excellent, but was not successfully carried out"". Calvocoressi failed to observe any direct hostility to the composer—unlike, he said, the premiere of Debussy's Pelléas et Mélisande in 1902.[69] Of later reports that the veteran composer Camille Saint-Saëns had stormed out of the premiere, Stravinsky observed that this was impossible; Saint-Saëns did not attend.[70][n 7] Stravinsky also rejected Cocteau's story that, after the performance, Stravinsky, Nijinsky, Diaghilev and Cocteau himself took a cab to the Bois de Boulogne where a tearful Diaghilev recited poems by Pushkin. Stravinsky merely recalled a celebratory dinner with Diaghilev and Nijinsky, at which the impresario expressed his entire satisfaction with the outcome.[72] To Maximilien Steinberg, a former fellow-pupil under Rimsky-Korsakov, Stravinsky wrote that Nijinsky's choreography had been ""incomparable: with the exception of a few places, everything was as I wanted it"".[41]

Initial run and early revivals[edit]
The premiere was followed by five further performances of Le Sacre du printemps at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, the last on 13 June. Although these occasions were relatively peaceful, something of the mood of the first night remained; the composer Giacomo Puccini, who attended the second performance on 2 June,[73][74] described the choreography as ridiculous and the music cacophonous—""the work of a madman. The public hissed, laughed—and applauded"".[75] Stravinsky, confined to his bed by typhoid fever,[76] did not join the company when it went to London for four performances at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane.[77] Reviewing the London production, The Times critic was impressed how different elements of the work came together to form a coherent whole, but was less enthusiastic about the music itself, opining that Stravinsky had entirely sacrificed melody and harmony for rhythm: ""If M. Stravinsky had wished to be really primitive, he would have been wise to ... score his ballet for nothing but drums"".[78] The ballet historian Cyril Beaumont commented on the ""slow, uncouth movements"" of the dancers, finding these ""in complete opposition to the traditions of classical ballet"".[61]

Léonide Massine, who choreographed the 1920 revival
After the opening Paris run and the London performances, events conspired to prevent further stagings of the ballet. Nijinsky's choreography, which Kelly describes as ""so striking, so outrageous, so frail as to its preservation"", did not appear again until attempts were made to reconstruct it in the 1980s.[65] On 19 September 1913 Nijinsky married Romola de Pulszky while the Ballets Russes was on tour without Diaghilev in South America. When Diaghilev found out he was distraught and furious that his lover had married, and dismissed Nijinsky. Diaghilev was then obliged to re-hire Fokine, who had resigned in 1912 because Nijinsky had been asked to choreograph Faune. Fokine made it a condition of his re-employment that none of Nijinsky's choreography would be performed.[79] In a letter to the art critic and historian Alexandre Benois, Stravinsky wrote, ""[T]he possibility has gone for some time of seeing anything valuable in the field of dance and, still more important, of again seeing this offspring of mine"".[80]
With the disruption following the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 and the dispersal of many artistes, Diaghilev was ready to re-engage Nijinsky as both dancer and choreographer, but Nijinsky had been placed under house arrest in Hungary as an enemy Russian citizen. Diaghilev negotiated his release in 1916 for a tour in the United States, but the dancer's mental health steadily declined and he took no further part in professional ballet after 1917.[81] In 1920, when Diaghilev decided to revive The Rite, he found that no one now remembered the choreography.[82] After spending most of the war years in Switzerland, and becoming a permanent exile from his homeland after the 1917 Russian Revolution, Stravinsky resumed his partnership with Diaghilev when the war ended. In December 1920 Ernest Ansermet conducted a new production in Paris, choreographed by Léonide Massine, with the Nicholas Roerich designs retained; the lead dancer was Lydia Sokolova.[61] In his memoirs, Stravinsky is equivocal about the Massine production; the young choreographer, he writes, showed ""unquestionable talent"", but there was something ""forced and artificial"" in his choreography, which lacked the necessary organic relationship with the music.[83] Sokolova, in her later account, recalled some of the tensions surrounding the production, with Stravinsky, ""wearing an expression that would have frightened a hundred Chosen Virgins, pranc[ing] up and down the centre aisle"" while Ansermet rehearsed the orchestra.[84]

Later choreographies[edit]
The ballet was first shown in the United States on 11 April 1930, when Massine's 1920 version was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra in Philadelphia under Leopold Stokowski, with Martha Graham dancing the role of the Chosen One.[85] The production moved to New York, where Massine was relieved to find the audiences receptive, a sign, he thought, that New Yorkers were finally beginning to take ballet seriously.[86] The first American-designed production, in 1937, was that of the modern dance exponent Lester Horton, whose version replaced the original pagan Russian setting with a Wild West background and the use of Native American dances.[86]

The Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, where the 1965 production of The Rite was described by a critic as ""Soviet propaganda at its best""
In 1944 Massine began a new collaboration with Roerich, who before his death in 1947 completed a number of sketches for a new production which Massine brought to fruition at La Scala in Milan in 1948.[85] This heralded a number of significant post-war European productions. Mary Wigman in Berlin (1957) followed Horton in highlighting the erotic aspects of virgin sacrifice, as did Maurice Béjart in Brussels (1959). Béjart's representation replaced the culminating sacrifice with a depiction of what the critic Robert Johnson describes as ""ceremonial coitus"".[86] The Royal Ballet's 1962 production, choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan and designed by Sidney Nolan, was first performed on 3 May and was a critical triumph. It has remained in the company's repertoire for more than 50 years; after its revival in May 2011 The Daily Telegraph's critic Mark Monahan called it one of the Royal Ballet's greatest achievements.[87] Moscow first saw The Rite in 1965, in a version choreographed for the Bolshoi Ballet by Natalia Kasatkina and Vladimir Vasiliev. This production was shown in Leningrad four years later, at the Maly Opera Theatre,[88] and introduced a storyline that provided the Chosen One with a lover who wreaks vengeance on the elders after the sacrifice. Johnson describes the production as ""a product of state atheism ... Soviet propaganda at its best"".[86]

Tanztheater Wuppertal in Pina Bausch's production
In 1975 modern dance choreographer Pina Bausch, who transformed the Ballett der Wuppertaler Bühnen to Tanztheater Wuppertal, caused a stir in the dance world with her stark depiction, played out on an earth-covered stage, in which the Chosen One is sacrificed to gratify the misogyny of the surrounding men.[89][90][91] At the end, according to The Guardian's Luke Jennings, ""the cast is sweat-streaked, filthy and audibly panting"".[89] Part of this dance appears in the film Pina.[86] Bausch's version had also been danced by two ballet companies, the Paris Opera Ballet and English National Ballet.[92][93] In America, in 1980, Paul Taylor used Stravinsky's four-hand piano version of the score as the background for a scenario based on child murder and gangster film images.[86] In February 1984 Martha Graham, in her 90th year, resumed her association with The Rite by choreographing a new production at New York State Theater.[94] The New York Times critic declared the performance ""a triumph ... totally elemental, as primal in expression of basic emotion as any tribal ceremony, as hauntingly staged in its deliberate bleakness as it is rich in implicatio"

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The Rite of Spring is a one-act ballet created by Kenneth MacMillan in 1962 for the Royal Ballet, set to Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring (1913).  The conductor was Colin Davis, and the designs were by Sidney Nolan.
The first performance was given at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 3 May 1962. The central role of the Chosen One was danced by Monica Mason who continued to tale the part in revivals up to 1982. Mason supervised later revivals, in which the Chosen One was danced by, among others, Tamara Rojo (2005 and 2008), Mara Galeazzi (2005), Zenaida Yanowsky (2005), Steven McRae (2011) and Edward Watson (2011).[1]


Background[edit]
MacMillan had been invited to create a new production of The Rite of Spring for the Royal Ballet in 1959, but had declined.[2] The company had little history of presenting Stravinsky ballets, with the exceptions of Ashton's Le baiser de la fée (1935) and Scènes de ballet (1948), and MacMillan's Dances concertantes (1955), Agon (1958) and Le baiser de la fée (1961).[3] MacMillan took The Rite up in 1962, creating a work conspicuously removed from the Royal Ballet's classical tradition. His conception of the piece, supported by Sidney Nolan's designs, was what the commentator Stephanie Jordan calls ""a generalized primitivism"".[3]
The scenario generally follows that of the original 1913 ballet, with minor changes such as the replacement of the Sage with three Elders, and bringing two key plot points forward in the action: the selection of the chosen one and the start of her sacrificial dance.[4]

Premiere[edit]
The premiere took place on Friday 3 May 1962 at Covent Garden. Notable audience members included Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother and Princess Margaret.[5]

Critical reception[edit]
Early reviews were mixed but generally positive; The Guardian concluded that the Royal Ballet had ""made a brave musicianly and tasteful attempt""  while questioning whether ""the stage can really be its home – that remains unproven"";[6] dance and dancers described it as ""a singular and signal triumph""; Mason's performance was judged ""brilliantly done"", ""one of British ballet's most memorable performances"".[7] In The Times John Percival commented that ever since Nijinsky's original attempt in 1913 The Rite had been waiting for a choreographer who could make it work on stage, and MacMillan's was the most successful version to date: ""Mr MacMillan's invention can never have been more musical or assured. Time and time again Stravinsky's music, unaffectedly conducted by Mr Colin Davis, meets its match, as the choreography, with its blend of primitivism and modern jive, piles climax on climax.""[8]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


This article is about Balanchine's 1980 ballet. For Robert Schumann’s music to which the ballet was made, see Davidsbündlertänze.

Robert Schumann’s “Davidsbündlertänze” is one of the last major works made by New York City Ballet's founding choreographer and balletmaster-in-chief, George Balanchine. It is set to Robert Schumann's Davidsbündlertänze (Dances of the League of David),[1] Op. 6 (1837). The idea for setting this piano work very likely came from a work created by Robert Joffrey for his own Joffrey Ballet Company, the premier of which took place at the City Center Theater in the late 1970s. Joffrey, in turn, received his inspiration from Jonathan Watts, a protege of Joffrey's and director of the Joffrey apprentice company, who, at the suggestion of pianist Neil Stannard, created a ballet titled Evening Dialogues to this same score. This initial version of the Schumann cycle was featured on tour with the Joffrey second company in the mid 1970a.
The premiere took place on June 19, 1980, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center. A series of dances for four couples, the ballet draws on the life of Schumann, in particular his reunion with Clara Wieck after a 16-month estrangement in the year of its composition.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Robin Hood is a ballet created by choreographer and artistic director Paul Vasterling for the Nashville Ballet in 1998.[1] The full-length ballet is in two acts and contains the music of Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Although Korngold wrote music to the 1938 movie The Adventures of Robin Hood, no music from the film is used in the ballet. Korngold’s early chamber music is used, as well as his Theme and Variations, Op. 42, and movements from both his Symphony in F-sharp major and Violin Concerto. The suite Much Ado About Nothing is used extensively in both acts and concludes the ballet.

Rodeo is a ballet composed by Aaron Copland and choreographed by Agnes de Mille, which premiered in 1942. Subtitled ""The Courting at Burnt Ranch"", the ballet consists of five sections: ""Buckaroo Holiday"", ""Corral Nocturne"", ""Ranch House Party"", ""Saturday Night Waltz"", and ""Hoe-Down"". The symphonic version omits ""Ranch House Party"", leaving the other sections relatively intact.


Genesis[edit]
The original ballet was choreographed by Agnes de Mille for the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo, a dance company that moved to the United States during World War II. In order to compete with the rival company Ballet Theatre, the Ballet Russe commissioned de Mille out of a career of relative obscurity. The choreographer was given considerable creative control, choosing Aaron Copland as the composer after being impressed by his previous ballet, Billy the Kid. Though Copland was initially reluctant to compose ""another Cowboy ballet,"" De Mille persuaded him that this show would mark a significant departure from his previous work. As de Mille found herself occupied with instructing a highly international cast in the mannerisms of American cowboys, Copland recommended that Oliver Smith design the sets,[1] in what would prove to be a prescient action.
De Mille herself played the lead, and the premiere at the Metropolitan Opera House on 16 October 1942 received 22 curtain calls. The other principal dancers in the cast included Frederic Franklin and Casimir Kokitch. Though de Mille herself was not entirely pleased with the premiere, it was attended by Rodgers and Hammerstein, who approached de Mille afterward to request that she choreograph their upcoming production of Oklahoma!.[1]
The ballet makes use of riding movements that de Mille devised with the assistance of Peggy van Praagh, for a recital in London by Peggy van Praagh and Hugh Laing in 1938. De Mille also made use of such vernacular forms as a square dance and a cadenza for a tap dancer.
Noted among many reviews was de Mille's highly evocative choreography, described as ""film sensibility""[1] and renowned for its realism. The original production went on to lead a successful tour, though producers were hard pressed to replicate the skill with which de Mille had portrayed the lead. De Mille retained veto power over any casting of the ballet, which often sent companies to extremes in order to find a worthy Cowgirl. Meanwhile, Copland arranged the music as a symphonic suite for orchestra titled Four Dance Episodes from Rodeo, which consisted chiefly of removing ""Ranch House Party"" and minor adjustments to the final two sections. With the middle section removed, the composition resembled the symphonic form with an ambitious opening movement, slow movement, minuet and finale. In this form, Rodeo found even greater success, premiering at the Boston Pops in 1943.

Structure and analysis[edit]
The circumstances surrounding the composition of Rodeo led to its having a number of features that set it apart from other Copland compositions. Though many of Copland's works incorporate traditional American folk tunes, Rodeo is unique in that it leaves them quite intact in the score, with very little alteration on the part of the composer. This is likely attributable in part to De Mille's control over the work. Indeed, she had already blocked the entire show before Copland had written a single note[1] and also transcribed several folk tunes, including ""Old Paint"", for Copland in addition to her blocking notes.
The well-known main theme of ""Hoe-Down"" is based on a unique version of the American folk song ""Bonyparte"" or ""Bonaparte's Retreat,"" played by Salyersville, Kentucky fiddler William Hamilton Stepp, which was recorded in 1937 by Alan Lomax for the Library of Congress.[2] A meticulous transcription by Ruth Crawford Seeger of that performance appeared in Lomax's 1941 book, ""Our Singing Country"".
Many of the themes were autobiographical for De Mille. An extremely skilled dancer, the choreographer nonetheless felt awkward in the offstage world, and the Cowgirl's unwillingness to subscribe to traditional gender roles mirrors De Mille's experience.[1]

Buckaroo Holiday[edit]

Rodeo opens with a grand fanfare, vamping until R5-6, where the woodwinds introduce the Cowgirl's theme.  This quiet theme continues until the Rodeo theme begins presenting a highly rhythmic motif that evokes the trotting of horses. The lone Cowgirl seeks the affections of the Head Wrangler, who is rather taken with the more feminine Rancher's Daughter.  The cowboys enter to the railroad tune of ""Sis Joe"", envisioned by de Mille as an event ""like thunder,"" which Copland obliges with heavy drums and brass. As the cowgirl seeks the attention of her quarry, she mimics the surrounding cowboys, reflected in the heavy use of the tune ""If He'd Be a Buckaroo"" in this section. The theme is repeated by various solo instruments before being realized in triple canon by the full orchestra. After a brief return to the quiet Cowgirl theme, the fanfare returns. ""Sis Joe"" reappears again, before the entire orchestra triumphantly plays ""If He'd be a Buckaroo"".

Corral Nocturne[edit]




""Corral Nocturne""

The ""Corral Nocturne"" invokes the lovesick musings of the Cowgirl, portrayed rather lyrically by Copland's heavy use of oboe and bassoon. In writing this scene, de Mille noted that ""She run[s] through the empty corrals intoxicated with space, her feet thudding in the stillness.""[3] The Head Wrangler discovers her in the darkness, but she does not come toward him as the Rancher's Daughter would. Confused, he exits with the Rancher's Daughter.

Ranch House Party[edit]
The subsequent ""Ranch House Party"" (ballet only) was envisioned by de Mille as ""Dance music inside. Night music outside."" Indeed, the section (written by Leonard Bernstein on behalf of an overworked Copland) opens with a honky-tonk theme played on a piano, accompanied by a more thoughtful clarinet. The Cowgirl finds herself between the Champion Roper and the Wrangler, who are attracted to the Rancher's Daughter. ""Corral Nocturne"" is recalled at the end of this section, as the Cowgirl finds herself quite alone.[3]

Saturday Night Waltz[edit]




""Saturday Night Waltz""

A 16 second sample of ""Saturday Night Waltz"" demonstrating the subtle use of single woodwind instruments over a bed of strings to represent the characters.

While the ""Texas minuet"" of the ""Saturday Night Waltz"" plays de Mille's transcribed version of ""I Ride an Old Paint"" (also known as ""Houlihan"") the cowboys and their girls pair off. Expectant of a partner and finding none, the Cowgirl is alone until the Champion Roper approaches her, having failed to best the Wrangler in winning the affections of the Rancher's Daughter. Both this section and the ""Corral Nocturne"" feature Copland's characteristic economy of sound, where he uses solo instruments in lieu of entire sections.

Hoe-Down[edit]




""Hoe-Down""

A 20 second sample of ""Hoe-Down"" demonstrating the main theme of the movement with the horns providing counterpoint to the main string melody.

Finally, the ""Hoe-Down"" opens by vamping the first bar of William Hamilton Stepp's interpretation of the folk tune ""Bonaparte's Retreat"", which will become a major theme of the section. After a reprisal of the Rodeo theme, the theme proper begins in the strings, as the horns play a simple counterpoint. Instead of building to a climax, this section segues into ""Miss McLeod's Reel"", performed by various solo instruments.  Copland briefly introduces the Irish theme ""Gilderoy"" in the clarinet and oboe.[3]
Building toward the end, Copland reintroduces ""Bonaparte's Retreat"" in canon, before returning to the Rodeo theme, which slows into the climactic kiss between the Cowgirl and the Roper. ""Bonaparte's Retreat"" is then resumed by the full orchestra, which ends the piece with a grand fanfare.


Ballet and its place in the repertoire[edit]

In what is considered one of the earliest examples of a truly American ballet, Rodeo combines the exuberance of a Broadway musical with the disciplines of classical ballet. Of particular note, the first scene requires men to pantomime riding and roping while dancing solo and dancing in groups (not very common for male ballet dancers), and while interacting with an awkward Cowgirl, who seeks their acceptance. The cast dresses in stylized western garb, which makes it all the more difficult to execute many of the moves.
Classical ballet storylines typically involve some boy-meets-girl relationship, or at most a love triangle. But Rodeo forces an American Cowgirl to compete against an army of local girls in a quest to win the attention of the Champion Roper. The pairing and mutual attraction of the men and women in the cast appears fluid, and at times confusing to the rejected Cowgirl. Against this backdrop, the Cowgirl emotes strength, awkwardness, confidence, femininity and vulnerability, while executing rapid-fire footwork and pantomime, which mimics the bronco-busting of the men. Any comic dancer who plays the Cowgirl must succeed at being a failure, only to emerge triumphant in the end when she finally dons a dress for dance night.
Regarding this nuanced role, DeMille said: ""She acts like a boy, not to be a boy, but to be liked by the boys.""
The American Ballet Notes for its 1950 premiere performance (Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden, Germany) state: Rodeo ... is a love story of the American Southwest. The problem it deals with is perennial: how an American girl, with the odds seemingly all against her, sets out to get herself a man. The girl in this case is a cowgirl, a tomboy whose desperate efforts to become one of the ranch's cowhands create a problem for the cowboys and make her the laughingstock of womankind.
As noted above, finding suitable Cowgirls to play this role was a challenge. Lucia Chase recalls that when the Ballet Theater Company had exclusive rights to stage Rodeo, Agnes DeMille urged the employment of ""charming and talented comediennes from the Broadway musical stage"" for the role. In the ballet world, DeMille's favorites for the role were: Dorothy Etheridge (Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo), Jenny Workman (The Ballet Theater Company), Carole Valleskey (Joffrey Ballet), Bonnie Wyckoff (Boston Ballet) and Christine Sarry (American Ballet Theatre).
In the 1970s, Christine Sarry emerged as DeMille's preferred interpreter of this complex role, DeMille even preferring Sarry's version to her own. Agnes DeMille stated in her will that only Sarry was authorized to approve of dancers who could take up the role of the Cowgirl. Since Agnes DeMille's death, Sarry has coached and approved numerous dancers in the part. In the 21st century, the list includes: Tina LeBlanc (San Francisco Ballet, 2006), Kristin Long (San Francisco Ballet, 2007); Xiomara Reyes (American Ballet Theatre, 2006); Marian Butler (American Ballet Theatre, 2006); and Erica Cornejo (American Ballet Theatre, 2005). Of Ms. Cornejo, critic Jerry Hochman wrote, ""Cornejo owns the role now"".
Up to 1979, Rodeo was staged mainly by deMille and Vernon Lusby, for many years one of her most trusted assistants on numerous projects. When illness precluded his ability to continue setting Rodeo in 1981, deMille asked Paul Sutherland, a former principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet, and Harkness Ballet who had danced leading roles in several of her ballets, to begin staging Rodeo. With the passing of Agnes deMille in 1993, ownership and all rights to Rodeo passed to her son, Jonathan Prude. For the next several years, several people staged the ballet. In 1999, Prude set up the deMille Committee to oversee her numerous works and assigned sole responsibility for staging Rodeo to Sutherland, including the selection of dancers, rehearsals and stage production. With the exception of a few companies to whom Agnes deMille had, years before, given the ballet in perpetuity, Sutherland has staged Rodeo over fifty times for dozens of companies and universities throughout the United States and Canada as well as in Antwerp, Belgium, and continues to do so.
For a point of comparison, it has been nearly 120 years since the premiere of The Nutcracker, and more than 70 years since the premiere of Rodeo. This increasing longevity, plus the anchoring of Copland's score in American culture, suggests near-certain permanence for the ballet.

Progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer recorded a version of ""Hoe-Down"" (with the title changed slightly to ""Hoedown"") for their 1972 album Trilogy. In a review of Trilogy, François Couture of AllMusic called ELP's version of ""Hoedown"" a ""crowd-pleaser"".[5]
Another version of the ""Hoe-Down"" section was also later recorded by folk rock and jazz group Béla Fleck and the Flecktones.
At Bob Dylan's performances during his ""Never-Ending Tour"", he is introduced by his stage manager reading a short biography with ""Hoe-Down"" playing in the background.
Television appearances of ""Hoe-Down"" include its use as the background theme for the ""Beef. It's What's for Dinner"" advertising campaign in the 1990s, and The Simpsons episode ""The Seemingly Never-Ending Story"". 
""Hoe-Down"" served as the basis for the soundtrack cue ""In Training"" from the film An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, composed by James Horner.[6] A further adaptation appears in the film Titanic during the below-decks Irish dancing scene, again composed by Horner.
""Hoe-Down"" accompanied one of the choreographed opening ceremony performances of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.

The problem it deals with is perennial: how an American girl, with the odds seemingly all against her, sets out to get herself a man. The girl in this case is a cowgirl, a tomboy whose desperate efforts to become one of the ranch's cowhands create a problem for the cowboys and make her the laughingstock of womankind.
As noted above, finding suitable Cowgirls to play this role was a challenge. Lucia Chase recalls that when the Ballet Theater Company had exclusive rights to stage Rodeo, Agnes DeMille urged the employment of ""charming and talented comediennes from the Broadway musical stage"" for the role. In the ballet world, DeMille's favorites for the role were: Dorothy Etheridge (Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo), Jenny Workman (The Ballet Theater Company), Carole Valleskey (Joffrey Ballet), Bonnie Wyckoff (Boston Ballet) and Christine Sarry (American Ballet Theatre).
In the 1970s, Christine Sarry emerged as DeMille's preferred interpreter of this complex role, DeMille even preferring Sarry's version to her own. Agnes DeMille stated in her will that only Sarry was authorized to approve of dancers who could take up the role of the Cowgirl. Since Agnes DeMille's death, Sarry has coached and approved numerous dancers in the part. In the 21st century, the list includes: Tina LeBlanc (San Francisco Ballet, 2006), Kristin Long (San Francisco Ballet, 2007); Xiomara Reyes (American Ballet Theatre, 2006); Marian Butler (American Ballet Theatre, 2006); and Erica Cornejo (American Ballet Theatre, 2005). Of Ms. Cornejo, critic Jerry Hochman wrote, ""Cornejo owns the role now"".
Up to 1979, Rodeo was staged mainly by deMille and Vernon Lusby, for many years one of her most trusted assistants on numerous projects. When illness precluded his ability to continue setting Rodeo in 1981, deMille asked Paul Sutherland, a former principal dancer with American Ballet Theatre, Joffrey Ballet, and Harkness Ballet who had danced leading roles in several of her ballets, to begin staging Rodeo. With the passing of Agnes deMille in 1993, ownership and all rights to Rodeo passed to her son, Jonathan Prude. For the next several years, several people staged the ballet. In 1999, Prude set up the deMille Committee to oversee her numerous works and assigned sole responsibility for staging Rodeo to Sutherland, including the selection of dancers, rehearsals and stage production. With the exception of a few companies to whom Agnes deMille had, years before, given the ballet in perpetuity, Sutherland has staged Rodeo over fifty times for dozens of companies and universities throughout the United States and Canada as well as in Antwerp, Belgium, and continues to do so.
For a point of comparison, it has been nearly 120 years since the premiere of The Nutcracker, and more than 70 years since the premiere of Rodeo. This increasing longevity, plus the anchoring of Copland's score in American culture, suggests near-certain permanence for the ballet.

""Hoedown"" (1972)

""Jerusalem"" (1973)

Progressive rock band Emerson, Lake & Palmer recorded a version of ""Hoe-Down"" (with the title changed slightly to ""Hoedown"") for their 1972 album Trilogy. In a review of Trilogy, François Couture of AllMusic called ELP's version of ""Hoedown"" a ""crowd-pleaser"".[5]
Another version of the ""Hoe-Down"" section was also later recorded by folk rock and jazz group Béla Fleck and the Flecktones.
At Bob Dylan's performances during his ""Never-Ending Tour"", he is introduced by his stage manager reading a short biography with ""Hoe-Down"" playing in the background.
Television appearances of ""Hoe-Down"" include its use as the background theme for the ""Beef. It's What's for Dinner"" advertising campaign in the 1990s, and The Simpsons episode ""The Seemingly Never-Ending Story"". 
""Hoe-Down"" served as the basis for the soundtrack cue ""In Training"" from the film An American Tail: Fievel Goes West, composed by James Horner.[6] A further adaptation appears in the film Titanic during the below-decks Irish dancing scene, again composed by Horner.
""Hoe-Down"" accompanied one of the choreographed opening ceremony performances of the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah.

Romeo and Juliet (Russian: Ромео и Джульетта, romanized: Romeo i Dzhulyetta), Op. 64, is a ballet by Sergei Prokofiev based on William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. First composed in 1935, it was substantially revised for its Soviet premiere in early 1940. Prokofiev made from the ballet three orchestral suites and a suite for solo piano.


Background and premiere[edit]
Based on a synopsis created by Adrian Piotrovsky (who first suggested the subject to Prokofiev)[1] and Sergey Radlov, the ballet was composed by Prokofiev in September 1935 to their scenario which followed the precepts of ""drambalet"" (dramatised ballet, officially promoted at the Kirov Ballet to replace works based primarily on choreographic display and innovation).[2] Following Radlov's acrimonious resignation from the Kirov in June 1934, a new agreement was signed with the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow on the understanding that Piotrovsky would remain involved.[3]
However, the ballet's original happy ending (contrary to Shakespeare) provoked controversy among Soviet cultural officials.[4] The ballet's production was then postponed indefinitely when the staff of the Bolshoi was overhauled at the behest of the chairman of the Committee on Arts Affairs, Platon Kerzhentsev.[5] The ballet's failure to be produced in the Soviet Union until 1940 may also have been a result of consequences in the performing arts following Pravda's denunciation of Dmitri Shostakovich in 1936, as well as other ""degenerate modernists"" including Piotrovsky.[6] The conductor Yuri Fayer met with Prokofiev frequently during the writing of the music, and he strongly urged the composer to revert to the traditional ending. Fayer went on to conduct the first performance of the ballet at the Bolshoi Theatre.
Suites of the ballet music were heard in Moscow and the United States, but the full ballet premiered in the Mahen Theatre, Brno (then in Czechoslovakia, now in the Czech Republic), on 30 December 1938.[7] This version was a single-act production with music mainly from the first two suites. Prokofiev was not able to attend the premiere due to his status of outbound restriction.
The history of the creation of the ballet was recited by the composer Sergei Prokofiev himself:

At the end of December (of 1934) I returned to Leningrad specifically for the negotiations with the Kirov Theatre. I expressed my wish to find a lyrical scenario for a ballet… We started recalling the scenarios: Piotrovsky named ""Pelléas and Méllisande"", ""Tristan and Isolde"", ""Romeo and Juliet"". I immediately ""clung"" onto the latter – it would be impossible to find a better one! It was arranged that Piotrovsky, Radlov and I (S.P.) would be making a libretto. It was decided to engage as a producer Rostislav Zakharov – a former student of Radlov… However, we didn't conclude a contract with the Kirov Theatre… I arrived in Moscow, and Golovanov, the then chief conductor of the Bolshoi Theatre said that if this was about ""Romeo"" the Bolshoi theatre would immediately conclude a contract with me. The contract was signed in the summer of 1935. The theatre gave me the opportunity to work on the ballet in ""Polenovo"" – the holiday home of the Bolshoi theatre, where I managed to almost finish the ballet using themes composed in the spring. An audition of the ballet took place in the theatre. It had no success. The ballet was not put on the stage at that time… Yet it was staged in the Kirov Theatre in 1939 (1940). R. Zakharov dropped out after the ballet had been rejected by the Bolshoi theatre. Lavrovsky, on the other hand, during the staging of the ballet in Leningrad, added quite a lot to what had been composed before him. Later I decided to include him in the co-authors of the libretto.[8]
1940 Kirov production[edit]
Galina Ulanova and Yuri Zhdanov in the ballet
It is better known today from the significantly revised version that was first presented at the Kirov Theatre (now Mariinsky Theatre) in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) on 11 January 1940, with choreography by Leonid Lavrovsky and with Galina Ulanova and Konstantin Sergeyev in the leading roles. Despite the objections of Prokofiev, Lavrovsky significantly changed the score of the ballet. This production received international acclaim and was awarded the Stalin Prize.
In 1955, Mosfilm made the film version of this production with Galina Ulanova as Juliet and Yuri Zhdanov as Romeo. This film won the Best Lyrical Film and nominated as Palme d'Or in the 1955 Cannes Film Festival.
Original Cast

Galina Ulanova, Juliet

Revivals and other productions[edit]
In 1955, Frederick Ashton choreographed a production of Romeo and Juliet for the Royal Danish Ballet.
In 1962, John Cranko's choreography of Romeo and Juliet for the Stuttgart Ballet helped the company achieve a worldwide reputation. It had its American premiere in 1969.
In 1965, choreographer Sir Kenneth MacMillan's version for the Royal Ballet premiered at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev danced the title roles. Fonteyn, considered to be near retirement, embarked upon a rejuvenated career with a partnership with Nureyev. Also in 1965, Oleg Vinogradov stages a version in Russia while serving as assistant ballet master to Pyotr Gusev.
In 1971, John Neumeier, partly inspired by John Cranko, created another version of the ballet in Frankfurt. In 1974, Neumeier's Romeo and Juliet premiered in Hamburg as his first full-length ballet with the company.
In 1977, Rudolf Nureyev created a new version of Romeo and Juliet for the London Festival Ballet, today's English National Ballet. He performed the lead role of Romeo with British ballerinas Eva Evdokimova and Patricia Ruanne creating the role of Juliet.  As a partnership, they toured the production internationally. Eva Evdokimova danced the leading role Juliet in London and Paris, and it continues to be a popular ballet in the ENB repertoire, with its most recent revival in 2010 staged by Patricia Ruanne and Frederic Jahn of the original 1977 cast. This production was also staged by La Scala Theater Ballet in 1980 and Paris Opera Ballet in 1984 and has been a renowned performance in the POB repertoire.
In 1979, Yuri Grigorovich created a new version for the Bolshoi, ""which did away with most of the stage properties and stylized the action into an all-danced text."" This was revived in 2010 and remains in the Bolshoi repertory.[9]

A 2010 production at the Royal Swedish Opera
In 1985, choreographer László Seregi's production premiered at the Hungarian National Ballet, Budapest.
In 1990, director Armondo Linus Acosta used Prokofiev's score, performed by the London Symphony Orchestra, to create a motion picture adaptation of Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet. Acosta's Romeo.Juliet was conceived as a film-in-concert with a live orchestra performing the soundtrack, and was performed as such to international acclaim with by conductors such as André Previn, Barry Wordsworth, and Nicholas Cleobury.[citation needed]

A 2014 Krzysztof Pastor's production at the Polish National Ballet, dancers: Vladimir Yaroshenko and Maria Żuk
In 1991, Christopher Gable directed his own production for the Northern Ballet Theatre. It was choreographed by Massimo Moricone and featured William Walker as Romeo and Jayne Regan as Juliet.
In 1996, choreographer Jean-Christophe Maillot premiered his version of Roméo et Juliette at Les Ballets de Monte Carlo. Taking formal inspiration from the episodic character of Sergei Prokofiev's classic score, Maillot structured the action in a manner akin to cinematic narrative. Rather than focusing on themes of political-social opposition between the two feuding clans, this Romeo and Juliet highlights the dualities and ambiguities of adolescence.
In 2007, Peter Martins made Romeo + Juliet on New York City Ballet to the Prokofiev music.
In 2008, Krzysztof Pastor presented his version by the Scottish Ballet at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre. The Polish premiere of this version was by the Polish National Ballet in Warsaw, and the United States premiere was by the Joffrey Ballet in 2014.
On July 4, 2008, with the approval of the Prokofiev family and permission from the Russian State Archive, the original Prokofiev score was given its world premiere. Musicologist Simon Morrison, author of The People's Artist: Prokofiev's Soviet Years, unearthed the original materials in the Moscow archives, obtained permissions, and reconstructed the entire score. Mark Morris created the choreography for the production. The Mark Morris Dance Group premiered the work at the Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College in New York state. The production subsequently began a year-long tour to include Berkeley, Norfolk, London, New York, and Chicago.
In 2011, the National Ballet of Canada premiered a new choreography of Romeo and Juliet by Alexei Ratmansky in Toronto, with plans to take it on tour in Western Canada in early 2012.
Also in 2011, Graeme Murphy created his version of Romeo and Juliet for The Australian Ballet.[10]
In 2015, Stanton Welch premiered his version of Romeo and Juliet for Houston Ballet.
In 2019 at the Curve Theatre, Leicester Matthew Bourne choreographed an alternative adaptation of Romeo and Juliet set in a mental hospital called 'Verona Institute'. It was filmed with Cordelia Braithwaite as Juliet, Paris Fitzpatrick as Romeo and Dan Wright as Tybalt.

Score[edit]
Instrumentation[edit]
In addition to a somewhat standard instrumentation, the ballet also requires the use of the tenor saxophone.  This voice adds a unique sound to the orchestra as it is used both in solo and as part of the ensemble.

Recordings[edit]
Sergei Prokofiev himself made the first recording of music from the ballet, with the Moscow Philharmonic Orchestra in 1938.  Since then, there have been recordings of the full score, as well as various excerpts such as the orchestral suites the composer prepared. Leopold Stokowski conducted the NBC Symphony Orchestra in a rare stereo recording in 1954. Gennady Rozhdestvensky and the Symphony Orchestra of the Bolshoi Theatre recorded the full score in 1959. André Previn with the London Symphony Orchestra and Lorin Maazel with the Cleveland Orchestra both made recordings of the complete score in 1973. Michael Tilson Thomas conducted the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra in 1995, in selections from the score, for RCA Victor. Georg Solti conducted the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in a recording coupled with the Classical Symphony. Valery Gergiev made two recordings, with the Kirov Orchestra in 1990 and with the London Symphony Orchestra in 2011.

1965 ballet by Kenneth MacMillan
This article is about the MacMillan ballet to Prokofiev's score. For John Cranko's ballet, see Romeo and Juliet (Cranko). For Rudolf Nureyev's ballet, see Romeo and Juliet (Nureyev). For Sean Lavery's setting of the balcony scene, see Romeo and Juliet (Lavery). For Peter Martins' ballet, see Romeo + Juliet (ballet). For other uses, see Romeo and Juliet (disambiguation).

Choreographer Sir Kenneth MacMillan's Royal Ballet production of Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet premiered at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 9 February 1965.


Background[edit]
Kenneth MacMillan had previously choreographed the balcony scene for Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable to dance in September 1964 for Canadian Television.[1] This scene provided an essential part of the ballet's overall structure. Seymour stated that the balcony scene pas de deux only took three rehearsals to fully choreograph.[2] This experience made him seem a good candidate to choreograph the entire ballet for Covent Garden, when the Soviet Union refused to allow Leonid Lavrovsky's classic production to tour to London.[3] MacMillan prepared his version with the blessing of Frederick Ashton.[4] MacMillan only had five months to choreograph the full ballet as The Royal Ballet hoped to perform Romeo and Juliet in its upcoming American tour. He, Seymour, and Gable planned the ballet around the characters and their pas de deuxs. They envisioned Juliet as the headstrong character, making decisions, while Romeo was ""swept off his feet by love"".
Nicholas Georgiadis designed the set and costumes with specific intent regarding the characters and feel of the performance. The imposing, large set designs were utilized to emphasize how small and vulnerable Juliet was in comparison and position her and Romeo as helpless against the society they live in. MacMillan and Georgiadias were inspired by Italian Quattrocento paintings and architecture; Shakespeare, and Franco Zeffirelli's 1960 Romeo and Juliet production. MacMillan also took inspiration from Cranko's Romeo and Juliet to include the rowdy harlots in the market scenes.[5]

Premiere performance[edit]
Kenneth MacMillan's Royal Ballet production of Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet premiered at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 9 February 1965.[6] Though MacMillan had conceived the ballet for Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable, for  ""bureaucratic reasons"" Margot Fonteyn and Rudolph Nureyev danced the opening night, to MacMillan's disappointment.[7] The casting change was disheartening not only to MacMillan, but to the entire company, contributing to MacMillan and Seymour's eventual move away from the Royal Ballet and Gable's transition away from dancing entirely.[8] Mainly, Fonteyn and Nureyev were given the leading roles because of their fame and box office draw. The impresario for the American tour, Sol Hurok said that the ballet would only be included and profitable in the US if Fonteyn and Nureyev were given the title roles.[9] Fonteyn and Nureyev brought new life to the characters, as did the set and costume designs by Nicholas Georgiadis; Fonteyn, considered to be near retirement, embarked upon a rejuvenated career with a partnership with Nureyev. Lynn Seymour left the Royal Ballet for three years after this slight to dance with the German Opera Ballet in West Berlin, but she returned in 1970 to dance many principal roles.[10]

Response[edit]
The first production of Romeo and Juliet was met with overwhelmingly positive critical and box office response. Fonteyn and Nureyev received 43 curtain calls, eventually needing the safety curtain to descend in order to encourage the audience to leave the theater. Critics agreed across the board that the ballet was a fantastic addition to the Royal Ballet's repertoire as well as an accomplishment for MacMillan. The Observer, The Daily Mail, and the Sunday Telegraph were a few of the magazines and papers to review the performance. Andrew Porter with The Financial Times, who was the first critic to discuss the last minute casting change, noted that the ballet could not be fully understood until Seymour performed the role designed for her.[11]

Following performances[edit]
Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable danced the lead roles in the second cast, also receiving rave reviews, though not the same level of overt audience appreciation.  They were followed by three other pairings in the first tour and many more throughout the decades since.
The first five performances of Romeo and Juliet have remained highly lauded by critics. Alastair Macaulay spoke of Fonteyn and Nureyev's performance as ""If there was a single moment in my life that turned me into a ballet obsessive, that was it"". In the New York Times in 2007. He also lauded Seymour's rebellious Juliet.[12]
Romeo and Juliet has become a staple of the Royal Ballet's Repertoire. MacMillan went on to restage the ballet for other companies around the world such as The Royal Swedish Ballet, American Ballet Theatre, and the Birmingham Royal Ballet. The Birmingham Royal Ballet also included a new set and costume design by Paul Andrews.[13]

Film[edit]
The production was filmed by Paul Czinner and received a cinematic release in 1966. The star-studded first cast with Fonteyn and Nureyev performed.[14]
The film was one of a series of movies financed between Rank and the NFFC.[15] It received some strong reviews but was a box office disappointment.[16]
Since then it has been live streamed and recorded multiple times, the most recent of which being the 2012 filmed production of the ballet starring Lauren Cuthbertson and Federico Bonelli, filmed by Ross MacGibbon.[17] A 90-minute abridgment by writer-producers (and dancers) Michael Nunn and William Trevitt for BBC television was broadcast in 2020 on PBS Great Performances.[18]

1977 ballet by Rudolf Nureyev

Rudolf Nureyev's production of Sergei Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet premiered at the London Coliseum on 2 June 1977.


Background and premiere[edit]
Rudolf Nureyev had previously danced as the leading role in Kenneth MacMillan's production of the ballet at the Royal Ballet, Covent Garden in 1965. In 1977, Nureyev left the Royal Ballet and created his own production of the ballet for London Festival Ballet to celebrate the Queen's Silver Jubilee.[1][2][3] This production premiered at the London Coliseum on 2 June 1977, with the British ballerina Patricia Ruanne as Juliet and Rudolf as Romeo. This production is still in the English National Ballet's repertoire.[2]
This production was later staged for the La Scala Theatre Ballet and the first night took place on 20 December 1980, with Carla Fracci as Juliet and the choreographer as Romeo.[4] This production was filmed in 1983 and broadcast in Italy and Britain, with the participation of Margot Fonteyn as Lady Capulet.[5]
In 1984, this production was introduced to Paris Opera Ballet with Monique Loudières and Patrick Dupond as the leading roles.[4] The production was filmed and released in DVD format in 1995, featuring Loudières as Juliet and Manuel Legris as Romeo.

2008 ballet by Krzysztof Pastor
""Romeo and Juliet"" performed by Polish National Ballet, Warsaw

Romeo and Juliet is a 2008 ballet choreographed by Krzysztof Pastor based on William Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet. Pastor's three-act version is set to the same score used in the Prokofiev version of the ballet. The libretto is by Pastor and Willem Bruls.[1]


Synopsis[edit]
Vladimir Yaroshenko and Maria Żuk as Romeo and Juliet, Polish National Ballet, Warsaw
The ballet is recast as a contemporary political statement set in three Italian political eras of the 20th century. Act I is set in Italy in the 1930s, during the reign of Benito Mussolini and the emergence of Fascism.[2] (1935 was the year in which Prokofiev composed the original score.[3]) Act II takes place in the 1950s, amid the rise of the Red Brigades and political terrorism.[2] Act III is set in the 1990s during Silvio Berlusconi's tenure of social unrest, which serves as the backdrop for the climatic tragedy.[2] The content of the three acts mirrors the contemporary Italian eras. In the first act, paralleling the rise of Fascism, the upper-class Capulet family is depicted with ""stiff, militaristic movement"", while the lower-class Montegue family is characterized by ""loose, flowing motions laced with pedestrian naturalism"".[2] In the second act, paralleling the Red Brigades era of political terrorism, the romance of Romeo and Juliet is dogged by interfamilial feuding and conflict. In the third act, paralleling the ""social divisions"" of the Berlusconi era, the lovers meet their tragic fate.[2] The work is accompanied by a ""multimedia video backdrop"".[4]

Performances[edit]
The ballet was premiered by the Scottish Ballet in 2008 at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre.[5][6] Following its debut, it toured the United Kingdom in 2010,[7] and in the weeks prior to its United States premiere it was performed in the Grand Theatre by the Polish National Ballet.[1] Its United States premiere will be by the Joffrey Ballet at Auditorium Theatre with music performed by the Chicago Philharmonic Orchestra in 2014. The Joffrey had previously performed Cranko's adaptation of Prokofiev multiple times as early as 1984,[8] when it gave the Prokofiev score its United States debut.[3] In 2014, there was also an encore UK touring production that visited Inverness, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, London and Glasgow.[7]

Ballet choreographed by Kyle Abraham


The RunawayChoreographerKyle AbrahamMusicNico MuhlyJames BlakeJay-ZKanye WestPremiereSeptember 27, 2018 (2018-09-27)David H. Koch TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignGiles DeaconGenrecontemporary ballet
The Runaway is a one-act contemporary ballet choreographed by Kyle Abraham, to music by Nico Muhly, James Blake, Jay-Z and Kanye West, and costumes designed by Giles Deacon. The ballet premiered on September 27, 2018, at the David H. Koch Theater, performed by the New York City Ballet. It is Abraham's first piece for a ballet company, and made him the first black choreographer to work with the company in over a decade.


Production[edit]
Background[edit]
The Runaway was one of the first commissions by the New York City Ballet's new interim leadership team, which was formed after ballet master-in-chief Peter Martins left the company due to sexual assault allegations against him.[1] One of the team's members, Justin Peck contacted choreographer Kyle Abraham to make a piece for the company.[2] Jonathan Stafford, another interim leader, said the success of Peck's The Times Are Racing led the team to look for some unorthodox choices in programming.[1]
The commission was a ""shock"" for Abraham, because he was already accomplished in contemporary dance, and as he recalled, ""I was in the lowest of the lowest ballet classes you could be in.""[1] Though it was Abraham's first piece for a ballet company, he had previously worked with former New York City Ballet principal dancer Wendy Whelan on her Restless Creature project.[1] With this ballet, Abraham became the first black choreographer to work with the company since Albert Evans in 2005. Shortly after the commission was announced, Abraham said in an interview, ""I have a fear that if this piece is seen as a failure, they will never hire another black choreographer again.""[3]

Development[edit]
Abraham, who only saw the company perform a handful of times, worked with interim leader Rebecca Krohn on casting and sought out dancers who would be ""open to someone who isn’t necessarily going to walk in the room with steps ready for them.""[2][3] He asked for black women in the cast, but it was not possible as other choreographers had made the same request.[2]
Normally, he would make a piece over the course of a year, but this time he was given three weeks.[3] He said he believed some would expect him to ""make a hip-hop dance"" due to his race, and noted it was ""tricky"" for him as he would ""love the opportunity to make a classic ballet"" but also wanted to make a piece that ""infuses a whole other energy and vibe in the space,""[2] and not a ""canned version of ballet with an urban zhoozh.""[1] In the final product, hip-hop was one of the influences of the ballet.[1] Abraham had never choreographed on pointe shoes before but decided to use them for this ballet.[1][3]
Abraham considered using classical music, but opted for Nico Muhly, James Blake, Jay-Z and Kanye West. Muhly is a contemporary classical composer, a contrast to other songs.[1][4] The costumes were designed by Giles Deacon.[1]

Premiere[edit]
The Runaway had its premiere on September 27, 2018, at the New York City Ballet fall fashion gala,[1] with dancers Ashley Bouder, Jonathan Fahoury, Sara Mearns, Roman Mejia, Georgina Pazcoguin, Taylor Stanley, Sebastian Villarini-Velez and Peter Walker.[5] Two days later, Kanye West made a pro-Donald Trump speech on Saturday Night Live, and Abraham addressed the issue on social media.[6]

Music[edit]
The Runaway is set to music by Nico Muhly, James Blake, Jay-Z and Kanye West, including:[7]


Quiet Music from Three Etudes
Part I: Material in Eb and Part II: Material in Sevenths from Drones & Violin
Part III: The 8th Tune from Drones & Piano
""Don't Miss It""
""Gotta Have It""
""I Am a God""
""I Love Kanye""
""I Thought About Killing You""
""Next Lifetime""
""Ni**as in Paris""
""POWER""
Critical reception[edit]
Apollinaire Scherr of the Financial Times gave it five stars, called it ""a paragon of outsider infiltration, stretching and revealing the givens of ballet, including how it peoples the stage,"" and noted ""it was fitting that the first post-Martins commission went to Kyle Abraham.""[8] The New York Times's Alastair Macaulay commented that the ballet is ""patchy, hybrid, flawed and often sensational"". He praised the choreography of solos with Stanley, but criticized the female parts for looking ""like mere fashion accessories.""[4] Siobhan Burke added The Runaway in the New York Times's ""Best Dance of 2018,"" while Macaulay mentioned it when he included the fall fashion gala on the list.[6] Stanley's performance was singled out by the critics. Dance Magazine's Jennifer Stahl wrote that Stanley was the first dancer she saw to ""bleed neoclassical technique into a mix of street and contemporary styles so masterfully.""[9] He won a Bessie Award for his performance.[10]

Ballet by Mark Morris


Sandpaper BalletChoreographerMark MorrisMusicLeroy AndersonPremiereApril 27, 1999 (1999-04-27)War Memorial Opera HouseOriginal ballet companySan Francisco BalletDesignIsaac MizrahiJames F. Ingalls
Sandpaper Ballet is a ballet choreographed by Mark Morris to music by Leroy Anderson. It was created for the San Francisco Ballet, and premiered on April 27, 1999, at the War Memorial Opera House.[1]


Production[edit]
Choreography[edit]
Mark Morris's Sandpaper Ballet was created for the San Francisco Ballet.[2] Tina Fehlandt, a frequent collaborator of Morris who had staged the ballet, said Morris ""loves ballet, and he uses ballet vocabulary [...] But he likes to use it in a different way."" She noted that this ballet is ""very classical.""[3] The ballet is performed by sixteen women and nine men. Fehlandt said Morris deliberately used an odd number of dancers as a challenge as he ""loves spacial patterns and moving large groups of people around"" and ""wanted to challenge himself.""[3] She also said Morris wants the dancers to be individualistic, ""so there's not a sense they're performing at you. Although, that said, if you didn't feel good on a particular day he'd want you to pretend.""[3]

Music[edit]
The ballet is set to music by Leroy Anderson, who was associated with the Boston Pops Orchestra.[4] All eleven scores used by Anderson are three to four minutes long,[5] though ""Sleigh Ride"" is used as an overture.[6] and ""Sandpaper Ballet"", from which the title of the ballet is taken, is not featured.[5] It was Morris' first piece with a full orchestra,[3] and he called the music ""little gems; one-liners that really show off the band.""[7]

Designs[edit]
Isaac Mizrahi designed the costumes, with the dancers in blue and white tops, lime green unitards and gloves, plus skirts for women.[2][6] James F. Ingalls designed the lighting.[2]

Performances[edit]
Sandpaper Ballet had its premiere on April 27, 1999[1] at the War Memorial Opera House, conducted by Emil de Cou.[2] The company had since revived the ballet, most recently in 2020.[6] The company will release a video recording of the full ballet online in 2021 as a part of their digital season, which will be held in lieu of the premiere of a new Morris ballet and the 2021 repertory season, both of which had to be cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the San Francisco Bay Area.[8]
The Houston Ballet performed the ballet in 2005, staged by Fehlandt, and Morris completed the final touches.[3]

Original cast[edit]
The ballet is performed by 25 dancers. The original cast includes:[2]

Evelyn Cisneros
Stephen Legate
Julia Adam
Julie Diana
Joanna Berman
Yuri Possokhov
Music[edit]
All the music used in Sandpaper Ballet were composed by Leroy Anderson, including:[1]

Critical reception[edit]
Following the premiere, Octavio Roca of SFGate called Sandpaper Ballet ""the hit of the evening,"" and commented, ""Morris giddily ignores the lines between principal dancer and corps, and he has designed dance patterns that make each dancer look his or her best.""[2] In 2002, Anna Kisselgoff of the New York Times commented, ""It looks funny, but its geometric formations are choreographed with dead seriousness [...] The steps look occasionally messy in the solos and trios but the formations look great, especially when someone is inevitably out of line.""[4]

The Sanguine FanBallet score by Edward Elgar""A Fan in Sanguine"" by Charles ConderOpus81
The Sanguine Fan, Op. 81, is a single-act ballet written by Edward Elgar in 1917. It was composed to raise money for wartime charities, and after two performances in 1917 and a recording of excerpts in 1920, the score was neglected until 1973, when the conductor Sir Adrian Boult revived it for a recording. It was later staged in the theatre by the London Festival Ballet.


Background and first performance[edit]
Elgar's close friend and confidante, Alice Stuart-Wortley (Lady Stuart of Wortley) asked him to compose the music for a one-act ballet to be given at a fund-raising performance in aid of war charities in March 1917.[1] Elgar agreed and wrote the music quickly: within a fortnight he had a complete short score and began the full orchestration.[2]

Ina Lowther wrote the story of the ballet.
The scenario was by Ina Lowther (later the founder of the ballet course at the Royal College of Music).[1] Her inspiration came from a decorative fan painted by Charles Conder using mostly the dark red colour sanguine used in heraldry. The fan depicted a glade with on one side the mythical figures of Echo and Pan and on the other mortals in 18th-century costume.[3] Lowther devised a story in which the mortals dance among the trees before one of the men quarrels with his lover and, as they draw apart, he curses the god of love before becoming fascinated by Echo. Pan wakes, strikes the man dead and runs off into the trees with Echo, laughing sardonically as the dead man's lover kneels in grief over his body.[4]
For the charity performance leading West End actors took the main roles: Gerald du Maurier played Pan and the two lovers were played by Fay Compton and Ernest Thesiger;[5] Lowther played Echo.[4] The first performance was part of the revue Chelsea on Tiptoe at the Chelsea Palace Theatre, London on 20 March 1917, and was conducted by the composer. Afterwards he added a further number, a shepherd's dance, which received its premiere at a second charity performance in May.[5]

Music[edit]
The score, which plays for a little under 20 minutes, is in nine continuous sections:  

Moderato–maestoso
Andantino
Piu moderato
Allegro molto
Grandioso
Allegretto moderato
Allegro
Allegro
Moderato
Recordings[edit]
Elgar conducted parts of the score for an acoustic recording in 1920, and apart from the publication of a piano arrangement of a single number, ""Echo's Dance"", the work was thereafter neglected for more than fifty years. In 1973 Elgar's score was unearthed and the conductor Sir Adrian Boult agreed to record it for EMI with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.[6] Further recordings followed, conducted by Bryden Thomson (1988), David Lloyd-Jones (1998) and John Wilson (2012).[7]

1976 ballet[edit]
In September 1976, at the instigation of its director, Beryl Grey, the London Festival Ballet revived the score, with a new scenario and choreography by Ronald Hynd. It was set at an Edwardian soirée in Carlton House Terrace during which twin brothers become involved in a mix-up with two elegant ladies, one of whom suspects her sanguine-coloured fan has been stolen by the other.[8] Some of the performances were conducted by Boult, whose last public appearance was conducting a performance on 24 June 1978.[9]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Scènes de ballet is a suite of dance movements composed in 1944 by Igor Stravinsky.  It was commissioned by Broadway producer Billy Rose for inclusion in the revue The Seven Lively Arts that opened at the Ziegfeld Theater on December 7, 1944.[1]
The Seven Lively Arts brought together a number of notable performers:  Beatrice Lillie, Bert Lahr, Benny Goodman, and ""Doc"" Rockwell as well as showgirls – ""the prettiest around at the moment,"" according to The New York Times review.[2]
The solo dancers for the Scènes de ballet were Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin (who was also the choreographer).[3]  Although Rose had requested a 15-minute work, ""the music was cut to a fraction of its original length when The Seven Lively Arts ... opened in New York.""[4]


Music[edit]
Scènes de ballet is a score of between 16 and 18 minutes duration, written in 1944. It was commissioned by Billy Rose for a Broadway revue. The music occasioned one of the best-known Stravinsky anecdotes. Rose telegraphed Stravinsky: ""YOUR MUSIC GREAT SUCCESS STOP COULD BE SENSATIONAL SUCCESS IF YOU WOULD AUTHORISE ROBERT RUSSELL BENNETT RETOUCH ORCHESTRATION STOP BENNETT ORCHESTRATES EVEN THE WORKS OF COLE PORTER."" To which Stravinsky telegraphed back: ""SATISFIED WITH GREAT SUCCESS.""[5]
The score is in nine sections. The timings are those of the composer's 1963 recording.[6]

Introduction 0:52
Danses (Corps de ballet & Ballerina) 4:34
Pantomime 2:08
Pas de deux 2:49
Pantomime 0:31
Variations (Danseur & Ballerina) 2:24
Pantomime 0:27
Danses (Corps de ballet) 1:03
Apothéose 2:12
Reception[edit]
On 8 December 1944, Lewis Nichols wrote a generally favorable review of the show, although he observed:  ""Markova and Dolin also have a couple of numbers, one to Stravinsky music, which probably is not the best they ever have done.""
Stravinsky himself later observed:  ""Scènes de ballet is a period piece, a portrait of Broadway in the last years of the War.  It is featherweight and sugared—my sweet tooth was not yet carious, then—but I will not deprecate it, not even the second Pantomime, and all of it is at least well made.""[7]

1948 English ballet

Scènes de balletChoreographerFrederick AshtonMusicIgor StravinskyPremiere11 February 1948Royal Opera House, LondonOriginal ballet companySadler's Wells BalletSettingParisCreated forMargot FonteynGenreNeoclassical balletTypeclassical ballet
Scènes de ballet is a one-act ballet choreographed by Frederick Ashton, who created it during 1947–1948 to Igor Stravinsky's eponymous music from 1944. The first performance was given by the Sadler's Wells Ballet, at the Royal Opera House, London.


Creation, choreography and design[edit]
Ashton's choreography is along classical lines, in the tradition of Marius Petipa's 19th-century works. Instead of Petipa's symmetry, however, Ashton used a system of Euclidean geometry, with geometric theorems adapted to serve as floor patterns for the dancers. As a result, the ballet is unusual in that it makes sense from all angles, as Ashton himself explained, ""I wanted to do a ballet that could be seen from any angle – anywhere could be front, so to speak. So I did these geometric figures that are not always facing front – if you saw Scènes de ballet from the wings, you'd get a very different but equally good picture.""[1]
The ballet was originally designed by André Beaurepaire, a young Frenchman who was heavily influenced by Picasso. His collaboration with Ashton was not an easy one, given the choreographer's wish for what Parry calls ""Baroque Parisian fantasy"". Eventually, two sets were agreed upon: a green-grey viaduct that was supposed to give way, at the apotheosis, to a white pavilion made up of guns, bones, and limbs. In the event this proved impractical, and since the ballet's second performance the viaduct has been used on its own, although at the premiere Ashton went with the pavilion. Nor were Beaurepaire's designs for the costumes quite to Ashton's liking: though the choreographer retained his designer's hats, bracelets and chokers he discarded the men's hats and altered the colour of the tights from blue-gray to pink. Pearls and diamonds were added to the women's costumes, while the men's costumes were simplified. The prima ballerina was given a colour combination of yellow and black to suit Margot Fonteyn.[2]

Critical reception[edit]
Initially, Scènes de ballet divided critical opinion. The Times commented that it ""had the one merit of brevity"";[4] Richard Buckle in The Observer wrote, ""The only fault …  is that it is not the last act of a long classical ballet. Such a display of noble movement should be the culmination of a spectacle: yet before we realise its beauty this pearl of great price has dissolved – in eighteen minutes.""[5] Ashton's own description of the ballet was,""It has a distant, uncompromising beauty which says I am here, beautiful, but I will make no effort to charm you.""[6] In 2004 Debra Crain called the work ""pure classicism at its most invigorating.""[7]

Recording[edit]
A performance of Scènes de ballet by the Royal Ballet from December 2010, featuring Miyako Yoshida, Ivan Putrov, Edward Watson and Lauren Cuthbertson has been issued on DVD by Opus Arte, as part of an all Ashton programme.

This article is about the Wheeldon ballet. For Frederick Ashton's 1947–48 ballet, see Scènes de ballet (Ashton).
Scénes de ballet was performed with students from the School of American Ballet and choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon to Stravinsky's eponymous music from 1944. It was Wheeldon's second work for the New York City Ballet. The premiere took place on Wednesday, May 19, 1999, at the New York State Theater with a set designed by Ian Falconer and costumes designed by Holly Hynes. For the ballet, Falconer created a Russian ballet studio, bisected by a ""real"" barre and an imaginary mirror. Sixty-two ballet students ranging from the very young to those in their last year of study were cast, some as ""real"" dancers and others as their ""reflection"" in the ""mirror"".

Scherzo à la Russe is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Stravinsky's music of the same name. The ballet was created for New York City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival, a tribute to the composer after his death, and premiered on June 21, 1972, at the New York State Theater, with the two lead roles originated by Karin von Aroldingen and Kay Mazzo.


Production[edit]
Stravinsky and Balanchine collaborated for many years until the former's death in 1971.[1] The latter then decided to have the New York City Ballet hold the week-long Stravinsky Festival to honor the composer.[2]: 286  There were at least 20 premieres,[1] seven of which were choreographed by Balanchine.[3]: 317 
One of the ballets made for the festival is set to Scherzo à la Russe, which Stravinsky wrote in 1925, for a film project that was abandoned.[4] The four-minute long ballet is performed by an all-female cast, with two principal dancers and a corps de ballet of sixteen. Karin von Aroldingen and Kay Mazzo originated the two lead roles.[2]: 296  The choreography resembles Russian folk dance. Von Aroldingen described, ""You feel like a child or a doll when you do it. The whole thing is a smile. It's over so fast. That surprise short ending – it just stops dead – shows Stravinsky's humor.""[2]: 296 
The costumes were designed by Karinska, with the dancers in white Russian style dresses and crown-like headdress. The original lighting was designed by Ronald Bates.[2]: 296  The choreography of the ballet was revised in 1982.[5]

Performances[edit]
Scherzo à la Russe premiered on June 21, 1972, at the New York State Theater.[3]: 415 [4] In addition to the New York City Ballet, the ballet had also been performed by students of the School of American Ballet.[6]

Critical reception[edit]
Following the premiere, New York Times critic Clive Barnes commented that the ballet ""is a slight joke but warm one."" He added, ""Balanchine has taken this easy, almost succulent music, and made, slightly irreverently, the kind of Nursemaids’ Dance that he feels that Fokine should have contributed to Petrushka. It is brief, clever and lightly betwitching.""[4]

1921-22 ballet by Richard Strauss
Richard Strauss conducting Schlagobers, photo by Erich Salomon
Schlagobers (Whipped Cream), Op. 70, is a ballet in two acts with a libretto and score by Richard Strauss. Composed in 1921–22, it was given its première at the Vienna State Opera on 9 May 1924.[1]


Background[edit]
While serving as co-director of the Vienna State Opera with Franz Schalk from 1919 until 1924, Strauss sought to revive the fortunes of the resident ballet company, struggling after the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy. He recruited choreographer Heinrich Kröller (1880–1930) from the Berlin State Opera and collaborated with him on a series of productions, restaging his earlier work for the Ballets Russes Josephslegende (1922), and rearranging the music of Schumann, François Couperin, Beethoven, and Gluck for, respectively, Karneval (1922), Ballettsoirée (1923), Die Ruinen von Athen (1924), and Don Juan (1924). Most ambitious was Schlagobers, premiered during the official celebrations for the composer's sixtieth birthday.[2]

Scenario[edit]
A group of children celebrate their confirmation in a Konditorei (a Viennese cake shop), where many of the confections come alive, with marzipan marches and chocolate dances. Having overindulged, one boy falls ill and hallucinates, leading to the party of Princess Pralinée, a trio of amorous liqueurs, and a riot of cakes pacified by beer.[3]
The scenario is somewhat reminiscent of The Nutcracker, which remained unperformed in the West until 1929.[4]

Music[edit]
Strauss' score employs a thematic-developmental treatment of motifs and was, according to contemporary critic Julius Korngold, ""too elaborately artistic, too massive and heavily developed, and not dancerly enough... The light whipped cream is whisked in a gaudy bowl.""[5][6]

Premiere[edit]
Kröller's choreography may be partially reconstructed from surviving drawings and dance notation, while sketches of many of the 287 costumes and sets created by the house designers have survived.[7] The extravagance of the production, costing some four billion Kronen – a contemporary new staging of Wagner's Rienzi cost by contrast only two hundred million – led to it being dubbed the Milliardenballett or ""billionaire's ballet"", and at a time of food-shortages and hyperinflation, may in part explain its troubled reception.[8] Strauss observed, in response to the poor reviews, ""I cannot bear the tragedy of the present time. I want to create joy.""[9]

Political subtext[edit]
While in the final version the three amorous liquors are Marianne Chartreuse, Ladislaw Slivovitz, and Boris Wutki, representatives of France, Poland and Russia, the original intent was to have the German Michel Schnapps instead winning Marianne's hand, a symbol of political reconciliation or even resurgent German virility, written out after the Occupation of the Ruhr. Also in earlier sketches, red banners were waved amidst the riotous proletarian cakes, with the Revolution Polka conducted by matzos.[10][11]

Recordings[edit]
There is a recording of the full ballet by the Tokyo Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Hiroshi Wakasugi.[12]
The composer also recorded the waltzes from the ballet with the Vienna Philharmonic.

Other productions[edit]
The American Ballet Theatre mounted their first production of the ballet in 2017 at the Metropolitan Opera in New York City; Alexei Ratmansky provided the choreography and Mark Ryden designed set and costumes.[13] That production was also shown at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC,[14] and at the Hong Kong Arts Festival.[15]

Scotch SymphonyChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicFelix MendelssohnPremiereNovember 11, 1952 (1952-11-11)City Center of Music and DramaOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignKarinskaDavid FfolkesHorace ArmisteadJean Rosenthal
Scotch Symphony is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3, ""Scottish"". The ballet is inspired by Scotland, and evokes the style of the romantic ballet era, particularly La Sylphide, which is set in Scotland. Scotch Symphony was made for the New York City Ballet, and premiered on November 11, 1952, at the City Center of Music and Drama.


Choreography[edit]
The program for Scotch Symphony stated, Balanchine [like Mendelssohn] wishes to evoke the sweep and freshness, the brilliance and strength inherent in the Highland landscape. He has invented a classic ballet based on atmosphere and music, with an affectionate nod to the romantic tradition that made the hero of La Sylphide a Highlander.[1]
The ballet is set to Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3, ""Scottish"".[1] Dance critic Richard Buckle described Scotch Symphony as ""one of those Balanchine ballets ... that hover between romance and comedy or pastiche.""[2] Author Nancy Reynolds wrote, ""Choreographically, the ballet contains many steps, gestures and poses allusive of the romantic era.""[1] She also noted the lead ballerina role ""requires a high level of technique tempered by lightness, grace, and the quality of an otherworldly vision.""[1] Dancer Patricia Wilde noted that Balanchine asked the dancers to be on their toes to emulate Scottish highland dancing.[3]
The first movement features a girl and boys, all in kilts, along with a pas de trois and a solo for the girl.[2][4] The second movement is an adagio danced by a ballerina and her partner. Though it is plotless, Balanchine wrote that it ""represents ... the general mood and atmosphere of the romantic ballet as epitomized in such ballets as La Sylphide.""[2] The third and final movement features the lead couple and the ensemble, in which the two lead dancers perform a pas de deux and variations, before the soloists and corps de ballet join them for the finale.[4][5]

Development[edit]
In August 1952, while the New York City Ballet was performing at Edinburgh Festival, towards the end of the company's first European tour, George Balanchine attended the Searchlight Tattoo.[2][3][5] Having enjoyed both the military tattoo and his visit to Scotland, and inspired by bagpipe and Scottish highland dance performances, Balanchine decided to make a Scottish-themed ballet.[3][5] Development of the ballet began after the company returned to New York.[5] He chose to set the ballet to  Mendelssohn's Symphony No. 3, also inspired by a visit to Scotland, but removed the first movement, which Balanchine found to be ""not appropriate for dance.""[5] He also decided to evoke La Sylphide, ""the first great romantic ballet"", which features a Scottish setting.[5]
Maria Tallchief and André Eglevsky originated the two lead roles,[4] while Patricia Wilde created the female role in the first movement, along Frank Hobi and Michael Maule as the two other dancers in the pas de trois.[6] While working on the ballet, Balanchine and Tallchief were in the process of having their marriage annulled, though it had little impact on their artistic collaborations.[7] Though Tallchief was known for her dazzling dancing style, her role in this ballet required more light and graceful techniques.[1][2] Wilde believed that in emulating Scottish highland dance, the dancers became prone to injuries, including ""terrible calf cramps and shin splints.""[6]
Karinska designed the women's costumes while David Ffolkes designed the men's. Horace Armistead and Jean Rosenthal designed the set and lighting respectively.[1]

Performances[edit]
Scotch Symphony premiered on November 11, 1952, at the City Center of Music and Drama.[1][4]
In 1989, Scotch Symphony, along with Theme and Variations, became the first Balanchine ballets performed by the Kirov Ballet in St. Petersburg, where he had danced in the 1920s as a student and young professional dancer before leaving for the West.[8]
Other ballet companies that performed the ballet include the San Francisco Ballet,[9] Washington Ballet,[10] Joffrey Ballet,[11] Pennsylvania Ballet,[12] Atlanta Ballet[13] and Kansas City Ballet.[14] Students of the School of American Ballet, the associate school of the New York City Ballet, performed the ballet as part of its annual workshop performance.[15]

Ballet choreographed by Marius Petipa and with music by Alexander Glazunov
This article is about the Petipa-Glazunov ballet. For Jerome Robbins' ballet, see The Four Seasons (ballet). For the Cunningham-Cage ballet, see The Seasons (Cage). For other uses, see The Seasons (disambiguation).
Anna Pavlova in the Bacchante, St. Petersburg, 1907.
The Seasons (Russian: Времена года, Vremena goda; also French: Les Saisons) is an allegorical ballet in one act, four scenes, by the choreographer Marius Petipa, with music by Alexander Glazunov, his Op. 67. The work was composed in 1899 and first performed by the Imperial Ballet on 26 February [O.S. 13 February] 1900 in St. Petersburg, Russia.


History[edit]
Composition history[edit]
The score for Marius Petipa's Les Saisons (The Seasons) was originally intended to have been composed by the Italian composer and conductor Riccardo Drigo, who was Glazunov's colleague and close friend. Since 1886, Drigo held the posts of director of music and chef d’orchestre to the Ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, while also serving as conductor for performances of the Italian operas in the repertory of the Imperial Opera. Petipa's Les Millions d’Arlequin (also known as Harlequinade) was also in its preliminary stages at the same time as Les Saisons, and was originally intended to have had a score supplied by Glazunov. Since Drigo and Glazunov had an affinity towards each other's assigned ballet, the two composers agreed that Glazunov would compose Les Saisons and that Drigo would compose Les Millions d’Arlequin.
Petipa's Les Millions d'Arlequin was presented for the first time at the Imperial Theatre of the Hermitage on 23 February [O.S. 10 February] 1900. Les Saisons premiered three days later. For both performances the whole of the Imperial court was in attendance.
In 1907, Nikolai Legat staged a revival of Les Saisons at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre. This production was performed on occasion by the Imperial Ballet after the Russian Revolution, being performed for the last time in 1927.
Les Saisons lived on in an abridged edition in the repertory of Anna Pavlova's touring company.

Synopsis[edit]
Marie Petipa and Pavel Gerdt in the Bacchanale of the scene L'Automne. (St. Petersburg, 1900)
Tableau 1 — A winter landscape
Winter is surrounded by his companions: Hoar-frost, Ice, Hail and Snow, who amuse themselves with a band of snowflakes. Two gnomes enter, and soon light a fire that causes all assembled to vanish.
Tableau 2 — A landscape covered with flowers
Spring dances with Zephyr, flower fairies, and enchanted birds. Upon feeling the heat of the sun, the assembly takes flight.
Tableau 3 — A landscape of flowing fields of wheat
Cornflowers and poppies revel in the light and warmth of the sun. They take rest after their exertion. Now naiads appear, who bring water to refresh the growth, and the Spirit of Corn dances in thanksgiving. Satyrs and fauns enter playing their pipes, and attempt to carry off the Spirit of the Corn, but she is rescued by the wind of Zephyr.
Tableau 4 — A landscape in Autumn
The Seasons take part in a glorious dance (the well-known ""autumn bacchanale"") while leaves from autumn trees rain upon their merriment.
Apotheosis — The Sable sky
Constellations of stars sparkle above the earth.

The Seasons is a ballet with music by John Cage and choreography by Merce Cunningham, first performed in 1947. It was Cage's first piece for orchestra[1] and also the first to use what Cage later called the gamut technique, albeit in an early form.[2][3]


Overview[edit]
Cage composed the music in early 1947, in the midst of working on Sonatas and Interludes. A piano version was first completed, and an orchestral arrangement followed. Cage dedicated The Seasons to Lincoln Kirstein. The ballet was premiered on May 17, 1947 by the Ballet Society (by which the work was commissioned[4]) at the Ziegfeld Theatre  in New York City, with original choreography by Merce Cunningham (now lost[4]). Costumes and scenery were designed by Isamu Noguchi. The dancers at the first performance were Gisela Caccialanza, Fred Danieli, Dorothy Dushock, Gerard Leavitt, Tanaquil LeClercq, Job Sanders, Beatrice Tompkins and Cunningham himself.[5]
The ballet is in one act divided into nine sections: Prelude I, Winter; Prelude II, Spring; Prelude III, Summer; Prelude IV, Fall; Finale (Prelude I). As in Sonatas and Interludes and the later String Quartet in Four Parts (1950), Cage was influenced by Indian aesthetics and like the latter work, The Seasons is built on the Indian concept of seasons: winter is associated with quiescence, spring with creation, summer with preservation and fall with destruction. The Finale is a reprise of the first Prelude, symbolizing the cyclical nature of seasons.[1]
As in the majority of Cage's compositions from the 1940s, the music of The Seasons is based on a predefined proportion. In this case the proportion is 2, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, and it governs not only the construction of individual movements, but also the proportions of the entire work, roughly defining the relative lengths of the movements.[1] The compositional technique involves using gamuts of sounds, i.e. predefined sonorities (single notes, chords, aggregates); Cage started developing this approach in The Seasons, and later perfected it in String Quartet in Four Parts and Concerto for Prepared Piano.[3]

The Seasons' Canon is a contemporary ballet choreographed by Crystal Pite to Max Richter's recomposition of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons. The ballet is Pite's first work made for the Paris Opera Ballet, and premiered in 24 September 2016 at the Palais Garnier. Pite won the Prix Benois de la Danse for Best Choreographer.


Production[edit]
Canadian choreographer Crystal Pite was invited by artistic director Benjamin Millepied to create the ballet for the company's opening gala for the season, though he resigned months before the premiere and was succeeded by Aurélie Dupont.[1] At the time, Pite was already an established choreographer, though she was largely unknown in France.[1]
The Seasons' Canon is set to Max Richter's recomposition of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons.[2] The choreography is inspired by the movements of tectonic plates.[3] The ballet is performed by 54 dancers.[4] The original cast includes étoiles Marie-Agnès Gillot, Ludmila Pagliero and Alice Renavand, as well as several premier danseurs.[4] Despite casting some dancers from the higher ranks, she noted, ""They have featured roles, but it was important to me that they were women into  [sic] the community as well.""[4]
Pite was only given four weeks to work on the choreography, which she described as ""a sprint.""[4]  Pite regards herself as a contemporary dance choreographer, and found it difficult to fit into ballet when she was a dancer. However, she enjoyed working with classical ballet dancers because ""the kind of architecture they have in their bodies is so ecstatic and beautiful.""[4] She added, ""The dancers at [Paris Opera Ballet] are amazing, but they have a very different skill set and vocabulary. It stretches me to find a way to deliver their excellence while still staying true to the values that I hold as a choreographer."" She described the dancers as ""open, willing, generous, patient and delightfully hungry.""[4]
The costumes were designed by Nancy Bryant, with khaki green trousers, the men bare-chested and the women in sheer tops. The dancers' throats are painted blue-green.[1] The set and lighting were designed by Jay Gower Taylor and Tom Visser respectively.[1]

Performances[edit]
The Seasons' Canon premiered in 24 September 2016 at the Palais Garnier.[1] The Pacific Northwest Ballet debuted the ballet in November 2022.[5]

Critical reception[edit]
Laura Capelle of The Financial Times gave The Seasons' Canon five stars. She commented, ""The sculptural tableaux and mass effects are far from today's pas de deux-centric work and practically a throwback to Maurice Béjart. Their musicality and grounded articulation demonstrate Pite's craft; Jiří Kylián was an early influence, and this is still felt in a series of short duets. The [Paris Opera Ballet] responded to the work with wholehearted commitment, and one hopes Pite will be back to build on this first collaboration.""[2] Roslyn Sulcas of New York Times, wrote that ""Pite has created massed blocks of movement that focus on large-scale patterning to often thrilling effect,"" but ""the piece feels all about effect.""[1]
For her work on The Seasons' Canon, Pite won the Prix Benois de la Danse for Best Choreographer.[6]

Serenade is a ballet by George Balanchine to Tchaikovsky's  1880 Serenade for Strings in C, Op. 48. Serenade is credited as being George Balanchine's first full-length ballet in America. Using the students of his newly formed School of American Ballet, Balanchine choreographed this ballet for an American audience that had not been widely exposed to ballet before.[1] Students of the School of American Ballet gave the first performance on Sunday, 10 June 1934 on the Felix M. Warburg estate in White Plains, N.Y., where Mozartiana had been danced the previous day.
It was then presented by the Producing Company of the School of American Ballet on 6 December at the Avery Memorial Theatre of the Wadsworth Atheneum with sets by the painter William Littlefield. Balanchine presented the ballet as his response to the generous sponsorships he received during his immigration to America.[2]  The official premiere took place on 1 March 1935[3] with the American Ballet at the Adelphi Theatre, New York, conducted by Sandor Harmati.
NYCB principal dancer Philip Neal chose to include Serenade in his farewell performance on Sunday, 13 June 2010.
The blue tutus used in Serenade inspired the naming of the Balanchine crater on the planet Mercury.[4]

Kansas City Ballet dancers in Serenade
The work can be considered a bridge between his two early works for Sergei Diaghilev and his later, less episodic American works.[5] The dance is characterized by two falls, a choreographic allusion to Giselle, but also an element in the Khorumi, a Georgian folk dance which influenced Balanchine.[5]
While Serenade is one of Balanchine's infamous plotless ballets, many elements of the dance seem to point towards a loose form of a story. As dancers came and went during the rehearsal process, Balanchine choreographed their entrances and exits into the piece. At the beginning of rehearsals, Balanchine started with seventeen young women, reflected in the opening scene of the ballet. The next rehearsal there were only nine women present and then six, so he choreographed the following scenes with those numbers of dancers. Male students began to attend the rehearsals and so they were choreographed in, and the late arrival of one woman was also included.[6] While plotless, Serenade reflected the ups and downs of choreographing a ballet, and made the humanity of the dancers clear when he choreographed their real-life mistakes into the finished product.
By achieving this, Balanchine made the ballet very student-friendly: according to City Ballet's Robert Gottlieb, the ballet was formed in such a way “in order to have something to teach the students with—something they could handle yet would stretch their abilities,”.[6] The rehearsal process was extensive - according to some sources the students underwent as long as six months of rehearsal before their first performance in 1934 [6] - and included levels of increasingly difficult technique as the ballet went on. Starting with a simple gesture phrase, the ballet then explores everything from complex formations to technical elements of partnering in the “Waltzing Girl”, for example. Thus, the ballet acted as an important teaching tool that students of all advanced levels could potentially participate in and work up to as a graduation exercise.
Choreographed to a sweeping Tchaikovsky score and with nods to traditional ballets such as Giselle and Swan Lake, Balanchine also created an atmosphere of yearning and romanticism, aided by the soft blue tutus of the women and dimmed lighting.[7]
While the piece was first choreographed with students in mind, the American Ballet Theatre is the first ballet company credited with performing it. Starting in 1935 the company performed Serenade, first for two weeks in New York City and then moving on with a fourteen-week tour of the United States. While their early performances were not highly successful, many interpreted this “lack of enthusiasm as an indication of the company’s immaturity,” [1] and ballet's general premature introduction to the United States.

Seven Beauties is an Azerbaijani ballet composed by Gara Garayev in 1947–48 to mark the 800th anniversary of classical Persians/Azerbaijanis. His creative activity has strong bound with the Persian  poet Nizami Ganjavi. Set in the 12th century, the libretto by I. Hidayetzade, Yuri Slonimsky and Sabit Rahman is based on motifs from Ganjavi’s Seven beauties poem, written in 1197.

A storm catches Bahram Shah during a hunt. While looking for a shelter in ruins of an old castle, he met a hermit, who shows him images of seven beauties from different countries. It seems to Bahram that the beauties are revived and are going round with amazing dances. At daybreak the beauties disappear. Bahram leaves the palace and goes home. On the road he sees a stately youngster Manzar and his sister Aysha competing in a bow. Bahram calls Manzar to compete. Then they exchange gifts according to custom. Bahram gives Manzar a belt, and he gives him a sword. After Manzar goes away, Bahram makes Aysha a declaration of love. Aysha also confesses to the hunter. And when servants and a vizier come for lost Bahram, Aysha and Manzar know that this young hunter is none other than the Shah. Vizier informs him about the Khazars’ invasion.
Bahram gives authority to the vizier and takes the field. But the vizier, who has a plan about seizure of power, charges two of his closes to disguise themselves in Khazars’ costume, to catch up and kill the Shah. A gloomy demonstration is observed on the square and population begs for mercy. Captivated girls follow the defaulters. Fierce servants of the Shah pounce on goods on stores, plunder and demolish everything which fall into their hands, after which the population terribly runs away. At that time the vizier enjoys the power, goes down to underground treasury, where he wears splendid clothes. He dreams of that day, when he’ll be a Shah. At that time a killer comes and says that they couldn’t attempt on the Shah’s life. Then voices of horn are heard. Returning to the capital Bahram, who knows about the conspiracy, wants a reprisal. But he can’t leave the palace because of the vizier’s guards. Then Manzar calls armed craftsmen for help. At that time, a solemn demonstration led by the vizier goes out from the palace. He gives Bahram symbols of power. Manzar knows about the vizier’s perfidy, but the vizier kills close before the Shah’s eyes, to show his loyalty to the Shah and that allegedly he was the organizer of the conspiracy. Guards disarm the population, tie up craftsmen and Manzar and imprison them.
Knowing about Manzar’s and craftsmen’s imprisonment, Aysha runs to the palace and begs the Shah, who feasts at that time, to set them free. The Shah releases only Manzar in memory of their former friendship. Disturbed by Bahram’s act that didn’t punish the vizier and release the craftsmen, Manzar drop the belt, presented by the Shah, on the ground. This act outrages the Shah and he ordered to execute Manzar. But he runs away. The vizier wants to distract the Shah. He shows him silk textile, on which seven beauties are portrayed. Shah remembers that night spent in ruins of the palace and seven beauties seem to him again. The Shah forgets about vital problems, what the vizier tries to obtain to seize the power. He goes to a village with his guards where Manzar takes cover. Knowing that peasants don’t want to give up Manzar, the vizier orders to trample down the peasants’ crops. The peasants appeal to the Shah. But the Shah’s thinks only about Aysha, whom he cannot forget. But Aysha refuses Bahram’s love, who dooms the population to starvation. Bahram orders the vizier to burn the village. Suddenly seven young peasants and craftsmen appear while the vizier looks at the fire. They commit revenge and the vizier dies.
Bahram wants to forget Aysha. That is why he returns to the palace, seeking oblivion in seven beauties. But at that time a thunderclap is heard and walls of the palace are parted. Seven messengers of the population appear and give the Shah a crook and cloak showing him that he has to abdicate and leave the country. Suddenly Aysha appears, saying the Shah that she loves not him, but a hunter and is ready to go with him if he abdicates. Wrathful Bahram strikes the girl with a fatal blow of the sword. The population bids farewell to Aysha and drive Bahram away.

362,The Shagreen Bone,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shagreen_Bone,"The Shagreen Bone , Yuri Khanon , 1992","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Passepied from the opera-entr'acte The Shagreen Bone
The Shagreen Bone (French: L'Os de chagrin, Russian: Шагреневая кость) Op. 37-38 (1990) is a full-length ballet in three acts and an opera entr'acte in one act by Yuri Khanon, to a libretto by the composer based on Balzac's 1831 novel The Shagreen Skin.

Background[edit]
The ballet (Op.37) and the entr'acte (Op.38) were written in 1990 on commission from the Mikhaylovsky Theatre in Leningrad. The libretto is based entirely on the dialogues between the two characters – Pauline and Raphael.
In 1992, an avant-garde film-opera The Shagreen Bone was shot at the Saint Petersburg Documentary Film Studio, with Yuri Khanon in the main role. The soundtrack contained the entr'acte and some of his other works: The Song about Death No.1 and Mechanics of Thought Movement (from the cycle Public Songs, Op. 34). The film choreographer and scenographer was Andrey Bosov, the leader of the youth group of the Kirov Ballet.
The Shagreen Bone is written in the genre of ""tendentious classical ballet"" or ""ballet with comments."" Paradoxically, it was Ludwig Minkus's Don Quixote and Eric Satie's Parade which served as reference for the composer.[1]

The point of reference for me became the ballet Parade by Satie. On the first page of the full score the imperishable words shine: ""To Erik Satie, my father, comrade, communist."" The opera entr'acte performed between the second and third act was inspired by Satie's idea of furniture music. As the baritone informs, the spectators can ""go for a walk and have some meat"" while on the stage there is a veristic performance depicting the relationship between the lovers. Every time the action overheats, a quiet and imperturbable rococo dance follows: Menuet, Passepied, Bourrée. This continues until the death of the hero and of the author. According to the novel of Balzac, they die from coughing, which looks very realistic on the stage.[2]
— Yuri Khanon: ""Primary position""
When working on the ballet libretto Khanon noticed how ""hastily and carelessly this novel was written."" Throughout the text one feels how Balzac was in a hurry to finish on time. Under the pressure of his creditors, he worked himself to the point of exhaustion.[3]

Despite of eclectic and spreading, novel ""Shagreen Skin"" is a very constructive composition: the whole structure is described by one line of successive decreasing of life. <...> It pleases how carelessly the story is written, everywhere feels how Balzac hurried up..., under the pressure of his creditors the writer made his violent activity so intensive that caught a nervous exhaustion. The heavy weight of nervous exhausting, heavy activity, and also pressure of the creditors are still in his works and creates vain stress. In general, I decided that the ballet under Shagreen Skin should be a holiday of joyful decreasing of life.[4] As soon as the curtain rises a huge ossified line of Destiny (line of Sterne) appears.[5]
— Yuri Khanon: ""Primary position""
Menuet from the opera-entr'acte The Shagreen Bone
As composer and librettist in one, Khanon created a complete spectacle, a compressed version, a sort of extract of the formal ballet language. His aim was to stage not only a ballet but a ""ballet about ballet."" The Shagreen Bone was defined by the author as a rearguard ballet. This is a reference to the past, while keeping the odor of the present.[6]
A question that often arises is how has it happened that the ""Wild Ass's Skin"" turned into a ""Bone""? One can answer like this, for example: how many years have passed ""since then""? Anything that does not decompose ossifies and then petrifies. In the novel Vanière, the gardener of monsieur Raphael de Valanten, examines with surprise a shagreen he found in a well and says: ""dry as wood and not greasy at all."" Thus, the work illustrates the idea of ossification of any culture, including classical ballet.[7]
The Shagreen Bone is somehow the ""reset"" (rejection) of the culture of ballet. Subjected to the laws of ballet and summarizing the results of its development, the work demonstrates the absurdity of ballet and its stagnant forms. The composer seems to rise from the orchestra pit and throw bones in the face of the audience, that is to say, ballet clichés: grand pas, fouettés, variations, adagios. Yet the result is a beautiful romantic ballet, showed twice: firstly the ballet as such, with its meaningless joy and conventional character, and secondly with the author's attitude. This was one of the reasons, among others, for changing the title and replacing the ""skin"" with a ""bone.""[8]

Slaughter on Tenth Avenue is a ballet with music by Richard Rodgers and choreography by George Balanchine. It occurs near the end of Rodgers and Hart's 1936 Broadway musical comedy On Your Toes. Slaughter is the story of a hoofer who falls in love with a dance hall girl but is then shot and killed by her jealous boyfriend. The hoofer then shoots the boyfriend.
The ballet is integrated into the plot of the musical by the device of having two gangsters watching it from box seats in the theatre in which it is staged. They have orders to shoot the leading dancer (played by Ray Bolger in the original production). The dancer, who has been warned just in time, evades them by suddenly dancing at full speed even after the ballet actually ends, and finally two police officers enter and arrest the gangsters.
Slaughter on Tenth Avenue was danced by Ray Bolger and Tamara Geva in the original stage production of On Your Toes, and by Eddie Albert and Vera Zorina in the film version. In Words and Music, the 1948 Technicolor film biography of Rodgers and Hart, the ballet was danced by Gene Kelly and Vera-Ellen, with a somewhat revised, more tragic storyline, and new choreography by Kelly (in Kelly's version, the boyfriend, in addition to killing the dance hall girl, also kills the hoofer).
The first television performance of ""Slaughter"" was on NBC-TV's Garroway at Large program in 1950 or 1951, with the NBC Chicago studio orchestra under the direction of Joseph Gallichio.[1]
Slaughter on Tenth Avenue entered the repertoire of the New York City Ballet in 1968, first danced by Suzanne Farrell and Arthur Mitchell.[2]

Ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
Ballets by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky
Swan Lake (1876)
The Sleeping Beauty (1889)
The Nutcracker (1892)

List of all compositionsvte
The Sleeping Beauty (Russian: Спящая красавица, tr. Spyashchaya krasavitsa listenⓘ) is a ballet in a prologue and three acts to music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, his Opus 66, completed in 1889. It is the second of his three ballets and, at 160 minutes, his second-longest work in any genre. The original scenario was by Ivan Vsevolozhsky after Perrault's La belle au bois dormant, or The Beauty Sleeping in the  Forest; the first choreographer was Marius Petipa. The premiere took place at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg on January 15, 1890, and from that year forward The Sleeping Beauty has remained one of the most famous of all ballets.[1]


History[edit]
Tchaikovsky was approached by the Director of the Imperial Theatres in St. Petersburg, Ivan Vsevolozhsky on 25 May 1888 about a possible ballet adaptation on the subject of the story of Undine. It was later decided that Charles Perrault's La Belle au bois dormant would be the story for which Tchaikovsky would compose the music for the ballet. Tchaikovsky did not hesitate to accept the commission, although he was aware that his only previous ballet, Swan Lake, met with little enthusiasm at that stage of his career.
Tchaikovsky based his work on Brothers Grimm's version of Perrault's 'Dornröschen'. In that version, the Princess's parents survive the 100-year sleep to celebrate the Princess's wedding with the Prince. However, Vsevolozhsky incorporated Perrault's other characters from his stories into the ballet, such as Puss in Boots, Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, Bluebird, Bluebeard, Ricky of the Tuft and Tom Thumb. Other French fairy tale characters to be featured are Beauty and the Beast, Pretty Goldilocks and The White Cat. Regardless, Tchaikovsky was happy to inform the Director of the Imperial Theatre that he had great pleasure studying the work and came away with adequate inspiration to do it justice.[citation needed]
The choreographer was Marius Petipa, ballet master of the Imperial Ballet, who wrote a very detailed list of instructions as to the musical requirements. Tchaikovsky worked quickly on the new work at Frolovskoye; he began initial sketches in the winter of 1888 and began orchestration on the work on 30 May 1889.
The ballet's focus was on the two main conflicting forces of good (the Lilac Fairy) and evil (Carabosse); each has a leitmotif representing them, which run through the entire ballet, serving as an important thread to the underlying plot. Act III of the work, however, takes a complete break from the two motifs and instead places focus on the individual characters of the various court dances.

The ballet's premiere received more favorable accolades than Swan Lake from the press but Tchaikovsky never had the luxury of being able to witness his work become an instant success in theatres outside of Russia. He died in 1893. By 1903, The Sleeping Beauty was the second most popular ballet in the repertory of the Imperial Ballet (the Petipa/Pugni The Pharaoh's Daughter was first), having been performed 200 times in only 10 years.Original cast members costumed for Act I. At center is Carlotta Brianza as Aurora. Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, 1890
A production mounted at the La Scala in Milan did not arouse much interest and it was not until 1921 that, in London, the ballet finally gained wide acclaim and eventually a permanent place in the classical repertoire. In 1999, the Mariinsky Ballet reconstructed the original 1890 production, including reproductions of the original sets and costumes. Although the 1951 Kirov production by Konstantin Sergeyev is available on DVD/Video, the 1999 ""authentic"" version was never commercially released.
The Sleeping Beauty is Tchaikovsky's longest ballet, lasting nearly four hours at full length (counting the intermissions). The complete score runs practically 3 hours. It is nearly always cut.[according to whom?]
At the premiere, Tsar Alexander III summoned Tchaikovsky to the imperial box. The Tsar made the simple remark 'Very nice,' which seemed to have irritated Tchaikovsky, who had likely expected a more favorable response.[2] In any case the Tsar immediately paid Tchaikovsky a substantial bonus.[3]

Synopsis[edit]
Setting

Time: Baroque
Place: Europe
The bad fairy Carabosse by Léon Bakst, who created the décor and about 300 costume designs in 2 months for Diaghilev's lavish 1921 production of The Sleeping Beauty in London.
Prologue — Le baptême de la Princesse AuroreKing Florestan XXIV and his Queen have welcomed their first child, Princess Aurora, and declare a grand christening ceremony to honor her. Six fairies are invited to the ceremony to bestow gifts on the child. Each fairy brings a gift of a virtue or positive trait, such as beauty, courage, sweetness, musical talent, and mischief. The most powerful fairy, the Lilac Fairy,[13] arrives with her entourage, but before she can bestow her gift, the evil fairy Carabosse arrives with her minions.[14] Carabosse furiously asks the King and Queen why she had not received an invitation to the christening. The blame falls on Catalabutte, the Master of Ceremonies who was in charge of the guest list. Carabosse gleefully tears his wig off and beats him with her staff, before placing a curse upon the baby princess as revenge: Aurora will indeed grow up to be a beautiful, healthy, delightful young lady, but on her sixteenth birthday she will prick her finger on a spindle and die. The King and Queen are horrified and beg Carabosse for mercy, but she shows none. However, the Lilac Fairy intervenes. Though she does not have enough power to completely undo the curse, she alters it, allowing the spindle to cause a peaceful 100-year sleep for the princess, rather than death. At the end of those 100 years, she will be woken by the kiss of a handsome prince. Relieved that Aurora's life will ultimately be spared, the court is set at ease.
Act I — Les quatre fiancés de la Princesse AuroreIt is the day of Princess Aurora's sixteenth birthday. Celebrations are underway, though the King is still unsettled by Carabosse's omen. The master of ceremonies discovers several peasant ladies frolicking about with knitting needles and alerts the King, who initially sentences the women to a harsh punishment. The Queen gently persuades him to spare the innocent citizens, and he agrees. An elaborate waltz is performed and Princess Aurora arrives.[15][16] She is introduced to four suitors by her doting parents. Aurora and the suitors perform the famous Rose Adagio.[17] Presently, a cloaked stranger appears and offers a gift to the princess: a spindle. Having never seen one before, Aurora curiously examines the strange object as her parents desperately try to intervene. As predicted, she pricks her finger.[18] While initially appearing to recover quickly, she falls into a swoon and collapses. The cloaked stranger reveals herself to be Carabosse, who believes that her curse still stands and that the princess is dead. Once again, the Lilac Fairy quells the hubbub and reminds the King and Queen that Aurora is merely asleep. The princess is carried off to bed, and the Lilac Fairy casts a spell of slumber over the entire kingdom, which will only be broken when Aurora awakens. A thick layer of thorny plants grows over the palace, hiding it from view.

Carlotta Brianza as Princess Aurora and Pavel Gerdt as Prince Désiré, costumed for the Grand Procession of Act III in Petipa's original production of The Sleeping Beauty.(Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, 1890)
Act II, Scene I — La chasse du Prince DésiréOne hundred years later, Prince Désiré is attending a hunting party. Though his companions are lighthearted, the prince is unhappy and eventually asks to be left alone. On his own in the forest, he is met by the Lilac Fairy, who has chosen him to awaken Aurora. She shows him a vision of the beautiful princess, and the prince is immediately smitten.[19] The Lilac Fairy explains the situation, and Désiré begs to be taken to the princess. The Lilac Fairy takes him to the hidden castle. Carabosse makes one last attempt to cement her vengeful curse, but the Lilac Fairy and the prince manage to defeat her together at last. 
Act II, Scene II — Le château de la belle au bois dormantOnce inside the castle, Désiré awakens Aurora with a kiss. The rest of the court wakes as well, and the King and Queen heartily approve when the prince proposes marriage and the princess accepts.
Act III — Les noces de Désiré et d'AuroreThe royal wedding is under way. Guests include the Jewel Fairies: Diamond, Gold, Silver and Sapphire, and of course the Lilac Fairy.[20] Fairytale characters are in attendance, including Puss in Boots and The White Cat,[21] Princess Florine and the Bluebird,[22] and others. Aurora and Désiré perform a grand Pas de Deux,[23][24] and the entire ensemble dances. The prince and princess are married, with the Lilac Fairy blessing the union.

Trademark controversy[edit]
In 2007, The Walt Disney Company registered a trademark with the US Patent and Trademark Office for the name ""Princess Aurora"" that was to cover production and distribution of motion picture films; production of television programs; production of sound and video recordings.[25] This could have limited the ability to perform this ballet, from which Disney acquired some of the music for its animated 1959 film Sleeping Beauty.[26] However, this trademark has since been removed from the registry.[25]

Ballet choreographed by George Balanchine


SonatineChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicMaurice RavelPremiereMay 15, 1975 (1975-05-15)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletCreated forViolette VerdyJean-Pierre Bonnefoux
Sonatine is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Ravel's eponymous music. The ballet was made for the New York City Ballet's Ravel Festival, which celebrated the centenary of Ravel, and premiered on  May 15, 1975, at the New York State Theater, following a preview performance the previous day. The ballet was originated by Violette Verdy and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux.


Choreography[edit]
In his book Balanchine's Complete Stories of the Great Ballets, Balanchine described the ballet, ""The pianist and the dancers are on stage together when the curtain goes up on the ballet. The pianist begins to play; the girl and the boy stand up and listen. They like what they hear, apparently, for they begin to move to it, following its line, and gradually becoming imbued with its spirit.""[1]

Production[edit]
Balanchine decided that for French composer Maurice Ravel's centenary in 1975, the New York City Ballet would hold the Ravel Festival to honor him.[1] In the previous forty years, Balanchine had only made two ballets to Ravel's works.[2] However, he stated he always enjoyed his music and decided ""it would be a good idea to celebrate this wonderful composer’s life and work by arranging new dances to as many scores as we could.""[1] The festival featured sixteen premieres. While some were large productions, others, including Sonatine, were much smaller productions, which were ""a few minutes long, simply using Ravel’s music and making what we could of it.""[1] Two French-born principal dancers, Violette Verdy and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux, were chosen to originate the two roles in the ballet. Verdy in particular had not created roles for Balanchine for several years prior to Sonatine.[2]

Performances[edit]
Sonatine had a preview performance on May 14, 1975, at the New York State Theater, during a gala benefit attended by French and American dignitaries. The following day, the ballet had its official premiere, as the first ballet performed at the Ravel Festival.[2][3][4] Madeleine Malraux played the piano at the premiere.[3]
In 2004, the New York City Ballet included Sonatine in its Balanchine centenary celebration, with the ballet danced by guest artists from the Paris Opera Ballet, Aurélie Dupont and Manuel Legris.[5] In 2015, Sonatine was filmed during the New York City Ballet's appearances at Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris. It was aired on PBS Great Performances broadcast ""New York City Ballet in Paris"" in 2017.[6]
Other ballet companies that have performed Sonatine include the Paris Opera Ballet, which performed the ballet during a tribute program to Verdy in 2016,[7] as well as the Miami City Ballet and Suzanne Farrell Ballet.[8]

Critical reception[edit]
Following the premiere of Sonatine, New York Times critic Clive Barnes commented, ""The form of the duet – with its casual dancers around a piano – recalls Duo Concertante  [sic] in its calculated informality, and Mr. Balanchine's dances hug the music comfortably. The mood is light and rhapsodic, but there are a few happy moments of unaffected originality.""[3]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


(Left to right) Carlos Acosta, Darcey Bussell and Gary Avis at the curtain call of MacMillan's Song of the Earth
The Song of the Earth is a ballet based on Das Lied von der Erde, a symphonic work written by the Austrian composer Gustav Mahler in 1908–1909. It is scored for two voices and orchestra, and has been used for ballets by several well-known choreographers, including Antony Tudor (1908–1987), Kenneth MacMillan (1929–1992), Heinz Spoerli (born 1940), and John Neumeier (born 1939).[1]


Tudor version[edit]
Song of the EarthChoreographerAntony TudorPremiere14 April 1948 (1948-04-14)Metropolitan Opera HouseOriginal ballet companyAmerican Ballet TheatreDesignJo Mielziner
As staff choreographer with Ballet theatre (later American Ballet Theatre), Antony Tudor began creating a ballet set to Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde. The six songs based on ancient Chinese poems, expressing the transience of human existence, had long interested him as a choreographic possibility. He explained their appeal: ""Like the seasons, human experience is cyclical and has no sudden beginning or end.""[2] His ballet, entitled Shadow of the Wind, had its premiere on 14 April 1948 at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. Scenery, costumes, and lighting were designed by Jo Mielziner.[3] The dancers were Igor Youskevitch, Hugh Laing, and Dimitri Romanoff (in ""Six Idlers of the Bamboo Valley,"" set to song I); Alicia Alonso, John Kriza, and Mary Burr (in ""The Abandoned Wife,"" set to song II); Ruth Ann Koesun and Crandall Diehl (in ""My Lord Summons Me,"" set to song III); Diana Adams and Zachary Solov (in ""The Lotus Gatherers,"" set to song IV); Hugh Laing (in ""Conversation with Winepot and Bird,"" set to song V); and Nana Goldner, Hugh Laing, and Dimitri Romanoff (in ""Poem for the Guitar,"" set to song VI).[4][5] Photographs of the cast by Carl Van Vechten show elaborate costumes of flowing draperies in pseudo-Chinese style and the dancers in supposedly Oriental attitudes.[6]
The ballet was not a success, receiving scarcely a positive word in the press. John Martin, writing in the New York Times, damned it with faint praise. ""To this combination of ancient Chinese classic hedonism already screened through a process of Germanic Weltschmerz, Tudor has deliberately added the academic formation of the traditional ballet.[7] The work had only three performances, the last of which played to a house that had dropped to 24 percent capacity.[8]

MacMillan version[edit]
Song of the EarthNative titleDas Lied von der ErdeChoreographerKenneth MacMillanPremiere7 November 1965 (1965-11-07)Staatstheater StuttgartOriginal ballet companyStuttgart BalletDesignNicholas Georgiadis
In 1959, Kenneth MacMillan asked the directors of the Royal Opera House in London if he might use Mahler's Das Lied von der Erde in a new commission for the Royal Ballet. He was refused because it was thought that such a major musical work was not suitable accompaniment for ballet. In 1965, however, MacMillan offered the idea to his friend John Cranko, director of the Stuttgart Ballet, who promptly accepted it.[9] MacMillan summarized the scenario of his work in these words: ""A man and a woman; death takes the man; they both return to her, and at the end of the ballet we find that in death there is the promise of renewal."" With Marcia Haydée as Die Frau, Ray Barra as Der Mann, and Egon Madsen as Der Ewig (The Eternal One), it had its first performance on 7 November 1965 at the Württembergische Staatstheater in Stuttgart. Margarethe Bence, mezzo-soprano, and James Harper, tenor, sang the six ""songs of the Earth."" In MacMillan's choreography, the young woman is a figure of loneliness, isolated from the movements of her friends, and the man, like others in his group, is blissfully unaware of his mortality. The Eternal One is not a figure of evil but a gentle, ever-present companion to all in the ensemble.
The ballet was an instant success, widely admired by German audiences and critics alike. The Royal Ballet took the piece into its repertory only six months after its Stuttgart premiere. Presented under its English title, Song of the Earth, in May 1966 at the Royal Opera House in London, it starred guest artist Marcia Haydée as The Woman, Donald MacLeary as The Man, and Anthony Dowell as The Messenger of Death. Nicholas Georgiadis adapted his original costume designs for the Covent Garden production. The choreography is described as ""earthbound, non-classical movements that morph seamlessly into modernist curves in a work of breathtaking beauty and power.""[10]
In 2007, the ballet was broadcast live on BBC Two, as Darcey Bussell's farewell performance, with The Man and The Messenger of Death danced by Gary Avis and Carlos Acosta respectively.[11][12] In 2017, on the 25th anniversary of MacMillan's death, five ballet companies across the UK presented a mixed bill titled Kenneth MacMillan: a National Celebration at the Royal Opera House. Song of the Earth was performed by English National Ballet, with Erina Takahashi as The Woman, Isaac Hernández as The Man and Jeffrey Cirio (a guest principal) as The Messenger of Death.[13] In 2020, the English National Ballet released video of Song of the Earth online in response to the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts. This performance was filmed in 2017 at Palace Theatre, Manchester, intended for internal archival, with Tamara Rojo as the Woman, Joseph Caley as The Man and Cirio as The Messenger of Death.[14]

Spoerli version[edit]
Song of the EarthNative titleDas Lied von der ErdeChoreographerHeinz SpoerliPremiere Zurich Opera HouseOriginal ballet companyZurich BalletDesignFlorian EttiClaudia Binder
Swiss choreographer Heinz Spoerli created his version of Das Lied von der Erde in 2011, as he was nearing retirement at the end of his long tenure as director of the Zurich Ballet. It was a fitting choice for him, as the last of the six songs ends with the words ewig, ewig, ewig (""always, always, always""), sounding, as one critic wrote, ""like the never-ending echo of farewells in the night.""[15] It is a melancholy reminiscence of life's journey from the morning of youthful exuberance to the sunset of declining days and the gathering twilight. In his choreography, Spoerli associates the six musical episodes with the protagonists conjured up by Mahler's music and the Chinese poems, entitled in their English translations as ""The Drinking Song of Earth's Sorrow,"" ""The Solitary One in Autumn,"" ""Youth,"" ""Beauty,"" ""The Drunkard in Spring,"" and ""The Farewell.""[16]
With scenery designed by Florian Etti and costumes by Claudia Binder, Spoerli's ballet had its first performance on 2 April 2011 at the Opernhaus Zürich.[17] The original cast of six soloists included Vahe Martirosyan (The Man), Karine Seneca (Eternity), Filipe Portugal (Death), Arman Grigoryan (The Divided), Galina Mihaylova (The Girl), and Sarah-Jane Brodbeck (The Beauty).[18] Spoerli did not attempt to illustrate the text of the poems, as MacMillan had done in his 1965 version. Instead, he took his choreographic clues from words, phrases, and moods of the text and created meditative dances for each song. ""The result is a hauntingly beautiful succession of scenes, big and small ensembles, but hardly any solos, based on the contemporary classic vocabulary.""[19]

Neumeier version[edit]
Song of the EarthNative titleLe Chant de la TerreChoreographerJohn NeumeierPremiere24 February 2015 (2015-02-24)Palais GarnierOriginal ballet companyParis Opera BalletDesignJohn Neumeier
In 2015, at the age of 72, choreographer John Neumeier continued his career-long fascination with making dances to the music of Gustav Mahler. His ballet set to Das Lied von der Erde was made for the Paris Opera Ballet. With sets, costumes, and lighting designed by the choreographer himself, it had its first performance on 24 February 2015 at the Palais Garnier, the company's home theater. The conductor was Patrick Lange, and the singers were Burkhard Fritz, tenor, and Paul Armin Edelmann, baritone. Under the French title Le Chant de la Terre, it was danced by ""les étoiles, les premiers danseurs, et corps de ballet"" of the company.[20] As in MacMillan's version, a woman and two men lead the cast, but the action follows the two men rather than the woman. Mathieu Ganio was a strong, melancholy presence as Le Homme; Karl Paquette was his shadowy double; and Laetitia Pujol portrayed La Femme. The work did not meet with unqualified success. The choreography was criticized for being overliteral in its interpretation of songs inspired by the ancient Chinese poems, and the dancers were faulted for technical inadequacies. Only Ganio and Pujol won praise for their moving performance of ""Der Abschied,"" the final song.[21]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

(Redirected from La Source (Saint-Léon))
This article is about the Delibes/Minkus 1866 ballet. For Balanchine's 1968 ballet, see La source (Balanchine). For other uses, see La Source (disambiguation).


Eugénie Fiocre in La Source, painting by Edgar Degas, circa 1868
La source (The Spring) is a ballet in three acts/four scenes with a score composed by Léo Delibes and Ludwig Minkus (Minkus: Act I & Act III-Scene 2/Delibes: Act II & Act III-Scene 1) which was premiered in Paris in 1866 with choreography by Arthur Saint-Léon. In 1878 in Vienna it was called Naïla, die Quellenfee (Naïla, the Waternymph).


History[edit]
Louis Mérante as Djémil in La Source, Paris, 1866
The choreography was by Arthur Saint-Léon, who collaborated with Charles Nuitter in the libretto. The original designs were by Édouard Desplechin, Jean-Baptiste Lavastre, Auguste Rubé, Chaperon (sets) and Paul Lormier (costumes). The first production opened at the Théâtre Impérial de l´Opéra in Paris on 12 November 1866, with Guglielmina Salvioni (Naïla), Eugenie Fiocre (Nouredda) and Louis Mérante (Djémil) in the principal roles.  The production was not particularly successful, Salvioni being considered unsuited to the rôle of Naïla. It triumphed in the following year, however, with Adèle Grantzow as Naïla, and remained a mainstay of the repertory for the next few years.  A successful revival in 1872 showcased Rita Sangalli in the principal rôle, and it was for this production that the new variations for Naïla were introduced, the music most likely by Delibes himself (Nos. 12b and 23a in the list of musical numbers in the piano score, see below).
Delibes was second chorus master at the Paris Opera and had until then written operettas, songs and sacred music. A comparison of the music of the two composers greatly favoured Delibes,[1] whose contributions were considered ""fresh and more rhythmic"", with one critic suggesting that the whole ballet score should have been assigned to Delibes. La source was his first big success, marking him as an important composer for the ballet.[2]
La source was produced in St Petersburg in 1902 with Olga Preobrajenska as Naïla, choreographed by Achille Coppini. In 1907 Nijinsky made his solo debut in the last act of La source at the Mariinsky.[3]
The ballet was revived in 1925 by Agrippina Vaganova to the Theatre of Opera and Ballet in Leningrad to her pupil Marina Semyonova – Marina Semyonova started to work on the scene from this ballet.[4]
A video of the La source pas de deux taken from the 2008 graduation performance of the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, may be found on YouTube, the choreography credited to Konstantin Sergeyev after Coppini and possibly created for Preobrajenskaya; the music is by Riccardo Drigo, composer of most of the additional dances added to the company's repertory in the early 20th century.[5]

Synopsis[edit]
Una gola in mezzo ad alte montagne, set design for La Sorgente (1889).
Act 1. On her way to marry the Khan of Ghendjib, the beautiful Nouredda and her accompanying party rest by a stream in a rocky desert. When Nouredda admires a flower which is growing in an inaccessible spot, Djémil, a young hunter, climbs up and picks it for her. Nouredda is thrilled and asks him to state whatever he wishes as his reward. He asks her to lift her veil so that he can see her face: in fury she orders that he be tied up and left to his fate. However, the nymph Naïla rescues him; she is in love with him and promises to help him win the hand of Nouredda.
Act 2. In the grand palace gardens, where the court of Khan is awaiting Nouredda's arrival, entertainment is offered to the guests: a solo for the favourites and a dance for Circassian slaves. A fanfare proclaims a visitor, incognito (Djémil), who proffers presents for the Khan and his bride. The visitor asks Nouredda to choose any of the gifts and she selects a jewelled flower. Djémil throws it on the ground and magically a spring gushes forth from this spot and Naïla emerges from the fountain. She dances, entrancing the Khan, who kneels in front of her and he implores her to become his wife. She consents, provided he dismisses Nouredda, who angrily goes off as the Khan leads Naïla inside the palace.
Act 3. Djémil can now pursue Nouredda but she still rejects him; so he appeals to Naïla, who says that if he gets Nouredda to love him she herself will die. Djémil agrees, and as he departs with Nouredda, Naïla disappears back into the earth and the spring dries up.

The  'Naïla' valse[edit]
Delibes was asked in 1867 to add a divertissement, known as either 'Le jardin animé' or 'Le pas des fleurs', to a revival of Adolphe Adam's ballet 'Le Corsaire'.  Part of his contribution was the waltz frequently known as the 'Naïla' waltz.  It appears that it was transferred to one of the productions of 'La Source' when it was performed under the name of 'Naïla'.  There are references to a version of that name using only Delibes's original music, although exact details are elusive.  One might assume that it was for this production that the 'Le Corsaire' divertissement found its way into the score of 'Naïla'.

La Source suites[edit]
Three orchestral suites consisting of excerpts from the ballet were arranged either by Delibes or another hand. The 2nd suite contains some music by Minkus, although the suites are attributed to Delibes.
Suite 1

a) Pas des écharpes (No. 18a, 'Pas des voiles', Delibes)
b) Variation (No. 18c, 'Variation', Delibes)
c) Scène d'amour (No. 18b, 'Andante', Delibes)
d) Danse circassienne (No. 18d, 'Danse circassienne', Delibes)
Suite 2

a) Scène dansée (A conflation of parts of No. 19, 'Scène', No. 17, 'Scène. Arrivée de Nouredda' and No. 16, 'Scène', all Delibes.)
b) Scherzo-Polka (No. 20, 'Scherzo-Polka', Delibes)
c) Pas de la guzla (No. 6a, '[Pas de la guzla] Andantino', Minkus, followed by part of No. 16, 'Scène', Delibes)
d) Marche dansée et Final (No. 23b, 'Scène', Delibes, followed by No. 24, 'Marche dansée et Final', Delibes)
Suite 3

a) Incantation (Sections 2 and 3 of No. 25, 'Scène', Delibes, arranged in reverse order)
b) Romance (Section 1 of No. 25, 'Scène', Delibes, followed by No. 26, 'Romance', Delibes)
c) Introduction et Mazurka (No. 23a, 'Nouvelle Variation de Naïla', Delibes, followed by No. 22, 'Mazurka', Delibes.)
d) Finale (Opening measures of No. 16, 'Scène', followed by No. 21, 'Grand Pas d'action', and slightly abbreviated arrangement of No. 27, 'Final'.  Delibes)
The suites contain almost all of Delibes's contribution to La Source, albeit arranged in an order designed for concert performance.

373,Špalíček,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%A0pal%C3%AD%C4%8Dek_(ballet%29,"Špalíček , Bohuslav Martinů , 1933","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Špalíček (The Chapbook or The Little Block) is a 1932 three-act folk ballet composed by Bohuslav Martinů (H. 214). It premiered in 1933 in Prague with the subtitle ""Ballet from folk games, customs, and fairytales - Ballet-revue"".[1] The title is taken from the folk-song collections hawked at fairs around Bohemia in the 1700s.[2]


Background[edit]
From a long way off he was preparing himself for theatre work: for national Czech plays, for the ballet Špalíček and the operas Hry o Marii (The Plays of Mary) and Divadlo za bránou (The Theatre beyond the Gate).[3] Špalíček was Martinů's principal theatrical project of the first half of the 1930s.[4] It is possible that Martinů was influenced by his teacher Roussel's opéra-ballet Padmâvatî or by Stravinsky's L'Histoire du soldat.[2] Martinů worked out the scenario himself, basing it on recollections of fairy tales from his childhood. The structure of one unrelated story leading to another was influenced by the pantomime ballet Z pohádky do pohádky by Oskar Nedbal, first performed in Prague in 1908.[2] References to village customs local to his birthplace would recur in works such as Kytice (Bouquet of Flowers) of 1937, the Zbojnické písně (Brigands songs) of 1957, and the four folk cantatas of 1955-59.[2] The work was composed in Paris in 1931 and completed in February 1932.[5]
The first version of Špalíček was for chamber orchestra, but in 1940, alongside alterations, he re-scored it for larger forces. The Spectre's Bride (Svatebni Kosíle), a cantata for soprano, tenor, bass and mixed chorus, titled 'Ballad after K J Erben's poem' was originally the final part of Špalíček but was dropped from the ballet mainly since it made the performance too long.[6]
The first version lasts around two hours and 10 minutes, and requires double woodwind, two each horns, trumpets, trombones, timpani and percussion, piano, and strings.[5] The revised version, made by the composer in 1940, premiered at the Národní divadlo in Prague on 2 April 1949, conducted by Václav Kašlík (1917-1989), lasts around 100 minutes, with extra wind and brass.[5] The autograph scores are kept respectively at the Czech National Museum of Music in Prague, and at the BM Memorial museum in Polička, the composer's birthplace.[5]
Soon after the first production opened at the National Theatre in Prague on 19 September 1933, conducted by Josef Charvát (1884-1945),[5] a rival production opened in Brno which ran for four years in repertory.[2] It has been revived over the years at the Prague National Theatre and elsewhere in Czechia and in Slovakia, and was recorded in 1988.
The work won Martinů the Bedřich Smetana prize for composition in 1934. Grove describes the ballet as “an extended and brilliant evocation of folk customs that includes episodes amounting to miniature operas”.[4]
Martinů's Nový Špalíček H.288 is not related to the ballet, being a song cycle set to Moravian folk poetry dating from 1942 for voice and piano. The prize-winning 1947 animated puppet feature film by Jiří Trnka titled Špalíček is often translated as The Czech Year and consists of fairy-tales.

Scenario[edit]
In the prologue a chorus of children play four song and dance games where the fairy tale action is danced while singers narrate the stories. which include the chicken and a hen; the former chokes on a large grain of corn and needs to swallow it with water. The hen tries the spring, dress-maker and tailor, but heaven sends the water to save the chicken's life. Then comes Puss in Boots, again with much dance, but no chorus. Three children's games follow: the maidens, the water-sprite, and the wolf.
Act II depicts the story of the Cobbler and Death: an old shoemaker falls out with his neighbours and leaves his home. A butterfly leads him to a black tower in which a princess is held prisoner by a giant. Between them the butterfly and cobbler free the princess and he wins a sack inside of which is death; as long as he wanders abroad with death no one dies, but, exhausted he arrives at heaven and the sack is opened. This tale is mostly danced.
Act III opens with the legend of Dorothea of Caesarea where the girl is killed by a crowd, but the mood changes for Cinderella set in a Czech village, finishing with waltzes to be danced at her wedding.

Music[edit]
The ballet makes use of Bohemian/Moravian folk music with Martinů's characteristic scoring. Brian Large describes the music as “tuneful, exciting and eminently danceable” which shows a “flair for writing for the stage”.[2] Šafránek terms the work the “form of a revue in which scenes follow each other in quick succession and the choreography and music are most effectively combined”.[7]

Recordings[edit]
Complete on Supraphon (SU 3925-2): Anna Kratochvílová (soprano), Miroslav Kopp (tenor), Richard Novák (bass), Kantilena Children's chorus (Chorus master Ján Sedláček), Kühn Female Chorus, Chorus master Pavel Kühn, Brno Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by František Jílek, recorded at the Stadion Studio, Brno in 1988.
Suites have been recorded by the Brno State Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Jiří Waldhans (Supraphon, 1979) and Charles Mackerras (Conifer, 1991)

Spartacus (Russian: «Спартак», Spartak) is a ballet by Aram Khachaturian (1903–1978). The work follows the exploits of Spartacus, the leader of the slave uprising against the Romans known as the Third Servile War, although the ballet's storyline takes considerable liberties with the historical record. Khachaturian composed Spartacus in 1954, and was awarded a Lenin Prize for the composition that same year.[1] It was first staged in Leningrad on 27 December 1956, as choreographed by Leonid Yakobson, for the Kirov Theatre of Opera and Ballet (Mariinsky Theatre),[2] where it stayed in repertory for many years,[3] but only with qualified success since Yakobson abandoned conventional pointe in his choreography.[4] Yakobson restaged his version for the Bolshoi in 1962 and it was part of the Bolshoi's 1962 tour to New York. The ballet received its first staging at the Bolshoi Theatre, Moscow in 1958, choreographed by Igor Moiseyev; however it was the 1968 production, choreographed by Yury Grigorovich, which achieved the greatest acclaim for the ballet.[3]
Spartacus remains one of Khachaturian's best known works and is prominent within the repertoires of the Bolshoi Theatre and other ballet companies in Russia and the former Soviet Union.


Synopsis[edit]
Principal characters:

Crassus, Roman consul
Spartacus, captive king of Thrace
Phrygia, wife of Spartacus
Aegina, concubine to Crassus
Act I[edit]
Ivan Vasiliev in an extract from Spartacus during re-opening gala of the Bolshoi Theatre, 28 October 2011
The Roman consul Crassus returns to Rome from his latest conquests in a triumphal procession. Among his captives are the Thracian king Spartacus and his wife Phrygia. Spartacus laments his captivity and bids a bitter farewell to Phrygia, who is taken off to join Crassus's harem of concubines. To entertain Crassus and his entourage, Spartacus is sent into the gladiatorial ring and is forced to kill a close friend. Horrified at his deed, Spartacus incites his fellow captives to rebellion.

Act II[edit]
The escaped captives celebrate their freedom. Meanwhile, Crassus entertains the Roman patricians with lavish entertainment. Spartacus and the other escaped captives disrupt the orgy and rescue the slave women, including Phrygia. Aegina insists that Crassus pursue the slave army immediately. The lovers celebrate their escape to the ""Adagio of Spartacus and Phrygia"".

Act III[edit]
Aegina discovers Spartacus's camp and observes the lovers emerging from their tent the next morning. Aegina sends word to Crassus, who sends his army in pursuit. Internecine struggles break out among Spartacus's forces. Finally, Crassus's forces discover Spartacus and impale him upon their spears. Spartacus's closest followers recover his body and carry it off while Phrygia mourns her loss.

Le Spectre de la rose (The Spirit of the Rose) is a short ballet about a young girl who dreams of dancing with the spirit of a souvenir rose from her first ball.[1] The ballet was written by Jean-Louis Vaudoyer who based the story on a verse by Théophile Gautier and used the music of Carl Maria von Weber's piano piece Aufforderung zum Tanz (Invitation to the Dance) as orchestrated by Hector Berlioz.
The ballet premiered in Monte Carlo on 19 April 1911, produced by the Ballets Russes ballet company.  Michel Fokine was the choreographer and Léon Bakst designed the original Biedermeier sets and costumes. Nijinsky danced The Rose and Tamara Karsavina danced the Young Girl. It was a great success. Spectre became internationally famous for the spectacular leap Nijinsky made through a window at the ballet's end.

In 1911, Ballets Russes producer Sergei Diaghilev hoped to present Nijinsky's ballet L'Après-midi d'un faune. It was not ready for the stage, so he needed another ballet to take its place. That ballet was the idea of writer Jean-Louis Vaudoyer. In 1910, he had sent an idea for a ballet to Ballets Russes set and costume designer Léon Bakst. His idea was based on ""Le Spectre de la rose"", a verse by Théophile Gautier, and Aufforderung zum Tanz, a work for piano by Carl Maria von Weber and orchestrated by Hector Berlioz in 1841. Diaghilev liked Vaudoyer's idea. He thought it could easily take the place of Faune. He put Vaudoyer's idea into development at once.[1][2] Diaghilev liked the idea of a ballet based on Gautier's ""Spectre"" because it could be tied to the centennial of Gautier's birth.[3]

Synopsis[edit]
The curtain rises on a girl's bedroom. The Young Girl comes into the room dressed in a white bonnet and ball gown. She has returned to her home after her first ball. She holds a rose as a souvenir of the evening. She drops into a chair and falls asleep. The rose falls from her fingers to the floor. The Spirit of the Rose is seen at the window. He steps to the floor and nears The Young Girl. Still asleep, she rises and dances with him. He leads her back to the chair, kisses her, then leaps through the window and into the night. The Young Girl awakes and rises. She picks up the rose she dropped and kisses it. The curtain falls.[4][5]

Music[edit]
In 1819, Carl Maria von Weber wrote a work for piano called Aufforderung zum Tanz. He also wrote a program for this work about a young man and woman who meet, dance, and part at a ball. The quiet music at the opening of Aufforderung leads to some beautiful (and busy) waltz tunes before the work ends with the opening music.[6]  In 1841, Hector Berlioz orchestrated Aufforderung. This version of the music was used for a short ballet in Weber's opera Der Freischütz at the Paris Opéra.[7] It was the Berlioz version of the original piano piece that was used for the ballet Le Spectre de la rose.

Premiere[edit]
Interior of the Monte Carlo Casino, 1879. The Casino theatre later became the Opera House.Spectre was premiered on 19 April 1911 by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the Théâtre de Monte Carlo, Monte Carlo. Tamara Karsavina danced The Young Girl and Nijinsky danced The Rose.[8] Grace Robert writes that Spectre was an ""immediate success"".[4] Diaghilev was surprised; he thought Spectre a trifle not worth notice, but the little ballet became one of the most loved productions of the Ballets Russes.[9]
Dance[edit]
Michel Fokine completed the dance in three or four rehearsals. He later wrote that the ballet was almost an improvisation.[10] Grace Robert writes in The Borzoi Book of Ballets that Spectre is a pas de deux but not the sort of pas de deux that looks back to complex 19th-century technique and virtuosity. Instead, it is a forward-looking, modern dance of continuous movement and expressiveness.[11]
Fokine dropped the port de bras of classical ballet in designing the dances for Nijinsky. He used instead curving, tendril-like movements of the arms and fingers. Nijinsky became an androgynous character in this ballet, one showing masculine power in his legs and a feminine delicacy in his arms.[12] Some of his gestures, Ostwalt writes in Nijinsky: A Leap into Madness, ""lent a feminine aura"" to the character.[13]

Nijinsky's costume[edit]
Nijinsky in the rose petal costume
Nijinsky's silk elastic costume was designed by Léon Bakst. The costume was covered with silk rose petals. Nijinsky was stitched into the costume for every show.[14] After every show, the wardrobe mistress would touch up the petals with her curling iron.[14]
Nijinsky's make-up was an important part of the costume design. Romula de Pulszky, later to be his wife, wrote that he looked like ""a celestial insect, his eyebrows suggesting some beautiful beetle"".[15] Ostwald writes that Nijinsky's costume was like a ballerina's.[13]
Sometimes, petals would become loose and fall to the stage floor. Nijinsky's servant Vasili would collect the petals and sell them as souvenirs. It was said that he built a large house called Le Château du Spectre de la Rose with the profits from the sale of the petals.[16]

Nijinsky's leap[edit]
The ballet became famous for Nijinsky's leap through one of the two large windows at the back of the stage. The height of the leap was an illusion though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The skirting board (base board) under the window was very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it actually was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one in the audience saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would soar on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the penultimate chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.[1]

Other productions[edit]
Since the ballet's creation, many male dancers have interpreted the role of The Rose, but it is generally perceived that none have truly matched Nijinsky's brilliance, partly because the ballet had been specially designed to suit his particular talents.[4][17]  The Young Girl has been called ""the forgotten woman of ballet"", and, as time has passed, the part has become routine.[18] By the middle of the 20th century, Spectre had become nothing but a stunt ballet: people paid only to see the leap through the window.[19]
Spectre was one of the first ballets Rudolph Nureyev danced in the West after leaving Russia. This was for German television in 1961. He first danced The Rose on stage (24 times) in New York City for the Joffrey Ballet's Diaghilev program in 1979. Spectre was the last ballet Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn danced together. That was in June 1979, when the ballerina was 60. He danced The Rose in Paris in 1981 and 1982, and last danced the part in August 1987 at the London Coliseum with the Nancy Ballet.[20]
The ballet was first seen in Australia in 1936 when it was part of the Monte Carlo Russian Ballet program.[21] In 1962, Margot Fonteyn danced The Young Girl as part of her 1962 tour of Australia.[21] In 2006, The Australian Ballet presented the ballet as one of three showing the work of Fokine.[21][22]

Tribute[edit]
A unique pink diamond discovered and cut in Moscow and valued by the Gemological Institute of America at a minimum of $60 million was named “Le Spectre de la Rose” as a tribute to a legendary Russian ballet miniature.[23][24]

1912 ballet-pantomime
Mado Minty in The Spider's Feast, 1927.
The Spider's Feast (Le Festin de l'araignée), Op. 17, is a 1912 ""ballet-pantomime"" with music by the French composer Albert Roussel (1869–1937) to a scenario by Gilbert de Voisins.


The ballet[edit]
The ballet depicts insect life in a garden, evoked by the flute solo at the opening and close of the work, and where insects are trapped in the spider's web, but when the spider prepares to begin its feast, it in turn is killed by a praying mantis. The funeral procession of the mayfly concludes the work. The full ballet lasts approximately half an hour.

Performance history[edit]
The work was premiered at the Théâtre des Arts in Paris on 3 April 1913 with Mlle Sahary-Djali in the title role, choreography by Léo Staats and design by Maxime Dethomas. It was revived at the Opéra-Comique on 5 December 1922 with Mado Minty as the spider and entered the repertoire of the Paris Opéra on 1 May 1939 with Suzanne Lorcia.[1]
Typical of Roussel's earlier works, the music is impressionistic, much in the style of his countrymen Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel. It is lushly orchestrated. Composed to order in only two months, the music was highly regarded for its ""inventive counterpoints, bounding scherzos, gay and uneven rhythms, and personal instrumentation, both caressing and vigorous"".[2]
The symphonic fragments from the full score were first recorded in 1928 with the composer conducting (his only recording). Walter Straram and his Orchestre des Concerts Straram made a recording for Columbia in March 1930. Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony Orchestra performed this orchestral suite during a broadcast concert in NBC Studio 8-H on 7 April 1946.[3] Charles Munch and the London Philharmonic Orchestra in June 1947 recorded the work for Decca and Louis Fourestier conducting the Orchestre du Théâtre national de l'Opéra recorded it for Pathé in October 1948.[4] In 1952, Rene Leibowitz recorded the suite with the Paris Philharmonic Orchestra and in 1953 the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under Paul Paray recorded it for Mercury. Ernest Ansermet and the Suisse Romande Orchestra made the first complete recording of the ballet in 1954. Georges Prêtre recorded this same music with the Orchestre National de France for EMI in 1984. A recording by Christoph Eschenbach and the Orchestre de Paris was released on Ondine in 2008.

Instrumentation[edit]
The scoring includes 2 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (one doubling cor anglais), 2 clarinets in A, 2 bassoons; 2 horns in F (chromatiques), 2 trumpets in C; timpani, one percussion (cymbal, triangle, tambourine); celeste, harps; strings.

This article is about Balanchine's 1957 ballet. For an article about the differences between traditional square dance and modern Western square dance, see Square dance.
Square Dance is a ballet made by New York City Ballet co-founder and balletmaster 
George Balanchine to Antonio Vivaldi's Concerto Grosso in B minor and the first movement of his Concerto Grosso in E major, Op. 3, nos. 10 and 12, respectively; in 1976 he added Arcangelo Corelli's Sarabanda, Badinerie e Giga, second and third movements. The premiere took place on November 21, 1957, at City Center of Music and Drama, New York, with lighting by Nananne Porcher. The original version placed the musicians on stage with a square dance caller calling the steps; from its 1976 revival the caller was eliminated, the orchestra placed in the pit, and a solo added for the premier danseur to the Corelli Sarabanda. The Pacific Northwest Ballet restored the caller for one performance at the 2007 Vail International Dance Festival.

Stars and Stripes is a neoclassical ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to music by John Philip Sousa, orchestrated by Hershy Kay. The ballet was made as a tribute to the United States, Balanchine's adopted country. It premiered on January 17, 1958, at the City Center of Music and Drama, danced by the New York City Ballet. It is dedicated to Fiorello La Guardia, former mayor of New York City. The ballet had been revived by multiple ballet companies, and at different special occasions.


Background and production[edit]
Suki Schorer and New York City Ballet dancers in Stars and Stripes
Choreographer and New York City Ballet co-founder George Balanchine, who was raised in Imperial Russia and worked in Europe during his early career, moved to the United States in 1933 and became an American citizen in 1940. He later conceived the idea of Stars and Stripes, as a tribute to his adopted country.[1]
Balanchine chose to use music by John Philip Sousa, who was best known for writing military marches.[2]: 143–144  When asked about the unusual choice of music, Balanchine only responded, ""I like Sousa's music. It makes me feel good.""[3]: 256  Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the New York City Ballet, wrote, ""The ballet was conceived as a musical joke, Stars and Stripes was generally received as such, then and since.""[2]: 144  Apart from Sousa's martial marches, the music of Stars and Stripes also included an opera and other lesser known pieces.[2]: 144  Hershy Kay, who had previously orchestrated music for ballet Western Symphony, was brought in to orchestrate Sousa's music, which was written for brass instruments only.[1]
The costumes and sets were designed by Karinska and David Hays respectively.[4] The sets include a black backdrop, rather than blue, which is used in many of Balanchine's works. Another backdrop used is a large flag of the United States.[5] The ballet is dedicated to Fiorello La Guardia, former mayor of New York City.[1]

Choreography[edit]
Stars and Stripes has five sections, each called a ""campaign"".[6] Once, Balanchine was asked whether Stars and Stripes has a story. He said yes, and when asked what is the story, he replied, ""The United States"".[7]  Balanchine called the ballet a ""balletic parade"", with four groups called ""regiments"".[4] He also admitted Stars and Stripes is what he called ""the applause machine"", and noted ""calculated vulgarity is a useful ingredient"".[8] In total, the ballet is danced by 27 women and 14 men. Sandra Jennings from the Balanchine Trust noted the ballet is ""difficult"" for the corps de ballet.[6] On the whole ballet, dance critic John Martin commented, ""With the spirit of Sousa in the pit, the military march inevitably takes over the doings on stage, We see it in virtually every variety – drilling, parade strutting, drum-majoretting. There are high kicks galore, 'heel stretches,' tricks out of the circus and lifts… Everybody salutes at the slightest provocation.""[9]
The first campaign, set to ""Corcoran Cadets"", starts with twelve women on stage.  Their leader then enters with a majorette baton and marches, a moment dance critic John Gruen called ""the image of the all-American girl"".[1] The women march while the leader performs different steps. The section ends with the corps de ballet marching towards the audience then offstage, followed by the leader.[1]
The second campaign, to ""Rifle Regiments"", is danced by a female corps de ballet and a leader. Taller dancers are cast in this section. Therefore, as Gruen wrote, ""Their jolly marching and intricate patterns have a more broadly sweeping character.""[1]
The third campaign is set to ""Thunder and Gladiator"", and performed by an all-male group.[1] Dance critic Jennifer Dunning wrote, ""men's flying stage-crosses, giving the tumultuous stage a fixed center in the regiment's spinning leader.""[10] At the end of the section, the dancers salute the audience.[1] Jennings said that everyone in this section has  ""to be like a soloist"" and ""able to do the kind of steps that are asked of a soloist.""[6]
The fourth campaign, to ""The Liberty Bell"" and ""El Capitan"", is a pas de deux that was described as ""showy"" by author Robert Greskovic,[11] and follows the structure of a classical pas de deux. Martin wrote that this section ""goes for virtually impossible bravura"".[9] Kirstein wrote that Balanchine created the pas de deux as ""a tribute to Dwight Eisenhower, in his senior year at West Point, engaged to Mamie Doud."" Balanchine had specifically asked Hershay Kay to use brass instruments in this section, rather than the violin.[2]: 144 
The fifth campaign, set to ""The Stars and Stripes Forever"", starts with dancers from the first two regiments returning to the stage one by one, joined by the third regiment, before the dancers from the fourth campaign enter.[1] Gruen described, ""Patriotic fervor overtakes everyone, and as the regiments parade, the leading couple stand at opposite sides of the stage to review them."" The backdrop is switched to a large American flag. The ballet ends with the ballerina of the fourth campaign lifted by her partner, and with the full cast, ""forms a victoriously patriotic tableau"".[1]

Original cast[edit]
The principal dancers at the premiere of Stars and Stripes were:[9]

Allegra Kent
Diana Adams
Melissa Hayden
Robert Barnett
Jacques d'Amboise
Performances[edit]
Stars and Stripes premiered on January 17, 1958, at the City Center of Music and Drama.[4] In 1976, Stars and Stripes was placed in the New York City Ballet program Entente Cordiale, along with Union Jack, Balanchine's homage to the United Kingdom, and Tricolore, a tribute to France that was conceived by Balanchine and choreographed by Jerome Robbins, Peter Martins and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux.[12]
Stars and Stripes was performed at special occasions, including Nelson Rockefeller's inauguration as Governor of New York.[2]: 157  In 1964, the New York City Ballet performed Stars and Stripes at the opening of the New York State Theater.[13] In 1981, following the end of the Iran hostage crisis, Balanchine had the New York City Ballet to perform the finale of Stars and Stripes as a surprise encore at the New York State Theater, with the dancers wearing yellow ribbons.[14] In 1984, the Dance Theatre of Harlem performed the finale of Stars and Stripes at the Olympics closing ceremony in Los Angeles.[15]
Other ballet companies that have performed Stars and Stripes include the American Ballet Theatre,[16] San Francisco Ballet,[17] the Pacific Northwest Ballet,[18] The Washington Ballet,[6] Miami City Ballet,[19] Suzanne Farrell Ballet,[20] Dance Theatre of Harlem.[21] BalletMet,[22] Sarasota Ballet,[23] Sacramento Ballet,[24] Ballet San Jose[25] and City Ballet of San Diego.[26] The School of American Ballet, the affiliated school of the New York City Ballet, had also performed the ballet.[27] According to a 2013 report from The Washington Post, Stars and Stripes is performed less often in recent years due to the number of dancers in the ballet and the techniques required from the corps de ballet.[6]

Videography[edit]
In 1993, the fourth and fifth ""campaigns"" of Stars and Stripes was filmed for the broadcast ""The Balanchine Celebration"", featuring dancers Margaret Tracey, Damian Woetzel, Katrina Killian and Gen Horiuchi.[11]

In popular culture[edit]
In 1996, Robert La Fosse made a parody of Stars and Stripes titled Stars & Stripes Forever for Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo, an all-male drag ballet troupe.[4][28]
In 2000, an excerpt of Stars and Stripes was featured in the film Center Stage, danced by Julie Kent and Ethan Stiefel.[29]

The Steadfast Tin Soldier is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Bizet's Jeux d'enfants, based on Hans Christian Andersen's 1838 fairytale of the same name of the love between a tin soldier and a paper-doll ballerina. The ballet premiered on July 30, 1975, at the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, with New York City Ballet's Patricia McBride and Peter Schaufuss.[1][2]

Production[edit]
George Balanchine first used Bizet's Jeux d'enfants for a 1955 project, in collaboration with choreographers Barbara Milberg and Francisco Moncion, danced by Melissa Hayden and Roy Tobias. It was revived four years later, with the choreography only credited to Balanchine.[1]
The 1975 version, a pas de deux, was commissioned by the Saratoga Performing Arts Center, where the New York City Ballet performs annually, and premiered on Bizet's centennial year, performed by Patricia McBride and Peter Schaufuss. The ballet uses sets and costumes designed by David Mitchell.[1] After he made The Steadfast Tin Soldier, Balanchine, who had adapted Andersen fairytales before, said what attracted him to fairytales by Andersen was the ""underlying Christian substructure"".[3] The 1975 ballet premiered in New York City the following year.[4]
In 2020, in response to the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, the New York City Ballet released a 2014 video recording of The Steadfast Tin Soldier, featuring Erica Pereira and Daniel Ulbricht.[5]

Still Life at the Penguin Cafe is a ballet choreographed by David Bintley and featuring music composed by Simon Jeffes, founder of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra.  It is also the title of the accompanying album.  Geoffrey Richardson co-wrote one of the pieces.[1]
The ballet's debut production in 1988 was performed by The Royal Ballet at Covent Garden, in England. The ballet was conceived by David Bintley (at that time resident choreographer at Covent Garden), who approached Simon Jeffes about the music that was to be used in the choreography. The music for the ballet was drawn from several musical pieces composed by Jeffes before the ballet was conceived, composed during the period 1981 to 1987. Most of the pieces were originally written for small ensembles, consisting of, for example, violin, cello, guitar and piano. Jeffes orchestrated the pieces for the ballet, and in the Royal Ballet production, they were performed by a full orchestra. The ballet was filmed in 1988 by Thames Television and commercially released. The name of the ballet is derived from that of the Penguin Cafe Orchestra, which was Simon Jeffes' ensemble.


Ballet story[edit]
The pieces / sections in the ballet are:[2]

The Penguin Cafe (musical piece Air à Danser)
Utah Longhorn Ram (musical piece Prelude and Yodel)
Texan Kangaroo Rat (musical piece Long Distance, original title Horns of a Bull)
Humboldt's Hog Nosed Skunk Flea (musical piece Pythagoras's Trousers)
Southern Cape Zebra (SCZ) (musical piece White Mischief)
Rain Forest People (musical piece Now Nothing)
Brazilian Woolly Monkey (musical piece Music By Numbers)
Conclusion (musical piece Numbers 1–4)
Story line[edit]
The ballet begins with a voice-over (by Jeremy Irons) describing how the great auk was very recently made extinct by man. The initial segment is set in a cafe, and several humans and penguins dance. Each subsequent segment prior to the conclusion shows an endangered species (or, in the case of the Rain Forest People, a culture.) The conclusion shows all the characters withstanding a downpour, and gathering on an ark-like boat.
The overall theme of the ballet is pro-environment, pro-conservation. The ballet seeks to make the audience more aware of endangered species.

Neoclassical ballet


Stravinsky Violin ConcertoChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicIgor StravinskyPremiereJune 18, 1972 (1972-06-18)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletGenreneoclassical ballet
Stravinsky Violin Concerto, originally titled Violin Concerto, is a neoclassical ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Stravinsky's Violin Concerto. Balanchine had previously choreographed another ballet to the concerto in 1941 for the Original Ballet Russe, titled Balustrade, though it was not revived following a few performances. He then reused the concerto for New York City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival in 1972, a tribute to the composer following his death. The ballet premiered on June 18, 1972, at the New York State Theater.


Background and production[edit]
Balanchine first choreographed a work to Stravinsky's Violin Concerto in 1941 for the Wassily de Basil's company Original Ballet Russe, titled Balustrade, with costumes and sets designed by Pavel Tchelitchew.[1]: 125  In his previous Stravinsky ballets, Balanchine usually followed a plot. However, Balustrade is completely plotless, and was Balanchine's response to the Violin Concerto.[2] The ballet premiered on January 22, 1941 at Fifty-first Street Theatre, New York, with a cast led by Tamara Toumanova, Paul Petroff and Roman Jasinski.[3]: 403  Stravinsky himself conducted while Samuel Dushkin played the violin. Balustrade had only been performed three times.[4][5] However, Stravinsky called it ""one of the most satisfactory visualisations of any of my works"".[2]
Balanchine and Stravinsky continued to collaborate frequently until the latter's death in 1971. Balanchine then planned to have his company, the New York City Ballet, to hold a week-long Stravinsky Festival in June 1972, as a tribute to the composer.[6] The festival featured 20 premieres,[6] seven choreographed by Balanchine.[3]: 317  Balanchine reused Stravinsky's Violin Concerto for one of the new works, at the time titled Violin Concerto.[3]: 321  By then, he had preferred to use the titles composers gave to their music. When biographer Bernard Taper asked about Balustrade, Balanchine responded, ""Stravinsky never wrote Balustrade; he wrote Violin Concerto. The ballet should be announced as what it is. Then the musician can come, the young people who love music and who want to hear the composition – they'll know what they're getting. They don't have to look at the ballet if it bores them, they can just listen to the music. And that's fine with me, that's wonderful.""[3]: 321  The ballet had since been retitled as Stravinsky Violin Concerto.[7]
Karin von Aroldingen, a member of the original cast who had danced with the New York City Ballet for ten years, said in Stravinsky Violin Concerto, ""Balanchine used everything I had for the first time."" Peter Martins, who joined the two years prior, said, ""Violin Concerto was my chance to show that I could dance 'Balanchine'.""[1]: 275  Unlike Balustrade, the dancers in Stravinsky Violin Concerto are dressed in practice clothes,[8] with the women in leotards and black footless tights, men in white T-shirts and black tights.[7]
Stravinsky Violin Concerto was regarded as one of the ""masterworks"" out of the festival.[1]: 275 [3]: 317  After Balanchine died, the world rights of Stravinsky Violin Concerto and five other ballets went to von Aroldingen.[1]: 318 

Choreography[edit]
Stravinsky Violin Concerto is Balanchine's direct response to the music.[6] In the opening Toccata, the four lead dancers, each grouped with a four-person corps de ballet, are introduced one by one. Dance critic Zoe Anderson wrote that this section is ""bright and exuberant"".[7]
It is followed by Aria I, created on Karin von Aroldingen and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux. Though von Aroldingen saw herself as a ""realistic dancer,"" Balanchine asked her to dance like a snake, ""You know, a bit sneaky."" Dance critic Richard Buckle commented, ""The opening chord on the strings warns that the relationship between this man and woman will not be a placid one. Her dance with her partner contains strange confrontations, tangles, stalking, catching, trapping; but she somersaults away from his last embrace, and he suddenly lies flat, as if he had enough.""[1]: 276 
Aria II was made on Kay Mazzo and Peter Martins. Both of them found it difficult to learn the choreography, though it was not noticed by the audience. Mazzo noted it was because Balanchine knew what was the most suitable her and Martins.[1]: 276  Anderson described, ""The ballerina clings to her partner, wrapping herself around him then standing sheltered in his arms. At the end of the movement he kneels and she leans against him, his arm curved over her like a blindfold.""[7]
The ballet ends with a Capriccio featuring the cast of twenty dancers,[1]: 276  entering the stage in groups of ten,[9] dancing what Anderson called ""lively, folk-flavoured steps, skipping on their heels and hopping to Stravinsky's intricate rhythms"". Once the entire cast is onstage, the dancers ""bursts into the finale"".[7]

Performances[edit]
Stravinsky Violin Concerto premiered on June 18, 1972 at the New York State Theater,[7] on the first program of the Stravinsky Festival.[6] Other ballet companies that had revived Stravinsky Violin Concerto include The Royal Ballet,[10] American Ballet Theatre,[11] San Francisco Ballet,[12] Dutch National Ballet,[13] National Ballet of Canada,[14] Birmingham Royal Ballet,[15] Pacific Northwest Ballet[16] and Boston Ballet.[17]

Videography[edit]
Stravinsky Violin Concerto was filmed for PBS's 1977 Dance in America broadcast, with original cast members Mazzo, von Aroldingen and Martins reprising their roles, while the role made on Bonnefous was danced by Bart Cook. Balanchine adjusted the choreography for the cameras.[18][19]
In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the New York City Ballet released a 2018 video recording of the finale of Stravinsky Violin Concerto, featuring Sterling Hyltin, Ask la Cour, Sara Mearns and Taylor Stanley, in his New York City debut of the role.[20] A full recording of the ballet with the same cast was released online in March 2021.[21]

Suite of Dances is a ballet made by New York City Ballet ballet master Jerome Robbins from his 1974 Dybbuk Variations, which was itself a ""cut"" version of his Dybbuk from the same year. Suite of Dances' premiere took place on 17 January 1980 at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center. The eponymous 1974 music to all three versions is that of Leonard Bernstein.

The Sun Also Rises or Hemingway: The Sun Also Rises is a 2013 ballet adaptation of Ernest Hemingway's 1926 novel The Sun Also Rises that was premiered by The Washington Ballet at The Kennedy Center under Artistic Director Septime Webre,[1] whose parents had known Hemingway.[2] It is the first version of this work en pointe.[3] It premiered from May 8 – 12, 2013.[4] Webre had previously adapted The Great Gatsby and Alice in Wonderland to ballet.[2][5] According to Emily Cary of The Washington Examiner, like the source, the plot is about ""a group of American and British expatriates who meet in Paris and travel to Pamplona, Spain, to watch the running of the bulls and the bullfights.""[6]  Clark notes that the production was inspired by one of Webre's friends who taught American literature at Yale University who suggested an adaptation.[6]


Cast and crew[edit]
The original cast featured Jared Nelson, Sona Kharatian, Brooklyn Mack and Jonathan Jordan in the roles of Jake Barnes, Lady Brett Ashley, Pedro Romero, and Bill Gorton, respectively.[7] After reading the book, Webre wrote the libretto along with librettist Karen Zacarias and hired Billy Novick to write the music.[2][6] Hugh Landwehr of New York University was the set designer. University of Maryland Department of Theatre professor Helen Huang was the costume designer.[6] Clifton Taylor was the lighting designer [8]

Critical review[edit]
Alistair Macaulay of The New York Times noted that he had cynical expectations, but in the end felt that ""Although I think this dance drama eventually doesn’t quite succeed, what’s impressive is how near it comes to doing so.""[1]  Sarah Kaufman of The Washington Post described the performance as ""surprisingly restrained"" and ""lively and entertaining, if flawed"".[9]

Swan Lake (Russian: Лебеди́ное о́зеро, tr. Lebedínoje ózero, IPA: [lʲɪbʲɪˈdʲinəjə ˈozʲɪrə] listenⓘ), Op. 20, is a ballet composed by Russian composer Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky in 1875–76.  Despite its initial failure, it is now one of the most popular ballets of all time.[1]
The scenario, initially in two acts, was fashioned from Russian and German folk tales and tells the story of Odette, a princess turned into a swan by an evil sorcerer's curse. The choreographer of the original production was Julius Reisinger (Václav Reisinger). The ballet was premiered by the Bolshoi Ballet on 4 March [O.S. 20 February] 1877[2][3] at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. Although it is presented in many different versions, most ballet companies base their stagings both choreographically and musically on the 1895 revival of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, first staged for the Imperial Ballet on 15 January 1895, at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg. For this revival, Tchaikovsky's score was revised by the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatre's chief conductor and composer Riccardo Drigo.[4]

Origins of the ballet[edit]
There is no evidence to prove who wrote the original libretto, or where the idea for the plot came from. Russian and German folk tales have been proposed as possible sources, including ""The Stolen Veil"" by Johann Karl August Musäus, but both those tales differ significantly from the ballet.[5]
One theory is that the original choreographer, Julius Reisinger, who was a Bohemian (and therefore likely to be familiar with ""The Stolen Veil""), created the story.[6] Another theory is that it was written by Vladimir Petrovich Begichev, director of the Moscow Imperial Theatres at the time, possibly with Vasily Geltser, danseur of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre (a surviving copy of the libretto bears his name). Since the first published libretto does not correspond with Tchaikovsky's music in many places, one theory is that the first published version was written by a journalist after viewing initial rehearsals (new opera and ballet productions were always reported in the newspapers, along with their respective scenarios).
Some contemporaries of Tchaikovsky recalled the composer taking great interest in the life story of Bavarian King Ludwig II, whose life had supposedly been marked by the sign of Swan and could have been the prototype of the dreamer Prince Siegfried.[7]
Begichev commissioned the score of Swan Lake from Tchaikovsky in May 1875 for 800 rubles. Tchaikovsky worked with only a basic outline from Julius Reisinger of the requirements for each dance.[8] Unlike the instructions for the scores of The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, none of the original written instruction was thought to have survived. Most of what scholars knew about information such as choreography came from gossip and reviews of the performance.[9] However, rehearsal notes dating as early as 1876 have been recently discovered in the Institute for Art Studies in Moscow, revealing more information about what the original 1877 production may have looked like.[10]

Tchaikovsky's influences[edit]
From around the time of the turn of the 19th century until the beginning of the 1890s, scores for ballets were almost always written by composers known as ""specialists"" who were highly skilled at scoring the light, decorative, melodious, and rhythmically clear music that was at that time in vogue for ballet. Tchaikovsky studied the music of ""specialists"" such as the Italian Cesare Pugni and the Austrian Ludwig Minkus, before setting to work on Swan Lake.
Tchaikovsky had a rather negative opinion of the ""specialist"" ballet music until he studied it in detail, being impressed by the nearly limitless variety of infectious melodies their scores contained. Tchaikovsky most admired the ballet music of such composers as Léo Delibes, Adolphe Adam, and later, Riccardo Drigo. He would later write to his protégé, the composer Sergei Taneyev, ""I listened to the Delibes ballet Sylvia ... what charm, what elegance, what wealth of melody, rhythm, and harmony. I was ashamed, for if I had known of this music then, I would not have written Swan Lake."" Tchaikovsky most admired Adam's 1844 score for Giselle, which used the Leitmotif technique: associating certain themes with certain characters or moods, a technique he would use in Swan Lake and, later, The Sleeping Beauty.
Tchaikovsky drew on previous compositions for his Swan Lake score. According to two of Tchaikovsky's relatives – his nephew Yuri Lvovich Davydov and his niece Anna Meck-Davydova – the composer had earlier created a little ballet called The Lake of the Swans at their home in 1871. This ballet included the famous Leitmotif, the ""Swan's Theme"" or ""Song of the Swans"". He also made use of material from The Voyevoda, an opera he had abandoned in 1868. Another number which included a theme from The Voyevoda was the Entr'acte of the fourth scene and the opening of the Finale (Act IV, No. 29). The Grand adage (a.k.a. the ""Love Duet"") from the second scene of Swan Lake was fashioned from the final love duet from his opera Undina,  abandoned in 1873.
By April 1876 the score was complete, and rehearsals began. Soon Reisinger began setting certain numbers aside that he dubbed ""undanceable."" Reisinger even began choreographing dances to other composers' music, but Tchaikovsky protested and his pieces were reinstated. Although the two artists were required to collaborate, each seemed to prefer working as independently of the other as possible.[11] At times, Tchaikovsky actually ended up turning to Alina Bryullova, a family acquaintance, for advice on how he should write music for ballet; she later recalled that due to her lack of expertise she ""could give him practically no advice.""[12]

Composition process[edit]
Tchaikovsky's excitement with Swan Lake is evident from the speed with which he composed: commissioned in the spring of 1875, the piece was created within one year. His letters to Sergei Taneyev from August 1875 indicate, however, that it was not only his excitement that compelled him to create it so quickly but his wish to finish it as soon as possible, so as to allow him to start on an opera. Respectively, he created scores of the first three numbers of the ballet, then the orchestration in the fall and winter, and was still struggling with the instrumentation in the spring. By April 1876, the work was complete. Tchaikovsky's mention of a draft suggests the presence of some sort of abstract but no such draft has ever been seen. Tchaikovsky wrote various letters to friends expressing his longstanding desire to work with this type of music, and his excitement concerning his current stimulating, albeit laborious task.[13]

Original production of 1877[edit]
The première on 4 March 1877 was given as a benefit performance for the ballerina Pelageya Karpakova (also known as Polina Karpakova), who performed the role of Odette, with première danseur Victor Gillert as Prince Siegfried. Karpakova may also have danced the part Odile, although it is believed the ballet originally called for two different dancers. It is now common practice for the same ballerina to dance both Odette and Odile.
The Russian ballerina Anna Sobeshchanskaya was originally cast as Odette, but was replaced when a governing official in Moscow complained about her, claiming she had accepted jewelry from him, only to then marry a fellow danseur and sell the pieces for cash.
The première was not well received. Though there were a few critics who recognised the virtues of the score, most considered it to be far too complicated for ballet. It was labelled ""too noisy, too 'Wagnerian' and too symphonic.""[15] The critics also thought Reisinger's choreography was ""unimaginative and altogether unmemorable.""[15] The German origins of the story were ""treated with suspicion while the tale itself was regarded as 'stupid' with unpronounceable surnames for its characters.""[15] Karpakova was a secondary soloist and ""not particularly convincing.""[15]

The poverty of the production, meaning the décor and costumes, the absence of outstanding performers, the Balletmaster's weakness of imagination, and, finally, the orchestra ... all of this together permitted (Tchaikovsky) with good reason to cast the blame for the failure on others.— Modest Tchaikovsky, brother of the composer Yet the fact remains (and is too often omitted in accounts of this initial production) that this staging survived for six years with a total of 41 performances – many more than several other ballets from the repertoire of this theatre.[16]

On 26 April 1877, Anna Sobeshchanskaya made her début as Odette/Odile in Swan Lake, and from the start, she was completely dissatisfied with the ballet. Sobeshchanskaya asked Marius Petipa—Premier Maître de Ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres—to choreograph a pas de deux to replace the pas de six in the third act (for a ballerina to request a supplemental pas or variation was standard practice in 19th-century ballet, and often these ""custom-made"" dances were the legal property of the ballerina they were composed for).
Petipa created the pas de deux to music by Ludwig Minkus, ballet composer to the St Petersburg Imperial Theatres. The piece was a standard pas de deux classique consisting of a short entrée, the grand adage, a variation for each dancer individually, and a coda.
Tchaikovsky was angered by this change, stating that whether the ballet was good or bad, he alone should be held responsible for its music. He agreed to compose a new pas de deux, but soon a problem arose: Sobeshchanskaya wanted to retain Petipa's choreography. Tchaikovsky agreed to compose a pas de deux that would match to such a degree, the ballerina would not even be required to rehearse. Sobeshchanskaya was so pleased with Tchaikovsky's new music, she requested he compose an additional variation, which he did.
Until 1953 this pas de deux was thought to be lost, until a repétiteur score was accidentally found in the archives of the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre, among orchestral parts for Alexander Gorsky's revival of Le Corsaire (Gorsky had included the piece in his version of Le Corsaire staged in 1912). In 1960 George Balanchine choreographed a pas de deux to this music for Violette Verdy and Conrad Ludlow, performed at the City Center of Music and Drama in New York City as Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux,[17] as it is still known and performed today.

Subsequent productions 1879–1894[edit]
Julius Reisinger's successor as balletmaster was Joseph Peter Hansen. Hansen made considerable efforts to salvage Swan Lake and on 13 January 1880 he presented a new production of the ballet for his own benefit performance. The part of Odette/Odile was danced by Evdokia Kalmykova, a student of the Moscow Imperial Ballet School, with Alfred Bekefi as Prince Siegfried. This production was better received than the original, but by no means a great success. Hansen presented another version of Swan Lake on 28 October 1882, again with Kalmykova as Odette/Odile. For this production Hansen arranged a Grand Pas for the ballroom scene which he titled La Cosmopolitana. This was taken from the European section of the Grand Pas d'action known as The Allegory of the Continents from Marius Petipa's 1875 ballet The Bandits to the music of Ludwig Minkus. Hansen's version of Swan Lake was given only four times, the final performance being on 2 January 1883, and soon the ballet was dropped from the repertory altogether.
In all, Swan Lake was performed 41 times between its première and the final performance of 1883 – a rather lengthy run for a ballet that was so poorly received upon its première. Hansen became Balletmaster to the Alhambra Theatre in London and on 1 December 1884 he presented a one-act ballet titled The Swans, which was inspired by the second scene of Swan Lake. The music was composed by the Alhambra Theatre's chef d'orchestre Georges Jacoby.
The second scene of Swan Lake was then presented on 21 February in Prague by the Ballet of the National Theatre in a version mounted by the Balletmaster August Berger. The ballet was given during two concerts which were conducted by Tchaikovsky. The composer noted in his diary that he experienced ""a moment of absolute happiness"" when the ballet was performed. Berger's production followed the 1877 libretto, though the names of Prince Siegfried and Benno were changed to Jaroslav and Zdeňek, with the rôle of Benno danced by a female dancer en travestie. The rôle of Prince Siegfried was danced by Berger himself with the ballerina Giulietta Paltriniera-Bergrova as Odette. Berger's production was only given eight performances and was even planned for production at the Fantasia Garden in Moscow in 1893, but it never materialised.

Petipa–Ivanov–Drigo revival of 1895[edit]

Pierina Legnani as Odette (1895)
During the late 1880s and early 1890s, Petipa and Vsevolozhsky discussed with Tchaikovsky the possibility of reviving Swan Lake.[18] However, Tchaikovsky died on 6 November 1893,[19] just when plans to revive Swan Lake were beginning to come to fruition. It remains uncertain whether Tchaikovsky was prepared to revise the music for this revival. Whatever the case, as a result of Tchaikovsky's death, Riccardo Drigo revised the score, after receiving approval from Tchaikovsky's younger brother, Modest. There are major differences between Drigo's and Tchaikovsky's scores. Today, it is Drigo's revision, and not Tchaikovsky's original score of 1877, that most ballet companies use.

Pavel Gerdt as Prince Siegfried (Mariinsky Theatre, 1895)
In February 1894, two memorial concerts planned by Vsevolozhsky were given in honor of Tchaikovsky. The production included the second act of Swan Lake, choreographed by Lev Ivanov, Second Balletmaster to the Imperial Ballet. The turnout for the revival concert was not as great as anticipated due to the mixed program as well as higher-than-usual ticket prices, leaving the theater hall half-empty. Despite the small audience, Ivanov's choreography for the memorial concert was unanimously praised by critics, and audiences received the concert with praise.[20]
The revival of Swan Lake was planned for Pierina Legnani's benefit performance in the 1894–1895 season. The death of Tsar Alexander III on 1 November 1894 and the ensuing period of official mourning brought all ballet performances and rehearsals to a close for some time, and as a result all efforts could be concentrated on the pre-production of the full revival of Swan Lake. Ivanov and Petipa collaborated on the production, with Ivanov retaining his dances for the second act while choreographing the fourth, with Petipa staging the first and third acts.
Modest Tchaikovsky was called upon to make changes to the ballet's libretto, including the character of Odette changing from a fairy swan-maiden into a cursed mortal woman, the ballet's villain changing from Odette's stepmother to the magician von Rothbart, and the ballet's finale: instead of the lovers simply drowning at the hand of Odette's stepmother as in the original 1877 scenario, Odette dies by drowning herself, with Prince Siegfried choosing to die as well, rather than live without her, and soon the lovers' spirits are reunited in an apotheosis.[21] Aside from the revision of the libretto the ballet was changed from four acts to three—with act 2 becoming act 1, scene 2.
All was ready by the beginning of 1895 and the ballet had its première on 27 January. Pierina Legnani danced Odette/Odile, with Pavel Gerdt as Prince Siegfried, Alexei Bulgakov as Rothbart, and Alexander Oblakov as Benno. Most of the reviews in the St. Petersburg newspapers were positive.
Unlike the première of The Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake did not dominate the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre in its first season. It was given only sixteen performances between the première and the 1895–1896 season, and was not performed at all in 1897. Even more surprising, the ballet was performed only four times in 1898 and 1899. The ballet belonged solely to Legnani until she left St. Petersburg for her native Italy in 1901. After her departure, the ballet was taken over by Mathilde Kschessinskaya, who was as much celebrated in the rôle as was her Italian predecessor.

Later productions[edit]
A 2008 production at the Royal Swedish Opera
Throughout the performance history of Swan Lake, the 1895 edition has served as the version on which most stagings have been based. Nearly every balletmaster or choreographer who has re-staged Swan Lake has made modifications to the ballet's scenario, while still maintaining much of the traditional choreography for the dances, which is regarded as virtually sacrosanct. Likewise, over time the rôle of Siegfried has become more prominent, due largely to the evolution of ballet technique.
In 1922, Finnish National Ballet was the first European company that staged a complete production of the ballet. By the time Swan Lake premiered in Helsinki in 1922, it had only ever been performed by Russian and Czech ballet groups, and only visiting Russian ballet groups had brought it to Western Europe.[22]
In 1940, the San Francisco Ballet became the first American company to stage a complete production of Swan Lake. The enormously successful production starred Lew Christensen as Prince Siegfried, Jacqueline Martin as Odette, and Janet Reed as Odile. Willam Christensen based his choreography on the Petipa–Ivanov production, turning to San Francisco's large population of Russian émigrés, headed by Princess and Prince Vasili Alexandrovich of Russia, to help him ensure that the production succeeded in its goal of preserving Russian culture in San Francisco.[23]
Several notable productions have diverged from the original and its 1895 revival:

In 1967, Erik Bruhn produced and danced in a new Swan Lake for the National Ballet of Canada, with striking largely black and white designs by Desmond Healey. Although substantial portions of the Petipa-Ivanov choreography were retained, Bruhn's alterations were musical as well as choreographic. Most controversially, he recast Von Rothbart as the malevolent Black Queen, adding psychological emphasis to the Prince's difficult relationships with women, his domineering mother included.
Illusions Like ""Swan Lake"" 1976: John Neumeier, Hamburg Ballet. Neumeier interpolated the story of Ludwig II of Bavaria into the Swan Lake plot, via Ludwig's fascination with swans. Much of the original score was used with additional Tchaikovsky material and the choreography combined the familiar Petipa/Ivanov material with new dances and scenes by Neumeier. The ballet finishes with Ludwig's death by drowning while confined to an asylum, set to the dramatic music for the act 3 conclusion. With the theme of the unhappy royal being forced into heterosexual marriage for reasons of state and also the cross reference to the personal lives of actual royalty, this work anticipated both Bourne's and Murphy's interpretation. Illusions Like ""Swan Lake""  remains in the repertoire of major German ballet companies.
Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake departed from the traditional ballet by replacing the female corps de ballet with male dancers and a plot focused on the psychological pressures of modern royalty on a prince struggling with his sexuality and a distant mother. It has been performed on extended tours in Greece, Israel, Turkey, Australia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, France, Germany, the Netherlands, the United States, and Ireland in addition to the United Kingdom, and has won over thirty international awards to date.[24]
The 2000 American Ballet Theatre version (taped for television in 2005), rather than having the curtain down as the slow introduction is played, used this music to accompany a new prologue in which the audience is shown how Rothbart first transforms Odette into a swan. This prologue is similar to Vladimir Burmeister's production of Swan Lake (firstly staged in Stanislavsky Theatre in Moscow, 1953) but has some differences. Rothbart in this production is played by two dancers; one appears as a handsome young man who is easily able to lure Odette in the new prologue, and the other dancer is covered in sinister ""monster makeup"" which reveals the magician's true self. (In the film Black Swan, Natalie Portman, as Nina, dreams this in the film's opening sequence). About half-an-hour of the complete score is omitted from this production.[citation needed]
Graeme Murphy's Swan Lake was first performed in 2002, and was loosely based on the breakdown of the marriage of Lady Diana to Prince Charles and his relationship with Camilla Parker Bowles. It combined the roles of Rothbart and Odile into that of a Baroness, and the focus of the story is a love triangle.[25]
In 2010, Black Swan, a film starring Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, contained sequences from Swan Lake.[26]
In 2010, South African choreographer and ballet dancer Dada Masilo, remade Tchaikovsky's classic.[27] Her version was a mix of classic ballet and African dance. She also made a plot twist by presenting Odile (the black swan) as a gay male swan rather than a female swan.[28][29]
A Swan Lake, choreographed by Alexander Ekman and composed by Mikael Karlsson, was created for the Norwegian National Ballet. The first act is part dance part theatre, about the original production of Swan Lake, which features two stage actors and a soprano. In the second act, the stage is filled in 5000 litres of water, and features the conflict between White Swan and Black Swan.[30][31]
Instrumentation[edit]
Swan Lake is scored for the typical late 19th-century large orchestra:

Strings: violins I and II; violas, violoncellos; double basses, harp
Woodwinds: piccolo; 2 flutes; 2 oboes; 2 clarinets in B♭, A and C; 2 bassoons
Brass: 4 French horns in F; 2 cornets in A and B♭; 2 trumpets in F, D, and E; 3 trombones (2 tenor, 1 bass); tuba
Percussion: timpani; snare drum; cymbals; bass drum; triangle; tambourine; castanets; tam-tam; glockenspiel; chimes
Roles[edit]
Princess Odette (the Swan Queen, the White Swan, the Swan Princess), a beautiful princess, who has been transformed into a white swan
Prince Siegfried, a handsome Prince who falls in love with Odette
Baron Von Rothbart, an evil sorcerer, who has enchanted Odette
Odile (the Black Swan), Rothbart's daughter
Benno von Sommerstern, the Prince's friend
The Queen, Prince Siegfried's mother
Wolfgang, his tutor
Baron von Stein
The Baroness, his wife
Freiherr von Schwarzfels
His wife
A herald
A footman
Court gentlemen and ladies, friends of the prince, heralds, guests, pages, villagers, servants, swans, cygnets
Variations to characters[edit]
By 1895, Benno von Sommerstern had become just ""Benno"", and Odette ""Queen of the Swans."" Also Baron von Stein, his wife, and Freiherr von Schwarzfels and his wife were no longer identified on the program. The sovereign or ruling Princess is often rendered ""Queen Mother.""
The character of Rothbart (sometimes spelled Rotbart) has been open to many interpretations. The reason for his curse upon Odette is unknown; several versions, including two feature films, have suggested reasons, but none is typically explained by the ballet. He is rarely portrayed in human form, except in act 3. He is usually shown as an owl-like creature. In most productions, the couple's sacrifice results in his destruction. However, there are versions in which he is triumphant. Yury Grigorovich's version, which has been danced for several decades by the Bolshoi Ballet, is noted for including both endings: Rothbart was defeated in the original 1969 version, in line with Soviet-era expectations of an upbeat conclusion,[32] but in the 2001 revision, Rothbart plays a wicked game of fate with Siegfried, which he wins at the end, causing Siegfried to lose everything. In the second American Ballet Theatre production of Swan Lake, he is portrayed by two dancers: a young, handsome one who lures Odette to her doom in the prologue, and a reptilian creature. In this version, the lovers' suicide inspires the rest of Rothbart's imprisoned swans to turn on him and overcome his spell.
Odile, Rothbart's daughter usually wears jet black (though in the 1895 production, she did not), and appears only in act 3. In most modern productions, she is portrayed as Odette's exact double (though the resemblance is because of Rothbart's magic), and therefore Siegfried cannot be blamed for believing her to be Odette. There is a suggestion that in the original production, Odette and Odile were danced by two different ballerinas. This is also the case in some avant garde productions.

Synopsis[edit]
Swan Lake is generally presented in either four acts, four scenes (primarily outside Russia and Eastern Europe) or three acts, four scenes (primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe). The biggest difference of productions all over the world is that the ending, originally tragic, is now sometimes altered to a happy ending.

Prologue[edit]
Some productions include a prologue that shows how Odette first meets Rothbart, who turns Odette into a swan.

Act 1[edit]
A magnificent park before a palace
[Scène: Allegro giusto] Prince Siegfried is celebrating his birthday with his tutor, friends, and peasants [Waltz]. The revelries are interrupted by his mother, the Queen [Scène: Allegro moderato], who is concerned about his carefree lifestyle. She tells him that he must choose a bride at the royal ball the following evening (some productions include the presentation of some possible candidates). He is upset that he cannot marry for love. His friend, Benno, and the tutor try to lift his troubled mood. As evening falls [Sujet], Benno sees a flock of swans flying overhead and suggests they go on a hunt [Finale I]. Siegfried and his friends take their crossbows and set off in pursuit of the swans.

Act 2[edit]
A lakeside clearing in a forest by the ruins of a chapel. A moonlit night.

The ""Valse des cygnes"" from act 2 of the Ivanov/Petipa edition of Swan Lake
Siegfried has become separated from his friends. He arrives at the lakeside clearing, just as a flock of swans land [Scène. Moderato]. He aims his crossbow [Scène. Allegro moderato], but freezes when one of them transforms into a beautiful maiden named Odette [Scène. Moderato]. At first, she is terrified of him. When he promises not to harm her, she explains that she and her companions are victims of a spell cast by the evil owl-like sorcerer named Rothbart. By day they are turned into swans and only at night, by the side of the enchanted lake – created from the tears of Odette's mother – do they return to human form. The spell can only be broken if one who has never loved before swears to love Odette forever. Rothbart suddenly appears [Scène. Allegro vivo]. Siegfried threatens to kill him but Odette intercedes – if he dies before the spell is broken, it can never be undone.
As Rothbart disappears, the swan maidens fill the clearing [Scène: Allegro, Moderato assai quasi andante]. Siegfried breaks his crossbow, and sets about winning Odette's trust as they fall in love. But as dawn arrives, the evil spell draws Odette and her companions back to the lake and they are turned into swans again.

Act 3[edit]
An opulent hall in the palace
Guests arrive at the palace for a costume ball. Six princesses are presented to the prince [Entrance of the Guests and Waltz], as candidates for marriage. Rothbart arrives in disguise [Scène: Allegro, Allegro giusto] with his daughter, Odile, who is transformed to look like Odette. Though the princesses try to attract Siegfried with their dances [Pas de six], he has eyes only for Odile. [Scène: Allegro, Tempo di valse, Allegro vivo] Odette appears at the castle window and attempts to warn him, but he does not see her. He then proclaims to the court that he will marry Odile before Rothbart shows him a magical vision of Odette. Grief-stricken and realizing his mistake (he vowed only to love Odette), he hurries back to the lake.

Act 4[edit]
By the lakeside

Scene from act 4; Vienna State Opera, 2004
Odette is distraught. The swan maidens try to comfort her. Siegfried returns to the lake and makes a passionate apology. She forgives him, but his betrayal cannot be undone. Rather than remain a swan forever, she chooses to die. He chooses to die with her and they leap into the lake, where they will stay together forever. This breaks Rothbart's spell over the swan maidens, causing him to lose his power over them and he dies. In an apotheosis, they, who transform back into regular maidens, watch as Siegfried and Odette ascend into the Heavens together, forever united in love.

1877 libretto synopsis[edit]
Act 1
Prince Siegfried, his friends, and a group of peasants are celebrating his coming of age. His mother arrives to inform him she wishes for him to marry soon so she may make sure he does not disgrace their family line by his marriage. She has organized a ball where he is to choose his bride from among the daughters of the nobility. After the celebration, he and his friend, Benno, spot a flock of flying swans and decide to hunt them.
Act 2
Siegfried and Benno track the swans to a lake, but they vanish. A woman wearing a crown appears and meets them. She tells them her name is Odette and she was one of the swans they were hunting. She tells them her story: her mother, a good fairy, had married a knight, but she died and he remarried. Odette's stepmother is a witch who wanted to kill her, but her grandfather saved her. He had cried so much over her mother's death, he created the lake with his tears. She and her companions live in it with him, and can transform themselves into swans whenever they wish. Her stepmother still wants to kill her and stalks her in the form of an owl, but she has a crown which protects her from harm. When she gets married, her s"

The 1895 Petipa/Ivanov/Drigo revival of Swan Lake is a famous version of the ballet Swan Lake, (ru. Лебединое Озеро), (fr. Le Lac des Cygnes). This is a ballet by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky based on an ancient German legend,  presented in either four acts, four scenes (primarily outside Russia and Eastern Europe), three acts, four scenes (primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe) or, more rarely, in two acts, four scenes. Originally choreographed by Julius Reisinger to the music of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky (opus 20), it was first presented as The Lake of the Swans by the Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre on 20 February/4 March 1877 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates) in Moscow, Russia. Although the ballet is presented in many different versions, most ballet companies today base their stagings both choreographically and musically on this revival by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, staged for the Imperial Ballet, first presented on 15 January/27 January 1895, at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia instead of the original version.


Background[edit]
[1]
In the 1880s Tchaikovsky was commissioned by Ivan Vsevolozhsky, director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, to score what would become two of his greatest works: the operas The Enchantress (1886) and The Queen of Spades (1890). In 1887 Vsevolozhsky commissioned Tchaikovsky to score music for Marius Petipa's The Sleeping Beauty, a ballet which would prove to be one of both Tchaikovsky and Petipa's greatest masterworks. The first performance on 15 January 1890 by the Imperial Ballet was a great success and soon Vsevolozhsky commissioned a second score for a ballet and an opera from the composer, The Nutcracker and Iolanta, which premiered together on a double bill on 6 December 1892.
Prior to commissioning The Sleeping Beauty, Vsevolozhsky had considered reviving one act of Swan Lake for the 1886–1887 season and had even written a letter requesting the music from Tchaikovsky's publisher Jurgenson, who recommended that the fourth scene be staged. However, Tchaikovsky suggested that the second scene be staged instead, which he considered to be "" ... the best in all respects."" Though this production never materialized, Vsevolozhsky continued showing interest in Swan Lake, and even as The Nutcracker was being readied for production in 1892 he was designing costumes for a possible revival of the work that would be produced by Petipa (Vsevolozhsky was a talented costume designer, having designed the costumes for the first productions of both The Sleeping Beauty and The Nutcracker, as well as Raymonda, among many other ballets).
Tchaikovsky was delighted at the prospect of Swan Lake being revived by Petipa, of whom he had the greatest respect, asserting that ""never with anyone but Petipa would I produce ballets."" According to the composer/conductor Riccardo Drigo, ""While (Tchaikovsky) was still alive I knew of his dissatisfaction with the instrumentation of (Swan Lake), and that he intended to take up the matter, but he never managed to do this."" Tchaikovsky died on 6 November 1893, just when plans to revive Swan Lake were beginning to come to fruition.
Even with this statement from Drigo (which is from his memoirs written some thirty years after Tchaikovsky's death), it is not known for certain if Tchaikovsky was even going to revise the music for the prospected revival of Swan Lake. At some point before his death, Tchaikovsky approved of three numbers orchestrated by Drigo from his Op. 72 (18 Pieces, for piano) for interpolation into the production (i.e. the Variation of Odile from the third scene and, for the fourth scene, the so-called Waltz for White and Black Swans and the Scène Dansante/Pas d'action). According to Tchaikovsky's brother Modeste, ""...he [Tchaikovsky] was so delighted with Maestro Drigo's score for Petipa's The Talisman that he was not opposed to the idea of having him perform some of the necessary revisions [to Swan Lake]..."". Whatever the case, as a result of Tchaikovsky's death, Drigo was forced to revise the score himself, but not before receiving approval from Modest.
Vsevolozhsky then planned a memorial concert to be given by the Imperial Ballet and Opera at the Mariinsky Theatre in honor of the composer, with the bill consisting of the first act of Tchaikovsky's opera The Maid of Orleans, his Romeo and Juliet overture, the Coronation Cantana, and the second scene of Swan Lake. The concert was given twice, on 17 and 22 February 1894, with the Swan Lake excerpt being presented in a staging by Lev Ivanov, Second Balletmaster to the Imperial Ballet. Ivanov's choreography for the memorial concert was unanimously hailed as wonderful and though the concert itself was not a success (due to high ticket prices the turnout was poor), Ivanov nevertheless won laurels for his work. The critic Bezobrazov complemented Ivanov: ""The staging of the dances in Swan Lake is the work of the Balletmaster Lev Ivanov and does him great honor. Mr. Ivanov revealed a great deal of the finest, most elegant taste. To all the dances the Balletmaster imparted a noble stamp and consistent style.""
The ballerina who danced Odette was the Italian virtuosa Pierina Legnani, considered by the critics, public, and her fellow dancers alike to be among the greatest, if not the greatest ballerina to ever grace the Imperial stage. She had made her début with the Imperial Ballet in Cinderella (choreographed by Petipa, Ivanov, and Enrico Cecchetti to the music of Baron Boris Fitinhof-Schell) in December 1893, and when she took to the stage she immediately swept all before her. In the Grand Pas d'action of the ballet's second act she demonstrated her phenomenal technique - next to her flawless placement and perfection of port de bras she performed pique turns with quadruple and quintuple pirouettes en pointe, accented with double turns no less than four times in a row - a feat even modern-day ballerinas have difficulty achieving. In the Grand Pas of the last act Legnani completely out-did herself - in her variation she completed no less than thirty-two fouettés en tournant, the first ballerina ever to perform such a feat. The dazzled public roared with demands for an encore, and the ballerina repeated her variation, this time performing twenty-eight fouettés en tournant. According to press accounts of the production the ballerina ""did not move at all from the place she started.""
Soon after Legnani was named Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the Imperial Ballet, and it was because of her great talent that the prospected revival of Swan Lake was planned for her benefit performance in the 1894–1895 season. However, the death of Tsar Alexander III on 1 November 1894 and the period of official mourning which followed it brought all ballet performances and rehearsals to a close for some time, and as a result, all efforts were able to be concentrated on the pre-production of the revival of Swan Lake. Ivanov and Petipa chose to collaborate on the production, with Ivanov retaining his dances for the second scene while choreographing the fourth, and with Petipa staging the first and third scenes. Ivanov was also entrusted with staging the Neapolitan Dance and the Hungarian Dance in the Grand Divertessment of the third scene.
Tchaikovsky's brother Modest was called upon to make the required changes to the ballet's libretto, the most prominent being his revision of the ballet's finale: instead of the lovers simply drowning at the hand of the wicked Rothbart as in the original 1877 scenario, Odette commits suicide by drowning herself, with Prince Siegfried choosing to die as well, rather than live without her, and soon the lovers' spirits are reunited in an apotheosis. Aside from the revision of the libretto the ballet was changed from four acts to three - with Act II becoming Act I-Scene 2, Act III becoming Act II, and Act IV becoming Act III.
All was ready by the beginning of 1895 and the ballet had its premiere on 15 January. Pierina Legnani danced Odette/Odile, with Pavel Gerdt as Prince Siegfried, Alexei Bulgakov as Von Rothbart, and Alexander Oblakov as Benno.

Notation of Swan Lake and the 1895 première[edit]
[2]

Pierina Legnani as 'Odette'
The 1895 Petipa/Ivanov/Drigo edition of Swan Lake was notated in the method of Stepanov Choreographic Notation in or around 1901, and completed between April 1906 and April 1907, documenting a performance of the work with the Ballerina Vera Trefilova as Odette/Odile. This choreographic notation is today housed in the Harvard University Library Theatre Collection and is part of a whole cache of notation known as the Sergeyev Collection, which documents the works of Marius Petipa that comprised the repertory of the Imperial Ballet at the turn of the 20th century. Here are descriptions of some of the scenes and dances of his and Ivanov's 1895 edition of Swan Lake.

Act I (or Act I-Scene 1)[edit]
Petipa's famous pas de trois from the first scene is still danced today by most companies nearly unchanged, as Petipa usually did when staging a pas de trois classique, having the ballerina who dances the first variation leaving the stage before the end of the Entrée (as in Petipa's Grand Pas de Trois des Odalisques from Le Corsaire, or his Pas de Trois from Paquita). The first dancers to perform the pas de trois in the 1895 revival were Olga Preobrajenskaya, Georgy Kyaksht (famous for creating the role of Harlequin in Petipa's original 1900 Harlequinade), and Varvara Rykhlyakova. According to a press account: ""...a captivating Pas de Trois, which is technically difficult, is performed en pointe for the most part with multiple turns, and was excellently performed by the Danseuses and their partner.""
The Waltz of the first scene or the Valse Champêtre (or the Valse Villageoise) is danced in many different versions by ballet companies today. Perhaps the only company to dance this Waltz today in Petipa's original version is the Royal Ballet. The notation documents Petipa's original choreography - one of his signature lavish dances for a massive corps de ballet. According to the notation the choreography called for forty dancers (20 men and 20 women), with sixteen of them using footstools painted both red and green to form geometric patterns and make various poses, with the corps de ballet at all times remaining inside the space made by the footstools. A Maypole was brought out toward the finale of the Waltz. One critic who saw the first performance described it: ""At the end of the Waltz a (Maypole) is introduced, the high point of which ribbons are dropped in sequential order: red ribbons, blue, and yellow. The dancers pick up the ends of the ribbons, forming thereby a kind of umbrella; it turned out to be quite an effective picture.""

Act II (or Act I-Scene 2)[edit]
Perhaps only the Royal Ballet's 1987 revival of Swan Lake (staged by Anthony Dowell and Roland John Wiley) retains Ivanov's original scheme for the second scene, while most other productions present a version which has been handed down primarily by way of Soviet-era revisions. In the 1895 production, Prince Siegfried made his way to the enchanted lake with a group of hunters, not by himself as in many modern versions. When he first encountered Odette, there was (as is preserved in the notation) an extensive mime sequence between the two characters, a passage which is rarely performed in modern times (American Ballet Theatre director Kevin McKenzie created a mime sequence in the same manner as the original for his recent production of Swan Lake, while the Royal Ballet still performs a rendition of Ivanov's original mime).
A most interesting feature of Ivanov's original choreography for the second scene was the use of children, a feature that was only recently restored in the Royal Ballet's 1987 production - there is perhaps no other production in the world which uses children in this scene. In Ivanov's original choreography, when Odette makes her second entrance to beg Benno and the hunting party not to hurt her fellow Swan Maidens, she is followed onstage by eight girl students as Swans. These students also participate in the Waltz of the Swans, which was far more elaborate in Ivanov's original than the traditional version danced today by most companies.
The Grand Adagio of the second scene (the Pas de Deux of Odette and Prince Siegfried sometimes referred to as the Love Duet) was choreographed by Ivanov as a Pas de deux à Trois - Pierina Legnani was partnered by both Pavel Gerdt (who danced Prince Siegfried) and Alexander Oblakov (who danced Benno). It was not until the Danseur Nikolai Legat replaced Gerdt in the role of Prince Siegfried in the late 1890s that the pas became a pas de deux. Following Legat's example, many of the danseurs of the Imperial Ballet who performed Prince Siegfried after he chose to partner Odette alone. In spite of this, the notation for Swan Lake, made between April 1906 and April 1907, documents Ivanov's original 1895 scheme. The first production outside of Russia of the full-length Petipa/Ivanov production of Swan Lake was staged by Nicholas Sergeyev for the Vic-Wells Ballet (today the Royal Ballet) in 1934, a production which retained Ivanov's original version of the Grand Adagio as a Pas de deux à Trois, but over time the company chose to dance it as a pas de deux, which is today the tradition. One critic who viewed the 1895 premiere wrote of this pas: ""Legnani was as if transformed, preening and admiring her snow-white down, it was as if Legnani were actually experiencing these moments, filled with poetic melancholy. Langour showed in each of her graceful movements. There Legnani was at the height of understanding her art.""
The famous Dance of the Little Swans is the only number of the original 1895 Swan Lake to be danced in modern times exactly as Ivanov choreographed it. The remainder of the second scene is notated but the finale is not.

Act III (or Act II)[edit]
The National dances are rarely if ever, performed as Petipa and Ivanov first staged them (Petipa staged the Spanish Dance and the Mazurka, Ivanov staged the Neapolitan Dance and the Hungarian Dance). During the premiere of the 1895 revival the Spanish Dance and the Neapolitan Dance left a rather neutral impression, but the Hungarian Dance and Mazurka were both encored. The Hungarian Dance was performed by the Danseur Alfred Bekefi and Petipa's daughter Marie Petipa (famous for creating the role of the Lilac Fairy in The Sleeping Beauty), who wore 12,000 roubles worth of diamonds for the performance. Perhaps the biggest sensation was the Mazurka, danced by a group of dancers with Felix Kschessinsky as soloist. Kschessinsky (the father of the Ballerina Mathilde Kschessinskaya) was hailed in his day at the Mariinsky Theatre as ""King of the Mazurka."" The national dances are all preserved in Petipa and Ivanov's original choreography with the exception of the Spanish Dance, which is only preserved in Alexander Gorsky's 1913 version.
The character of Odile was not a ""Black Swan"" at all in either the original production of 1877 nor in the revival of 1895, and she was not performed as such for many years - she was simply  Rothbart's evil daughter until sometime in the late 1930s or early 1940s. As Odile, Pierina Legnani appeared in a glittering multi-colored costume with no feathers to be found - obviously to appear more as an enchantress than as a ""Black Swan."" Later performances at the Mariinsky Theatre of Swan Lake used similar costume designs for Odile throughout the late 19th century and early 20th century. It is unknown when the tradition of having Odile performed as a ""Black Swan"" began, but most historians point to a 1941 staging of the third scene (the ""Ballroom Scene"") performed by the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. This production was staged by Alexandra Fedorova-Fokine under the title The Magic Swan. Odile was danced by the great Ballerina Tamara Toumanova. At the time the only part of Swan Lake that was known in the west was the famous second scene (or the ""White Act"" as it is sometimes called). In an effort to have the audience distinguish Odile from the more well-known Odette, Fedorova-Fokine had Toumanova perform in a black costume, and almost by accident Odile began to be referred to as ""The Black Swan."" Though Toumanova was not the first ballerina to wear such a costume when dancing Odile, her 1941 performance set the tradition in motion and soon Odile became ""The Black Swan,"" a tradition that quickly spread everywhere, including Russia.
What became known in modern times as The Black Swan Pas de Deux, which ends with glittering virtuosity from the ballerina as well as the danseur, was originally staged by Petipa as a Grand Pas de Deux à Quatre demi d'action - Prince Siegfried (Pavel Gerdt) and an additional suitor (danced by Alexander Gorsky) partnered Odile (Pierina Legnani), while Rothbart (danced by Alexei Bulgakov) did most of the acting/mime. In order to share in the ""labour"" of partnering, it was a tradition in the late 19th century Imperial Theatres to have an additional suitor, along with the lead cavalier, partner the Prima Ballerina in a ballet's Grand Adagio. This was mostly because the aging Pavel Gerdt (who was fifty years old in 1895) was performing nearly all of the lead male roles in the repertory.
After the Grand Adagio Pavel Gerdt did not dance a variation, but the additional cavalier, danced by Alexander Gorsky, did - though a rather short one according to contemporary accounts. Just as it was a tradition in the Imperial Ballet that an additional suitor partner the Ballerina, it was also tradition that this additional suitor dance the lead male character's variation, being that the aging Pavel Gerdt could not. It is not known for certain what music was used for Gorsky's variation, though it is thought to have been either a version of what later became the traditional Variation of Prince Siegfried, or an interpolation from another work, though this is highly unlikely. Gorsky would later expand on this solo for his own staging of the Petipa/Ivanov Swan Lake at the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre in 1901, for which he danced the lead. Prince Siegfried's famous variation has been historically credited to the great Danseur of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet Vakhtang Chabukiani, who it has been said was the first to dance the solo in the 1930s at the Kirov, though most likely he had learned the variation from Gorsky. Today the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's score for Swan Lake has this variation titled with a rubric that says Variation of Chabukiani, and this same solo is used by nearly every company when they perform The Black Swan Pas de Deux, though there are often differences in the music regarding orchestration from production to production (for example, the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's version of this music is orchestrated for solo clarinet at the start, whereas in the west it is usually the full violin section that plays throughout).

Pavel Gerdt as Prince Siegfried in the Petipa/Ivanov revival ofSwan Lake, St. Petersburg, 1895
Pierina Legnani's variation as Odile was crafted by Petipa for her virtuoso technique and is for the most part still performed as originally choreographed by him, still challenging ballerinas to the present day. The Coda which followed Odile's variation was, as is well known, one the sensations of the 1895 premiere, with Legnani performing her famous thirty-two fouettés en tournant. The tradition of the famous 32 fouettés en tournant has spilled over into other famous 19th century Grand Pas, among them, the Le Corsaire Pas de Deux, Don Quxiote Grand Pas de Deux, and the Paquita Grand Pas Classique, among others.

Act IV (or Act III)[edit]
At the beginning of the fourth scene, after a brief interlude, the second of the additions to the ballet was danced - another Waltz of the Swans to Drigo's orchestration of a piece from Tchaikovsky's Op. 72 - No. 11 Valse Bluette. This Waltz is still retained by many companies, particularly the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet and the Royal Ballet. Ivanov choreographed this Waltz, based on Petipa's sketches, for both white and black Swans. After the Waltz is over Odette made her frantic entrance and, (as preserved in the notation), a brief mime interlude followed between her and a few of her Swan maidens.
After Prince Siegfried made his entrance, the third of the additions to the ballet was a Pas d'action for his reconciliation with Odette. This number was also orchestrated by Drigo from Tchaikovsky's Op. 72 - No. 15 Un poco di Chopin, a piece which is not danced by very many companies today, except for the Royal Ballet and the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet. After Rothbart makes his entrance a brief interlude ensues, but soon the choreographic notation comes to an end.
The premiere of the Petipa/Ivanov/Drigo was quite a success, with Legnani enchanting the audience with her versatile portrayal of the Swan Queen Odette and the evil enchantress Odile, but the 1895 version was still not the colossal triumph that has been accepted as fact in modern times. Most of the reviews in the St. Petersburg newspapers were positive.

The Tableau of Swan Lake in the second scene was planned with great talent and permeated with true poetry, gloomy and expressive. Among the craggy rocks in the far distance, a mysterious and deathly quiet lake is seen. The entire stage is filled with soft, quivering moonlight ... To melodious sounds, lightly and beautifully, like the music, a flock of swans, floats out...the 'Waltz of the Swans' is simple and beautiful. The Adagio is the Ballerina's masterpiece, in the performance of which Miss Legnani revealed brilliant technique, lightness of movement, and plasticity of the pose.
Unlike the premiere of The Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake did not dominate the repertory of the Mariinsky Theatre in its first season. It was given only sixteen performances in the 1895–1896 season and was not performed at all in 1897. Even more surprising, the ballet was only given four times in 1898 and 1899. The ballet belonged solely to Legnani until she left St. Petersburg for her native Italy in 1901. After her departure, the ballet was taken over by Mathilde Kschessinskaya, who was as much celebrated in the role as was her Italian predecessor.

Drigo's edition of Tchaikovsky's score[edit]
There are major differences in the score of Swan Lake when one compares a recording or manuscript of the original, un-altered composition of 1877, with the score as performed in live performance. Although he is rarely credited for his work, it is Riccardo Drigo's revision of Tchaikovsky's score as done for Petipa and Ivanov's 1895 revival that almost every ballet company utilizes to one degree or another when performing Swan Lake. Most ballet companies opt to fashion their own respective version of Tchaikovsky's score. Nevertheless, Drigo's revision of the score is often used as the foundation. It is significant to note that Tchaikovsky's brother Modest approved of Drigo revising the music, and Tchaikovsky himself approved of the additions.

Structure[edit]
Below is a list of the most striking changes made by Drigo to the score of Swan Lake, many of which have remained the standard of ballet companies today.
NOTE Some numbering of the Acts and Scenes were changed for the 1895 revival - Act II became Act I-scene 2, thus changing Act III to Act II, and Act IV to Act III.
Act I (or Act I-Scene 1)

the Andante sostenuto (No. 4-2 in the original score) of the Pas de Trois (No. 4) was deleted.
the first variation of the Pas de Trois (No. 4-3 in the original score) was changed from Allegro semplice to Allegro moderato. The eight bars of music preceding the final eight bars of the variation were deleted. Two bars of music before the final two bars were deleted as well. Percussion (including fortissimo cymbals, snare drum, and triangle) was removed from the final bars.
the second variation of the Pas de Trois (No. 4-4) was shortened (repeated passages removed). As well, the final eight bars of music was changed from poco meno to meno.
the third variation of the Pas de Trois (No. 4-5) was also shortened (repeated passages removed), and changed from Allegro to Allegretto.
the  Waltz (No. 2) and the Pas de Trois (No. 4) were reversed. The Waltz was retitled Valse Champêtre (Pastoral Waltz). It is also known as the Valse Villageoise. Various repeated passages were removed from the waltz.
the Pas de Deux for Two Merry Makers (No. 5) was transferred to Act III (known today as the  Black Swan Pas de deux) and extensively revised.
Act II (or Act I-Scene 2)

the dances of the Grand Pas des Cygnes (or the Dances of the Swans) were put into a new order, with Tchaikovsky's reprise of the Waltz of the Swans (Tempo di valse-No. 13-3) being deleted. The new order was - the Waltz of the Swans (Tempo di valse-No. 13-1), the Grand Adagio AKA the Love Duet (Pas d'action-No. 13-5), the Dance of the Little Swans (Allegro moderato-No. 13-4), the General Dance (Tempo di valse-No. 13-6), Variation of Odette (Moderato assai-Molto più mosso No. 13-2), and the Grand Coda (Coda-Allegro vivo No. 13-7). This order of the dances is retained by almost every ballet company today.
the ending of the Grand Adagio or Love Duet (Pas d'action-No. 13-5) was modified by Drigo. Originally this number ended with an Allegro movement in Eb major. This ending was omitted and in its place, Drigo added an epilogue at bar 95 which was composed by himself. The new ending corresponded with the motif of the rest of the number, while also reverting to the opening key. This is the version that is used by nearly every ballet company today.
the Coda (No. 13-7) (retitled Coda Générale) was lengthened by having the number repeat before the finale.
Act III (or Act II)

the Ballabile: Dances for the Corps de ballet and the Dwarfs (No. 16) was deleted (this music was later used by the Balletmaster Konstantin Sergeyev in his 1951 version for the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet as a dance for a Court Jester).
the Valse des fiancées (Scène: La sortie des invités et la valse, No. 17) was edited so that, instead of a separate entrance for each prospective bride and her family, one single entrance would suffice.
the Grand Pas de Six (no.19) was deleted (many choreographers have re-worked this number in various stagings, most notably Kenneth MacMillan for his production for the Royal Ballet).
the Russian Dance Tchaikovsky composed for Pelagia Karpakova (catalogued as appendix no. 2 in the original score) was deleted (this number is often used in various modern stagings of the ballet, and has even been used as an Arabian Dance, as in the Pacific Northwest Ballet's production staged by Kent Stowell).
the Pas de Deux that was composed by Ludwig Minkus for the Ballerina Anna Sobeshchanskaya, which was partially re-orchestrated/adapted by Tchaikovsky (catalogued as appendix no. 1 in the original score), was deleted (today this Pas is known as the Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux in George Balanchine's celebrated version).
the Grand Pas de Deux (aka The Black Swan Pas de Deux) was fashioned from the music of the Pas de Deux for Two Merry Makers (No. 5 in the original score). The Adagio (Andante, No. 5-2) was modified by Drigo - this number originally ended with an Allegro movement in A major for solo violin, which was cut. As he had done with the Grand Adagio of the second scene, Drigo composed a new ending for the Adagio, inserted at bar 75 (this version of the Adagio of The Black Swan Pas de Deux is still used by nearly every ballet company today).
the traditional variation for Prince Siegfried was first performed by Vakhtang Chabukiani when he performed the role at the Kirov Theatre in 1932. The music was fashioned from the omitted allegro ending for solo violin of No. 5-2. The Marinsky Theatre's orchestral score titles this variation as ""Variation Chabukiani"". Eventually, this variation came to be used in nearly all productions of Swan Lake around the world.
the Tempo di valse (No. 5-3) was retained as a male variation in 1895. In Tchaikovsky's original score, this piece led into the proceeding coda (No. 5-4). In light of this, the final 2 bars were deleted and a new bar of music was added to conclude the piece. Since the danseur Pavel Gerdt was over fifty years of age at the time of the premiere of the 1895 revival, this variation was performed by Alexander Gorsky.
the now familiar Variation of Odile of The Black Swan Pas de Deux was orchestrated by Drigo from Tchaikovsky's Opus 72 for Piano - No. 12 L'Espiègle, which is still danced today by nearly every Ballerina as Odile.
in the Finale (Scène, No. 24), the reprise of the waltz from No. 17 (Scène: La sortie des invités et la valse) was omitted.
Act IV (or Act III)

The Entr'acte (No. 25) was edited and further modified so that the music could move to a new key and lead into the following number.
The Scène (No. 26) and the Dance of the Little Swans (No. 27) were deleted. Here the second addition was inserted - another piece from Tchaikovsky's Opus 72 for Piano - No. 11 Valse Bluette, which was used as a Waltz for White and Black Swans (this number is not performed by many companies, but is still retained by the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet and the Royal Ballet).
At bar 26 of No. 28 the third addition from Tchaikovsky's Opus 72 for Piano was  inserted - No. 15 Un poco di Chopin, orchestrated by Drigo as a Pas d'action for Prince Siegfried and Odette in which the lovers reconcile. After this number, the music continued at bar 27 of No. 28. The so-called ""storm music"" was deleted, and the music resumed. The final passage of music which contained tremendous dynamics from the brass section was softened.
Drigo's edition of the score[edit]
NOTE - the numbers of each of the dances/scenes correspond with Tchaikovsky's original score. The titles of each of the dances/scenes come from the published libretto and the program of the premiere of the 1895 revival, most differing from the titles of the original score. Although this list indicates the most prominent changes to each individual dance/scene, it does not list such changes as deletions of bars of music, etc.

Ballet choreographed by Matthew Bourne


Matthew Bourne's Swan LakeChoreographerMatthew BourneMusicTchaikovskyPremiere9 November 1995 (1995-11-09) Original ballet companyNew AdventuresWebsitenew-adventures.net/swan-lake
Matthew Bourne's Swan Lake is a contemporary ballet based on the Russian romantic work Swan Lake, from which it takes the music by Tchaikovsky and the broad outline of the plot. Bourne's rendering is best known for having the traditionally female parts of the swans danced by men.
It was the longest-running ballet in London's West End and on Broadway. First staged at Sadler's Wells theatre in London in 1995, it has been performed in the UK, Los Angeles, Europe, Russia, Australia, South Korea, Japan, Israel, China, and Singapore.[1]


Synopsis[edit]
This synopsis is derived from programme notes and the synopsis provided on the DVD.[2] The plot of the ballet revolves around a young crown prince, his distant mother, and his desire for freedom, represented by a swan.

Act I[edit]
In the prologue, the Prince, as a child, is awakened by a nightmare of a swan. The Prince's mother comes in to comfort him, but becoming nervous by the situation's intimacy, leaves.
Scene 1 opens with the Prince being prepared for a day of official duties by chambermaids and valets.
In Scene 2, arrayed in his full dress uniform, the Prince becomes bored by a boat christening, a ribbon cutting, and other official tasks. His mother prods him to keep up appearances, even as she devotes more attention to the soldiers than she does to him. During this scene, there is a transition from the child actor playing the young Prince to the identically-dressed adult dancer who portrays the grown Prince. This now-adult Prince is introduced to a girl called ""the Girlfriend"". Although the girl seems foisted on him by von Rothbart, the Private Secretary,[a] the Prince prefers her to his duty-bound life.
In Scene 3, the Queen, one of her admiring soldiers, the Private Secretary, the Prince, and the Girlfriend all appear in a theatre box, where they watch a ballet that is staged for the actual audience as well as for the characters. The ballet's backdrop (from a design for Castle Falkenstein by Christian Jank), ornate costumes, and acting parody the romantic ballets of which the original Swan Lake was an example. The Girlfriend's responses to the dance as well as her eventual dropping her purse from the royal box annoy the Queen and von Rothbart.
Scene 4 finds the Prince drinking in his private chambers in front of a mirror, to his mother's shock. A nearly violent pas de deux ensues in which he pleads for her attention and love, while she rebukes him.
The Prince then goes into the streets and into the Swank Bar, a 1970s-style disco, in Scenes Five and Six. Here is where the choreography veers from classical ballet, with jazz forms and modern dance dominating. The Prince gets into a fight with sailors at the bar, and he is thrown out into the street. In Scene Seven, he sees the Girlfriend being paid off by von Rothbart, and he is totally shattered to discover that the only person who appeared to love him is a fake. This increases his desperation and he vows to kill himself.
While sitting in the street at the end of Scene Seven the Prince imagines a group of swans flying towards him but the vision disappears. It is the first flash of the Prince's descent into mental turmoil.

Act II[edit]
Distraught and disappointed that he will never find affection, the Prince writes a suicide note and goes to throw himself into a lake at a public park inhabited by swans. He is saved by a vision in which he encounters the lead Swan, who had appeared to him in his dreams. Initially rejected by the lead Swan, the Prince is gradually accepted and taken into the Swan's arms. The Prince is elated and abandons his plan to kill himself. This Act contains the most talked-about element of the ballet in which bare-chested, barefoot male dancers play the swans, and it contains a very sensual pas de deux between the lead Swan and the Prince.

Act III[edit]
Scene 1 begins with princesses from various European nations and their escorts arriving at the palace gates for a grand ball. The Girlfriend sneaks in amongst them.
Scene 2 takes place in a ballroom. It commences with the arrival of the Queen and the Prince and some formal dancing, but quickly degenerates into a debauched party of drinking and lascivious come-ons. Into this arrives the charismatic and sexually aggressive son of von Rothbart,[b] the Private Secretary, in black leather trousers, who intensifies the sexual tension even further by flirting with every woman present, including the Queen. Each woman finds herself drawn to him and actively participates in the mutual, sometimes lewd, flirtation.
Just as in the original Swan Lake, where customarily (although not always) one ballerina performs the roles of both the white swan (Odette) and the black swan (Odile), the same ballet dancer performs the white Swan and the black-clad young von Rothbart in this version. The Prince sees something of his beloved Swan in the son, and he is very attracted to his bravado and animal magnetism but shocked by his lewdness, especially towards his mother. During bump and grind group numbers and a sequence of national dances, it becomes clear that the Queen is powerfully attracted to von Rothbart's son. His father, the Private Secretary, looks on with an increasingly triumphant approval. The Prince also tries to approach young von Rothbart, only to be rebuffed. The Prince retreats into his mind and imagines dancing intimately with him, but the Prince's confusion interrupts the fantasy, and the son's movements turn from love to violence.
The Prince imagines the Queen and young von Rothbart flaunting their growing physical affection for each other. They join with the other guests at the ball to laugh and ridicule him because of his growing distress. The Queen and young von Rothbart end their dancing with an embrace and passionate kissing. The Prince, in his fury, violently separates them and is rewarded by outrage from both and a slap from his mother. Overwhelmed by conflicted feelings, the Prince produces a pistol and threatens to shoot his mother. In an ensuing scuffle the Girlfriend tries to dissuade the Prince, while the Private Secretary draws a pistol and points it at the Prince. As shots ring out, the Girlfriend and the Prince fall to the ground, but only the Girlfriend has been hit. She lies unconscious and the Prince is dragged away, while the Queen throws herself into young von Rothbart's arms. He gives the pistol he had taken from the Prince to his father, the two of them laughing.
The plot has evolved over the years since the debut. The most conspicuous change Bourne made was to remove the subplot of the von Rothbart conspiracy to put his son on the throne. The Private Secretary now becomes just a functionary (no longer a von Rothbart counterpart, nor villain) and the Stranger is no longer shown conspiring with him. The identity of the Stranger becomes even more vague and Bourne prefers to leave him and his relationship with the Prince up to the individual interpretation of the viewer.

Act IV[edit]
In the final act, the Prince, regarded as having lost his mind, is confined to an asylum in a room with a high barred window, and is treated by a doctor and a team of nurses wearing masks that resemble the Queen's face, in a scene reminiscent of his dressing at the beginning of the ballet. The Queen visits but, again, she is still unable to fully express love for her son.
The Prince crawls into bed and appears to sleep. However, he begins writhing as he dreams of the troupe of swans emerging from under and behind, dancing around him. He wakes from his nightmare, checking under his bed and around his room for swans. His tortured expression and jerky movements convey the Prince in turmoil. His lead Swan then slowly emerges from within the Prince's bed. The Swan dances with the Prince and assures him of his continued affection. But, the rest of the swans turn on the lead Swan when he makes it clear that he values his relationship with the Prince more than he does them. They separate the two and begin attacking the Prince before the Swan leaps in to save him. The Swan embraces the Prince and envelops him in his wings. The swans' fury increases and their next attack dismembers the Swan, who then disappears. Heartbroken and despondent, the Prince wails in agony and collapses onto the bed. The Queen then finds her dead son's body and breaks down in tears. However, in death the Prince and the Swan are reunited, as shown by a tableau depicting the lead Swan tenderly holding the young Prince in his arms.

Imagery and innovation[edit]
The original Swan Lake was based on the story of Ondine, a German myth with a theme common in Romanticism that was adapted by Hans Christian Andersen for his story The Little Mermaid. Ondine was a beautiful and immortal water nymph. The only threat to her eternal happiness was if she fell in love with a mortal and bore his child, as she would then lose her immortality. Ondine duly fell in love with a dashing knight, Sir Lawrence, and they were married, the knight pledging unfailing love and faithfulness to her with his every waking breath. A year after their wedding Ondine bore Lawrence a son. From that moment she began to age. As Ondine's beauty faded, Lawrence lost interest in her.
One afternoon Ondine was walking near some stables when she heard the familiar snoring of her husband. When she entered the stable, she saw Sir Lawrence lying in the arms of another woman. Kicking her husband awake, she cursed him such that he would have breath so long as he remained awake, but if he ever fell asleep his breath would be taken from him and he would die.
According to Alastair Macaulay (formerly chief dance critic of The New York Times, The Times Literary Supplement and chief theatre critic of the Financial Times), the Ondine myth is said to be an image of psycho-sexual distress: the nymph is a forlorn image of repressed virginity, anxious that she will never achieve womanly fulfillment, while her feminine nemesis that leads her husband astray represents the confident seductive power that threatens her hopes. The story is double-edged: the human protagonist, in loving the nymph, transgresses against his own kind and may be punished. If, having betrayed her once, he returns to her, her kiss will bring him death; in fact, it may be this love-in-death that the man desires most.[3]
Bourne's Swan Lake radically reinterprets the myth. The focus of the ballet is turned away from the Ondine character to the man – the Prince. It is the Prince who struggles against repression and hopes for liberty, and who needs love to make him safe.[3] In addition, it is not the mortal who is unfaithful to the nymph. Rather, it is the Swan who (in Act Two) expresses love for the Prince, betrays him in the form of the Stranger (Act Three), and finally returns to him (Act Four). However, as in the Ondine myth, the sin of betrayal cannot be expiated except in death.

Politics[edit]
Much has been made of Bourne's decision to cast men as the swans. The original ballet is a standard in the European tradition of romanticized female–male love. The heroine, the swan princess Odette, is portrayed as powerless but lovely in accordance with conventional gender roles, and her hero is portrayed as a hunter who alone has the power to save her. Having a man in the role of lead Swan suggests that the Prince's struggle has repressed gay love at its core, and changes the realm of the plot from magical to psychological. The fierce, bird-like choreography given to the swan corps re-interprets the archetype of the swan as a pretty, feminine bird of gentle grace. According to Bourne, ""The idea of a male swan makes complete sense to me. The strength, the beauty, the enormous wingspan of these creatures suggests to the musculature of a male dancer more readily than a ballerina in her white tutu.""[1]
However, the same central themes carry through both works. Both are about doomed, forbidden love, and both feature a Prince who wishes to transcend the boundaries of everyday convention through that love. Both themes have strong ties to the life of Tchaikovsky, the ballet's composer, whose homosexuality caused a number of complications in his life.

The score[edit]
In order to accommodate his revised scenario, Bourne somewhat altered Tchaikovsky's score, reordering several numbers and omitting others. For example, No. 5 has been moved in its entirety from Act One to Act Three, where it follows the (reordered) national dances. Act Three has been trimmed by leaving out most of No. 19 and all of the following pas de deux.[2]

The ballet Sweeney Todd, Op. 68 by Malcolm Arnold was completed in 1959. It is a one-act ballet based on the legend of Sweeney Todd, a villain in The String of Pearls serial. The scenario and original choreography were by John Cranko and the scenery and costumes by Alix Stone in the style of Victorian toy theatres.[1] It was first performed by the Royal Ballet touring company on 10 December 1959, at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon, with the Royal Opera House Orchestra conducted by John Lanchbery. The dancers who created the roles in the first production were Donald Britton (Sweeney Todd), Johaar Mosaval (Tobias), Elizabeth Anderton (Johanna), Desmond Doyle (Mark Ingestre), Ian Hamilton (Colonel Jeffrey).[2]

Concert suites[edit]
In 1984, the composer David Ellis compiled a 20-minute concert suite, Op. 68a from the ballet in collaboration with the composer.[3] The suite was first performed on 19 June 1990 at Bristol University with the University Chamber Orchestra. A shortened version of the suite was arranged for brass band by Phillip Littlemore. It had its first performance on  22 October 2006 at the Malcolm Arnold Festival, Derngate in Northampton by the Rushden Windmill Band led by Richard Graves.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet dance
This article is about the Taglioni and Bournonville ballets. For Mikhail Fokine's ballet, see Les Sylphides.
La Sylphide (English: The Sylph; Danish: Sylfiden) is a romantic ballet in two acts. There were two versions of the ballet; the original choreographed by Filippo Taglioni in 1832, and a second version choreographed by August Bournonville in 1836. Bournonville's is the only version known to have survived and is one of the world's oldest surviving ballets.

On 12 March 1832 the first version of La Sylphide premiered at the Salle Le Peletier of the Paris Opéra with choreography by the groundbreaking Italian choreographer Filippo Taglioni and music by Jean-Madeleine Schneitzhoeffer.[1]
Taglioni designed the work as a showcase for his daughter Marie. La Sylphide was the first ballet where dancing en pointe had an aesthetic rationale and was not merely an acrobatic stunt, often involving ungraceful arm movements and exertions, as had been the approach of dancers in the late 1820s. Marie was known for shortening her skirts in the performance of La Sylphide (to show off her excellent pointe work), which was considered highly scandalous at the time.[citation needed]
The ballet's libretto was written by tenor Adolphe Nourrit, the first ""Robert"" in Meyerbeer's Robert Le Diable, an opera which featured  Marie Taglioni in its dance section, Ballet of the Nuns. Nourrit's scenario was loosely based on a story by Charles Nodier, Trilby, ou Le Lutin d'Argail, but swapped the genders of the protagonists — a goblin and a fisherman's  wife of Nodier; a sylph and a farmer in the ballet.
The scene of Old Madge's witchcraft which opens Act II of the ballet was inspired by Niccolò Paganini's Le Streghe, which in its turn was inspired by a scene of witches from Il Noce di Benevento (The Walnut Tree of Benevento), an 1812 ballet by choreographer Salvatore Viganò and composer Franz Xaver Süssmayr.[2]

Emma Livry in the title role of the Taglioni/Schneitzhoeffer La Sylphide. Paris, 1862
Revivals[edit]
Emma Livry, one of the last ballerinas of the Romantic ballet era, made her debut with the Paris Opera Ballet as the sylph in an 1858 production of La Sylphide. When Marie Taglioni (who had retired in 1847) saw Livry in the role, she stayed on in Paris to teach the girl, who reminded her of herself as a young woman.
In 1892, Marius Petipa mounted a revival of Taglioni's original La Sylphide for the Imperial Ballet, with additional music by Riccardo Drigo. A variation Drigo composed for the ballerina Varvara Nikitina in Petipa's version is today the traditional solo danced by the lead ballerina of the famous Paquita Grand Pas Classique.
In 1972, a new version of La Sylphide, based on the Taglioni version, was choreographed and staged by Pierre Lacotte for the Paris Opera Ballet. Since Taglioni's choreography has been irretrievably lost, Lacotte's choreography is based on prints, notes, drawings, and archival materials from the era of the ballet's premiere. Lacotte's choreography is in the style of the period, but entirely new and has been criticised by some[who?] as inauthentic. Interpreters of the role of Lacotte's version at the Opera National de Paris include Ghislaine Thesmar (Lacotte's wife) and Aurelie Dupont. Both artists have recorded their work on DVD and video.

August Bournonville in 1841.[3]
The Danish ballet master August Bournonville had intended to present a revival of Taglioni's original version in Copenhagen with the Royal Danish Ballet, but the Paris Opera demanded too high a price for Schneitzhoeffer's score. In the end, Bournonville mounted his own production of La Sylphide based on the original libretto, with music by Herman Severin Løvenskiold. The premiere took place on 28 November 1836,[4] with the prodigy Lucile Grahn and Bournonville in the principal roles.
The Bournonville version has been danced in its original form by the Royal Danish Ballet ever since its creation and remains one of Bournonville's most celebrated works. Modern interpreters of Bournonville's version include Eva Evdokimova and Lis Jeppesen, whose performance is recorded on DVD.

Synopsis[edit]
Act 1[edit]
In the hall of a Scottish farmhouse, James Ruben, a young Scotsman, sleeps in a chair by the fireside. A sylph gazes lovingly upon him and dances about his chair. She kisses him and then vanishes when he suddenly wakes. James rouses his friend Gurn from sleep, and questions him about the sylph. Gurn denies having seen such a creature and reminds James that he is shortly to be married. James dismisses the incident and promises to forget it.
James' bride-to-be, Effie, arrives with her mother and bridesmaids. James dutifully kisses her, but is startled by a shadow in the corner. Thinking his sylph has returned, he rushes over, only to find the witch, Old Madge, kneeling at the hearth to warm herself. James is furious with disappointment.
Effie and her friends beg Old Madge to tell their fortunes, and the witch complies. She gleefully informs Effie that James loves someone else and she will be united with Gurn. James is furious. He forces Madge from the hearth and throws her out of the house. Effie is delighted that James would tangle with a witch for her sake.
Effie and her bridesmaids hurry upstairs to prepare for the wedding, and James is left alone in the room.  As he stares out the window, the sylph materializes before him and confesses her love. She weeps at his apparent indifference. James resists at first, but, captivated by her ethereal beauty, capitulates and kisses her tenderly. Gurn, who spies the moment from the shadows, scampers off to tell Effie what has happened.
When the distressed Effie and her friends enter after hearing Gurn's report, the sylph disappears. The guests assume Gurn is simply jealous and laugh at him. Everyone dances. The sylph enters during the midst of the revelry and attempts to distract James.
As the bridal procession forms, James stands apart and gazes upon the ring he is to place on Effie's finger. The Sylph snatches the ring, places it on her own finger, and, smiling enticingly, rushes into the forest. James hurries after her in ardent pursuit. The guests are bewildered with James' sudden departure. Effie is heartbroken. She falls into her mother's arms sobbing inconsolably.

Act 2[edit]
In a fog-shrouded part of the forest, Madge and her companion witches dance grotesquely about a cauldron. The revellers add all sorts of filthy ingredients to the brew. When the contents glow, Madge reaches into the cauldron and pulls a diaphanous, magic scarf from its depths. The cauldron then sinks, the witches scatter, the fog lifts, and a lovely glade is revealed.
James enters with the sylph, who shows him her charming woodland realm. She brings him berries and water for refreshment but avoids his embrace. To cheer him, she summons her ethereal sisters who shyly enter and perform their airy dances. The young Scotsman is delighted and joins the divertissement before all flee for another part of the forest.
Meanwhile, the wedding guests have been searching the woodland for James. They enter the glade. Gurn finds his hat, but Madge convinces him to say nothing. Effie enters, weary with wandering about the forest. Madge urges Gurn to propose. He does and Effie accepts his proposal.
When they all have left, James enters the glade. Madge meets him, and tosses him the magic scarf. She tells the young farmer the scarf will bind the sylph to him so she cannot fly away. She instructs him to wind the scarf about the sylph's shoulders and arms for full effect. James is ecstatic. When the sylph returns and sees the scarf, she allows James to place it around her trembling form.
As James embraces the sylph passionately, her wings fall off, she shudders, and dies in James' arms. Sorrowfully, her sisters enter and lift her lifeless form. Suddenly, a joyful wedding procession led by Effie and Gurn crosses the glade. James is stunned. James directs his gaze heavenward; he sees the sylph borne aloft by her sisters. James collapses. Madge exults over his lifeless body. She has triumphed.

Other versions[edit]
John Barnett's 1834 opera The Mountain Sylph is based on the storyline of La Sylphide; this opera's plot was in turn satirized by W. S. Gilbert in the 1882 Savoy opera, Iolanthe.[5]
La Sylphide is often confused with the 1909 ballet Les Sylphides, another ballet involving a mythical sylph. The latter was choreographed by Michel Fokine for the Ballets Russes, using music by Frédéric Chopin, as a short performance.  Though inspired by La Sylphide, it was meant to be performed as an independent ballet with its own merits.
Matthew Bourne created an updated version of La Sylphide in his 1994 production, Highland Fling.[6] This is set in contemporary Scotland (of the 1990s) and uses the original score by Herman Severin Løvenskiold.[7]
Johan Kobborg's version of Bournonville's ballet with some interpolations of new choreography (a duet for James and Effy, a pas de six before the reel, and a duet for James and the sylph) premiered in October 2005 at the Royal Opera House.[8] [9]

Ballet by Alexander Glazunov
This article is about Fokine's 1909 ballet. For August Bournonville's 1836 ballet, see La Sylphide.

Les Sylphides (French: [le silfid]) is a short, non-narrative ballet blanc to piano music by Frédéric Chopin,  selected and orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov. 
The ballet, described as a ""romantic reverie"",[1][2] is frequently cited as the first ballet to be simply about mood and dance.[1] Les Sylphides has no plot but instead consists of several white-clad sylphs dancing in the moonlight with the ""poet"" or ""young man"" dressed in white tights and a black tunic.
Its original choreography was by Michel Fokine, with Chopin's music orchestrated by Alexander Glazunov. Glazunov had already set some of the music in 1892 as a purely orchestral suite, under the title Chopiniana, Op. 46.[3] In that form, it was introduced to the public in December 1893, conducted by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov.


Performance history[edit]
Scene from a performance in Baku, 2014
Identifying the premiere of the fuller ballet poses a challenge. One might say that it premiered in 1907 at the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg as Rêverie Romantique: Ballet sur la musique de Chopin. However, this also formed the basis of a ballet, Chopiniana, which took different forms, even in Fokine's hands.[4] As Les Sylphides, what we consider the work was premiered by Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes on 2 June 1909 at Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris. The Diaghilev premiere is the most famous, as its soloists were Tamara Karsavina, Vaslav Nijinsky (as the poet, dreamer, or young man), Anna Pavlova, and Alexandra Baldina.[5] The long white tutu that Pavlova originally danced in, and that the entire female corps de ballet adopted soon after, was designed by Léon Bakst and inspired by a lithograph of Marie Taglioni dressed as a sylph.
The London premiere, in the first season of the Diaghilev Ballets Russes, was at the Royal Opera House. With more sylph-like elusiveness, the North American premiere might be dated by an unauthorized version in the Winter Garden, New York, on 14 June 1911 (featuring Baldina alone from the Diaghilev cast). However, its authorized premiere on that continent, by Diaghilev Ballets Russes, was at the Century Theater, New York City, 20 January 1916, with Lydia Lopokova (who also featured in the unauthorized production five years earlier). Nijinsky danced it with that company at the Metropolitan Opera on 14 April 1916, where it was paired with a similar work to a piano suite (by Robert Schumann), Papillons, also choreographed by Fokine. Fokine also set the ballet for several other companies, and he and his wife, Vera Fokina, danced its leading roles themselves for some years.

Revision history[edit]
Original production[edit]
1909 set design by Alexandre Benois
Chopiniana, staged by Fokine, had a different musical composition. Also, Chopiniana was originally a compilation of dramatic or character dances set to Chopin's piano music. The Glazunov suite upon which this original version was based had only four Chopin pieces; Fokine wanted to use a waltz as an addition to the suite and was able to get Glazunov to orchestrate this to create his ballet, also called Chopiniana.

Polonaise in A major, Op. 40, No. 1
Nocturne in F major, Op. 15, No. 1
Mazurka in C♯ minor, Op. 50, No. 3
Waltz in C♯ minor, Op. 64, No. 2, as added by Michel Fokine[6]
Tarantella in A♭ major, Op. 43
The newly orchestrated waltz would be Fokine's inspiration to re-choreograph the ballet into its nearly-final form, selecting different Chopin pieces to go with it and getting these orchestrated by the Maryinsky répétiteur Maurice Keller.

Ballets Russes production[edit]
When Fokine's ballet premiered in Paris as part of Diaghilev's ""Saison Russe"" in 1909, Diaghilev commissioned re-orchestrations of all the dances, except for the Glazunov-orchestrated Waltz, by Anatoly Lyadov, Sergei Taneyev, Nikolai Tcherepnin and Igor Stravinsky.[6] This version, now titled Les Sylphides, was first staged at the Théâtre du Châtelet on 2 June 1909.[6]

Standard version[edit]
The canonical version of the ballet Les Sylphides includes:

Polonaise in A major (Military), Op. 40, No. 1 (some companies substitute the Prelude in A major, Op. 28, No. 7 instead)
Nocturne in A♭ major, Op. 32, No. 2
Waltz in G♭ major, Op. 70, No. 1
Mazurka in D major, Op. 33, No. 2
Mazurka in C major, Op. 67, No. 3
Prelude in A major, Op. 28, No. 7
Waltz in C♯ minor, Op. 64, No. 2
Grande valse brillante in E♭ major, Op. 18
New York City Ballet production[edit]
The New York City Ballet (NYCB) produced its own staging of the standard version, omitting the Polonaise in A major (and leaving the Prelude in A major in its original position), under the original title, Chopiniana. The NYCB premiere was staged by Alexandra Danilova and took place 20 January 1972, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center. The original cast included Karin von Aroldingen, Susan Hendl, Kay Mazzo, and Peter Martins.

Other orchestrations[edit]
A number of musicians have orchestrated the Chopin pieces for major ballet companies, including Maurice Ravel, Benjamin Britten, Alexander Gretchaninov,[6] Roy Douglas, and Gordon Jacob.[7] The Ravel orchestration has been lost.[8] The Britten orchestration was considered lost but a score thought to be his was found in 2013 in the archives of the American Ballet Theatre.[9]
Roy Douglas's version has been recorded a number of times, and has largely supplanted the earlier versions. It was written in 1936, to replace what Douglas called ""very bad orchestrations of Chopin's music"".[10]

Rita Sangalli as Sylvia in the 1876 production of the ballet
Sylvia, originally Sylvia, ou La nymphe de Diane, is a full-length classical ballet in two or three acts, first choreographed by Louis Mérante to music by Léo Delibes.
The ballet's premiere took place on 14 June 1876 at the Palais Garnier, but was largely unnoticed by the critics. The first seven productions were commercially unsuccessful, but the 1952 revival, choreographed by Frederick Ashton, popularized the work. Productions in 1997, 2004, 2005, and 2009 productions were all based on Ashton's choreography.


History[edit]
Preparations[edit]
Leo Delibes
The origins of the ballet Sylvia are in the Italian poet Tasso's play Aminta (1573), which provided the basic plot for the French composer Leo Delibes to set to music. Jules Barbier and Baron de Reinach adapted this for the Paris Opera.[1][2] The piano arrangement was composed in 1876 and the orchestral suite was done in 1880.[3]
In 1875, the Paris Opera chose Barbier and Reinach's libretto for Sylvia. The decision to invite Louis Mérante to choreograph the ballet was based primarily on Mérante's experience in the field and position as the premier maître de ballet at the Paris Opera. Other suitable choreographers were unavailable.[4]
Rehearsals for Sylvia began on 15 August 1875, when only the first third of the music was complete. Delibes revised his music throughout the rehearsal period, helped by Mérante and the lead dancer Rita Sangalli. The score's development was made more difficult by Mérante, who demanded that Delibes make changes to the score to accommodate the choreography.[4]

1876 premiere[edit]
Sylvia, ou la nymphe de Diane was the first ballet to be shown at the newly built Opera Garnier. The scenery for the ballet, designed by the artist Jules Chéret, was lavish but suffered from poor stage lighting. The costumes, designed by Lacoste were well appreciated. In the end it was Delibes' score that saved the production. Without such highly esteemed music, the ballet would have soon drifted into obscurity.
At the age of 27, Sangalli was the Opéra's principal ballerina and thus the obvious choice to star as Sylvia. Sangalli was described as having a ""superb physique"",[citation needed] but not spectacular dancing skills. Nonetheless, she was the only ballerina taught the rôle, and on one occasion the ballet had to be temporarily closed when she injured herself.[4]

1901 Russian production[edit]

Among the important versions of Sylvia, ou la nymphe de Diane that followed the original 1876 production in Paris was one presented by the Imperial Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia on 15 December [O.S. 2 December] 1901.[5][page needed]</ref> The ballet had been performed in Russia before. In 1886 the ballerina Antonietta Dell'Era, notable for creating the role of the Sugar Plum Fairy in The Nutcracker, had performed excerpts from Sylvia at the Arcadia Theatre of St. Petersburg, and in 1892, Carlotta Brianza, who created the role of Princess Aurora in The Sleeping Beauty, performed the full-length work at the Fantasia Theatre in Moscow.[5]
The Mariinsky Theatre's production was originally planned for the 1900–1901 season in a staging supervised by Sergei Diaghilev, with décors and costumes designed by Alexandre Benois and choreography by the brothers Sergei and Nikolai Legat.[5] But differences between Diaghilev and the director of the Imperial Theatres, Serge Wolkonsky, led to the project's cancellation as well as the end of Diaghilev's association with the Imperial Theatres, an event that led Diaghilev to eventually form the original Ballets Russes in 1909.[5] Nevertheless, the ballet was rescheduled for the 1901–1902 season in a version mounted by the Imperial Theatre's second maître de ballet Lev Ivanov, whose death in December 1901 caused the director to hand the project over to the noted premier danseur Pavel Gerdt.[5] Ivanov changed the ballet's title to Sylvia.[5] The cast included the great prima ballerina Olga Preobrajenska in the title role and the danseur Sergei Legat as the shepherd Aminta. Also included among the ballet's secondary characters was a young Agrippina Vaganova as a nymph of the Goddess Diana, and Pavel Gerdt in the rôle of Orion.[6]
Although the dances of the ballerina Preobrajenska were a great success, the first performance was not. The editor-publisher of the Saint Petersburg Gazette [ru], Sergei Khudekov [ru], himself a ballet expert and noted for co-authoring the librettos for several ballets staged at the Mariinsky,[7] was one of several critics who complained that the Ivanov/Gerdt choreography was of poor quality, and that the libretto was extremely slight.[5] Another element that contributed to the ballet's failure was the fact that the direction did not allow any new décors to be created, and instead sets were utilized from works that were no longer being performed.[5] After five performances Sylvia was removed from the company's repertoire;[5] excerpts from the ballet were included in gala events.[8]
The ballerina Anna Pavlova occasionally included many of these extracts from the 1902 production on her world tours in a revised staging by balletmaster Ivan Clustine.[8] In attendance for one of her London appearances was a young Frederick Ashton, whose memories of Pavlova's performance would inspire him to create his own renowned version in 1952, for the ballerina Margot Fonteyn.[9]

Other productions[edit]
1952: The Royal Ballet[edit]
Margot Fonteyn and Julia Farron in the 1952 production
Ashton re-choreographed Sylvia in 1952.[10] He placed a strong emphasis on the lead role, and designed the ballet as a tribute to Fonteyn. The American drama critic Clive Barnes noted that ""the whole ballet is a garland presented to the ballerina by her choreographer.""[10][11] Ashton's production was performed by the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, London on 3 September 1952. Ashton adjusted Barbier's libretto to increase the audience's interest in the story.
Along with Fonteyn,  Aminta was played by Michael Somes, and Orion by John Hart[12] and Eros by Alexander Grant.

2004: San Francisco Ballet[edit]
When the San Francisco Ballet opened their production of Sylvia in April 2004, it was the first time that the full ballet was shown in the United States. This production is also the only recent one not to be based on Ashton's work. At the request of Helgi Tomasson, Mark Morris choreographed it based on the original 1876 production and adhered quite closely to Mérante's methodology and style. As Morris said, ""I'm using the score and libretto exactly as they're built"".[13] Morris's reasoning behind this is quite simple: the nature of the music is inextricably intertwined with Louis Mérante's choreography, a consequence of the circumstances of composition. Because of this, Morris's revival of Sylvia is very true to the original, more so than any other recent production. The San Francisco Ballet performed Sylvia from April 21 through May 7, 2006, after successful runs in 2004 and 2005. At the premiere in 2004, the lead was Yuan Yuan Tan.[14][15]

2004: Royal Ballet[edit]
This production of Sylvia, the Royal Ballet's third, performed November 4 to December 3, 2004, as a part of the ""Ashton 100"" celebration, a season dedicated to the company's founder.[16] The ballet was recreated by Christopher Newton who (from both mental and visual records) reconstructed Ashton's original choreography and staged it for the Royal Ballet. While it ran, there were three different casts. The first consisted of Darcey Bussell and Jonathan Cope, the second of Zenaida Yanowsky and David Makhateli and the third of Marianela Núñez and Rupert Pennefather.[17]

2005: American Ballet Theatre[edit]

Ashton's Sylvia was also recently re-staged by Newton for The Metropolitan Opera House, where it was recently performed by the American Ballet Theatre. Newton's version is shortened (originally the ballet included some music from La Source) to be shown in two acts, with a musical break in place of the second intermission.
The last production at the Metropolitan Opera, as of June 4, 2005, had Paloma Herrera cast as Sylvia, Angel Corella as Aminta, Jesus Pastor as Orion, Craig Salstein as Eros and Carmen Corella as Diana.

2019: Houston Ballet[edit]
Choreographed by Stanton Welch AM of the Houston Ballet, this 2019 production of  Sylvia was co-produced with The Australian Ballet. Welch returned to the three-act format and elevated the roles of some of minor characters. He was joined by Jérôme Kaplan for sets and costumes, Lisa J. Pinkham for lighting, and Wendall K. Harrington for effects achieved with projections. The lead roles of Sylvia and the shepherd alternated between two duos: Karina Gonzalez and Connor Walsh, and Nozomi Iijima and Ian Casady.[18] The production subsequently made its Australian premiere in November 2019 at the Sydney Opera House.[19]

Style[edit]
Music[edit]
Sylvia is one of the first modern ballets.[20] Tchaikovsky himself remarked to fellow composer Sergei Taneyev upon the ingenuity of Sylvia, calling it ""... the first ballet, where the music constitutes not only the main, but the only interest. What charm, what elegance, what richness of melody, rhythm, harmony.""[21] While this statement may be a little hyperbolic, it says something very important about the uniqueness of the ballet. Sylvia's score is varied and rich, and it stands out, drawing the focus from the sets, the dancers, the costumes. Instead of receding into the background, setting only the mood, Delibes' score sets the action. The music of Sylvia was also notable for its new, more developed use of leitmotifs.[22] Such a stylistic choice is characteristic of Delibes, who was a great admirer of Wagner. Indeed, echoes of Wagner's influence are quite obvious in the music such as its ""symphonic"" nature, as described by Ivor Forbes Guest in the 1954 edition of The Ballet Annual.[4]
Another interesting choice of Delibes was his pronounced use of brass and wind instruments, especially in the characteristically powerful prelude. Delibes was also one of the first composers to write for the alto saxophone,[23] an instrument used extensively in the heavier wind sections such as the barcarolle in Act III.[3]
The prelude to the first act and the pizzicati in the third are the significantly more famous sections of this already notable score. The latter, the more famous, is a well-known example of pizzicato style. This section is, according to The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, ""traditionally played in a halting, hesitant style that appears to have been no part of Delibes's conception.""
Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake was written just before Sylvia was released and is generally considered[by whom?] one of the best ballets of the era. However, Tchaikovsky himself preferred Sylvia to his own work, calling his own masterpiece ""poor stuff in comparison"".[10] Tchaikovsky said to Taneyev, ""I was ashamed. If I had known this music early then, of course, I would not have written Swan Lake"".

Choreography[edit]
Angel Corella in a 2005 performance as Aminta, from an ABT production of Frederick Ashton's ballet Sylvia
Louis Mérante's choreography for Sylvia was praised by contemporary critics, but it did not survive the ballet's initial run at the Paris Opera. 
Sir Frederick Ashton created quite contemporary choreography for his 1952 production at the Royal Opera House, while retaining a classic feel, it has been modernized. In the 1952 choreography, Sylvia incorporated new and interesting techniques such as the blending of mime and dance and more intricate footwork, as are typical of Ashton's works.[10][11] As writer Arnold Haskell said, ""he accepts the challenge in Sylvia of coping with period music without descending to pastiche; and never once does the movement he provides strike us as modern or as 'old world'"".[10] Gillian Murphy, the lead rôle in the 2005 ABT production, noted this choreography was very challenging. Ashton designed the ballet specifically around Fonteyn's talent and skill. Thus, any who play the part must be able to do everything she could, and at the time ""the range of her dancing [was] unequalled""(Barnes).[10][24]
It is notable that this choreography features a few difficult pas de deux, including a spectacular one in the third act, which constitutes the climax of the ballet.

Characters[edit]
Lead roles[edit]
Sylvia – A chaste huntress nymph, loyal to Diana, object of Aminta's desire.
Aminta – A simple shepherd boy who is in love with Sylvia. Parallels can be drawn to Endymion, another shepherd who was Diana's young love.
Eros – The Greek god of love, focal in the ballet as an object of great worship and scorn.
Diana – The Roman goddess of the hunt and chastity. It is at Diana's temple that the bacchanal in the third act takes place.
Orion – An evil hunter who stalks Sylvia and kidnaps her.

Minor roles[edit]
Hunt attendants—Sylvia's posse of female hunters.
Goats – Two goats that are about to be sacrificed as a tribute to Bacchus, but are saved by the commotion caused by Orion.
Naiads
Dryads
Fauns
Peasants

Libretto[edit]
Frederick Ashton recognised the weakness of the libretto, and reworked the ballet to help make the story more interesting.[10] Mark Morris simplified the story for his 2004 production for the same reasons. He called it, ""a big wonderful mishmash of mythology and history"", so he changed it to make it more ""clear and beautiful"".[25]

Act I: A Sacred Wood[edit]
The ballet begins with a scene of worship as creatures of the forest dance before Eros. Aminta, a lowly shepherd, stumbles in on them, disrupting their ritual. Now Sylvia, the object of Aminta's desire, arrives on the scene with her posse of hunters to mock the god of love. Aminta attempts to conceal himself, but Sylvia eventually discovers her stalker and, inflamed, turns her bow towards Eros. Aminta protects the deity and is himself wounded. Eros in turn shoots Sylvia. She is hit, and though not badly wounded, the injury is enough to drive her offstage.
A hunter, Orion, is revealed to also have been watching Sylvia, when he is seen celebrating the unconscious Aminta. Orion conceals himself again as Sylvia returns; this time she is sympathetic towards Aminta. As the huntress laments over her victim, she is kidnapped by Orion and carried off. Peasants grieve over Aminta's figure until a cloaked Eros revives the shepherd. Eros reveals his true identity and informs Aminta of Orion's actions.

Act II: Orion's Island Cave[edit]
Captive in Orion's island hideout, Sylvia is tempted by him with jewels and wine to no avail. Sylvia now grieves over Aminta, cherishing the arrow pulled from her breast nostalgically. When Orion steals it from her, Sylvia gets her captor drunk until he is unconscious, whereby she retrieves her arrow and appeals to Eros for help. Sylvia's invocations are not in vain, for Eros quickly arrives and shows his summoner a vision of Aminta waiting for her. The duo depart for the temple of Diana, where Sylvia's love awaits.

Act III: The Sea Coast near the Temple of Diana[edit]
Aminta arrives at the temple of Diana to find a bacchanal but no Sylvia, who will soon arrive with Eros. After a few moments of mirth at the reunion, Orion shows up, seeking Sylvia. He and Aminta fight; Sylvia barricades herself in Diana's shrine and Orion attempts to follow. The goddess of the hunt, outraged at this act, smites Orion and denies Aminta and Sylvia congress. Compassionate Eros gives Diana a vision. The goddess reminisces over her own young love of Endymion, also a shepherd. Diana has a change of heart and repeals her decree. Aminta and Sylvia come together under the deities' good will.

This list mentions only full-length or otherwise significant productions; however, there have been many performances of short excerpts, especially in London.

In popular culture[edit]
In the 1892 novel written by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith The Diary of a Nobody, Carrie Pooter practises the Sylvia Gavotte on the Pooters' new cottage piano, 'bought on the three years system, manufactured by W. Bilkson (in small letters) from Collard and Collard (in very large letters)'.
In the 1931 Marx Brothers film Monkey Business, Chico Marx plays the pizzicato on the piano, racing against the orchestra, and says, ""Hah, I beat you that time!""[32]
The theme song from the 1982 television series Knight Rider is based on ""Cortège de Bacchus"" from the third act.[33]
In one episode of The Muppet Show, the pizzicato is played in one sketch that features characters with balloons for heads, including the conductor, who leads the balloon-headed orchestra into popping their heads in time. The sketch ends with the conductor popping his own balloon head.
In the movie Babe (film), the pizzicato strings create a supported tension as Babe and Ferdinand the Duck sneak into the Hoggett house to steal an alarm clock, aka ""The Mechanical Rooster.""

Symphonic VariationsChoreographerFrederick AshtonPremiere24 April 1946Royal Opera House, LondonOriginal ballet companySadler's Wells BalletDesignSophie Fedorovitch
Symphonic Variations is a one-act ballet by Frederick Ashton set to the eponymous music (M. 46) of César Franck. The premiere, performed by the Sadler's Wells Ballet, took place at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 24 April 1946 in a triple bill; the other works were Ashton's Les Patineurs and Robert Helpmann's Adam Zero. The ballet was conducted by Constant Lambert and the set designed by Sophie Fedorovitch.[1]


Background[edit]
During the Second World War, Ashton listened to Franck's Symphonic Variations a great deal and he decided to develop an elaborate scenario to be set to the music. Constant Lambert, music director for the Sadler's Wells Ballet,[2] at first objected to the use of Franck's music for a ballet; Ashton dropped his original scenario and created an abstract ballet. During the war, the repertory had become increasingly literary, and Ashton's purpose was to counteract this.[3] It was not his intention to display ingenuity of invention but to construct a more abstract piece, setting three men and three women dancing on the vast expanse of the Opera House stage uncluttered with scenery and effect.[4]

Description[edit]
The critic A V Coton described the ballet:

The curtain rises on a vast stage, and before the deep-set backcloth of sprayed white and green are seen six immobile and minute dancers, clad all in white, with a little black relief here and there. Nothing is stated about place, person, condition or circumstance. ...The disparity between these persons and all the vast area of their action proposes an imagery of infinities. ... In each of these instances a choreographer of assured mastery, moving perhaps to some degree deliberately, and to some extent intuitively, has re-stated the primary function of theatrical dancing by re-shaping in basic material into a new and exciting assemblage of images.[5]
Casts[edit]
Symphonic Variations. Sadler's Wells Ballet in Poznan, 1947
In the opening season the cast was

Margot Fonteyn
Moira Shearer
Pamela May
Michael Somes
Brian Shaw
Henry Danton
In the following season Shaw and Danton were replaced by John Hart and Alexander Grant.[6] In the first production and early revivals the work was regarded as making such demands on the dancers that they took no part in any other ballet on the same evening's bill.[7] Margaret Dale in conversation with David Vaughan commented, ""Even though Symphonic Variations more than any other ballet creates a feeling of serenity, for the dancers, in the beginning it was an 'absolute marathon', and made demands on them that had never been made before. ... It was a test of sheer stamina that very few British dancers could stand at that time.""[7]

Critical reception[edit]
From the premiere onwards the work has been highly regarded by critics. The Manchester Guardian called the choreography ""rare, brave and stimulating"", with the reservation that the prominence of the concertante piano part in the score was not mirrored in a similarly prominent part for the prima ballerina.[8] The Observer thought the piece ""charming and exciting"".[9] The Times said:

Mr. Frederick Ashton has devised a ballet for six dancers without drama and without characterisation – a ""pure"" ballet, in which the interest is wholly concentrated upon the dance and its relation to the music. That the new ballet holds one's attention from the first motionless tableau until the dancers sink into repose again at the end is a measure of Mr. Ashton's success.[10]
Later critics have regarded the work similarly highly. A V Coton of The Daily Telegraph asserted in 1967 that Symphonic Variations ""remains [Ashton's] absolute and indisputable masterpiece – a perfect fusion of ideas about stylised dance, light, space, romantic-lyric music and heroic costume – which creates a spectacle that calls into question the value of almost every other ballet in the modern repertoire"".[11] John Percival of The Times remarked of the same production, ""Fittingly, the centrepiece of this programme was a revival of Symphonic Variations … as many of us think the best work ever created for this company"".[12]
In 2004, Cristina Franchi described it as ""A pure classical dance work of great beauty and simplicity.""[13]

Revivals[edit]
In November 1967, the Royal Ballet staged a revival of three works by Ashton: Symphonic Variations was part of that triple bill with Les Patineurs and Persephone. The dancers in Symphonic Variations were:

Merle Park
Ann Jenner
Jennifer Penny
Donald MacLeary
Graham Usher
Michael Coleman
The work has been toured by the Royal Ballet and Birmingham Royal Ballet companies, with productions in 1970, with Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell in the cast, and 1992, under the direction of Michael Somes.[14] Other companies have staged the work, including the Dutch National Ballet (1989); American Ballet Theatre (1992); the National Ballet of Canada (1996); and San Francisco Ballet (2004).This piece has also been performed by the University of North Carolina School of the Arts (2018), being the only school to have ever performed the work.

Ballet by George Balanchine


Symphony in CChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicGeorges BizetPremiereJuly 28, 1947 (1947-07-28)Théâtre National de l'Opéra, ParisOriginal ballet companyParis Opera BalletDesignLeonor FiniGenreNeoclassical ballet
Symphony in C, originally titled Le Palais de Cristal, is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine, to Georges Bizet's Symphony in C. The ballet was originally created for the Paris Opera Ballet, and premiered on July 28, 1947 at Théâtre National de l'Opéra.[1]


Production[edit]
External videos Joseph Gordon on George Balanchine's SYMPHONY IN C: Anatomy of a Dance, YouTube video Sara Mearns on SYMPHONY IN C: Anatomy of a Dance, YouTube video ""Le Palais de cristal"" (Symphony in C) - George Balanchine, YouTube video
Georges Bizet (1838 – 1875) wrote Symphony in C when he was 17-year-old student, and the score was not found until 1933. Composer Igor Stravinsky informed choreographer George Balanchine about this discovery.[2] In 1947, as a guest ballet master at the Paris Opera Ballet,[3] Balanchine choreographed the ballet, then titled Le Palais de Cristal, to ""showcase for the talent of the whole company.""[1] Balanchine paid homage to Léo Staats, a French choreographer he admired.[4] According to NYCB, Balanchine created the ballet within two weeks.[3] The following year, he restaged the ballet for Ballet Society, under the title Symphony in C, and this version was featured in New York City Ballet's first program.[5] Choreographer Jerome Robbins was in the audience, and decided to join the company after seeing the ballet.[6]
The ballet has four movements, each featuring a principal couple, two demi-soloist couples and the corps de ballet. In the finale, the whole cast appears on stage.[1] When NYCB was based at the New York City Center, the stage was too small for the entire cast to appear in the finale, but this became possible when the company moved to the New York State Theater.[7]
Symphony in C had since entered the repertories of Royal Danish Ballet, Dutch National Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet, The Royal Ballet, Kirov Ballet and the American Ballet Theatre.[1][8]

Costumes[edit]
In the original Paris version, each movement references a gemstone, including Rubies, Black Diamonds, Emeralds and Pearls, with the dancers wearing red, black, green and white costumes, designed by Leonor Fini. Balanchine later used this idea again in Jewels.[1][9]
In 1950, NYCB started donning black-and-white costumes designed by Barbara Karinska. In 2012, NYCB commissioned Marc Happel to design costumes for the ballet that had a ""more modern, yet still timeless look"". He kept the black and white scheme, and used crystals provided by Swarovski.[10]
The Royal Ballet's production uses costumes and sets by former artistic director Anthony Dowell. Like the Karinska design, men are dressed in black, and women are in white tutus.[2]

Videography[edit]
A 2016 NYCB touring performance at Théâtre du Châtelet, Paris, was filmed and released through PBS' Great Performances and on a DVD titled New York City Ballet in Paris.[11][12]

Ballet choreographed by George Balanchine


Symphony in Three MovementsChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicIgor StravinskyPremiereJune 18, 1972 (1972-06-18)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletGenreneoclassical ballet
Symphony in Three Movements is a neoclassical ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to the music of the same name by Stravinsky. The ballet was made for the New York City Ballet Stravinsky Festival in 1972, a tribute to the composer following his death. The ballet premiered on June 18, 1972, at the New York State Theater.


Production[edit]
Balanchine and Stravinsky had collaborated for many years until the latter's death in 1971. As a tribute to the composer, Balanchine decided to have his company, the New York City Ballet, hold the weeklong Stravinsky Festival.[1][2] The festival included 22 premieres,[1] seven by Balanchine.[3]: 317  One of Stravinsky's works chosen for the festival was Symphony in Three Movements, which was written during the Second World War for different aborted film projects, though he admitted it referenced the war.[1][4]
Despite its complex choreography, intricate music and large cast, Balanchine completed the ballet in a week due to the pressures of the festival.[1] Gordon Boelzner, the company's pianist and associate conductor, recalled, ""[Balanchine] just tossed off steps without hesitation."" He added, ""He threw whole chunks of choreography at the dancers. I couldn't make head or tail of what was going on. Then Balanchine took one afternoon to clean it all up, and all of a sudden it came absolutely clear.""[3]: 25  Edward Villella, one of the original cast members, called Stravinsky's score ""the single most complicated score I had ever danced to."" He added, ""During rehearsals, despite all my experience dancing Stravinsky, I couldn't really hear the music and couldn't count it.""[5] Balanchine's assistant Barbara Hagan recalled Sara Leland, another original cast member and a newly promoted principal dancer, ""was a quick learner"", while ""Balanchine really struggled with Symphony with regard to tempos"", therefore Balanchine used Leland to demonstrate the steps to the corps de ballet.[6]
After she retired, Leland, known for her ability to remember choreography, went on to stage and coach ballets, including Symphony in Three Movements. Christine Redpath, a New York City Ballet repertory director who would also stage the ballet, noted Leland had memorized all the difficult counts.[6]

Choreography[edit]
The first movement begins with sixteen women in a diagonal line, before the six principal dancers and five soloist couples enter. Critic Zoe Anderson described, ""Dancers leap on, followed by small entourages, or spin their way among the jogging corps.""[1][4] Villella noted dancing to the first movement was ""the biggest musical challenge I had ever faced"".[5]
The second movement is a pas de deux. Anderson called this movement ""both sensuous and remote"". She added, ""Although there is some partnering, the dancers keep an emotional and sometimes physical distance.""[1]
The full cast returns for the third and final movement.[7] Villella wrote, ""The movement for everyone here is aggressive, mysterious and frightening.""[5] The New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff noted, ""Stravinsky's allusion to an Allied victory in World War II is not to be taken literally. But the triumphant note is translated in the massed groupings on stage: Dancers frozen in semaphores and abstractions of warriors at the ready.""[4]

Original cast[edit]
The principal dancers at the premiere of Symphony in Three Movements  were:[3]: 415 

Sara Leland
Marnee Morris
Lynda Yourth
Helgi Tomasson
Edward Villella
Robert Weiss
Performances[edit]
Symphony in Three Movements premiered on June 18, 1972, at the New York State Theater.[3]: 415  Other companies that have performed the ballet include the San Francisco Ballet and Boston Ballet.[8][9]

Notes[edit]
This ballet took place in ancient India, and was a rather mediocre success upon its première. The principal attraction of the balletomanes and critics was Drigo's score. The artist Alexander Benois told in his memoirs (titled Mémoirs) of his extreme delight with Drigo's score, which he said inspired a ""short infatuation"" in him as a young student at the Saint Petersburg State University - ""It was Drigo's simple and charming music that had attracted both Valetchka (Walter Nouvelle - member of Mir iskusstva) and me to Petipa's 'The Talisman'. In fact we had been so delighted with it at the première that our noisy approval had attracted the attention, and seemed to shock, the then rather popular St. Petersburg General Governor Grösser ... he turned round (from his permanent seat in the front row stalls), affecting a severe expression, and shook his finger at us. My enthusiasm was so great, however, that I could not stop applauding and even felt compelled to exclaim ""Mais puisque, Excellence, c'est un chef d'œuvre!"" - upon which his Excellency deigned to bestow on me a fatherly smile.""

Prologue — In the clouds
The gods and spirits descend to meet the Goddess Amravati, Queen of the heavens (Valse des esprits). She is in despair, and is asked why. She replies ""It is today, in accordance with my immortal husband's wishes, that my daughter, the goddess Niriti, must descend to earth, and perhaps may never return.""
Music heralds the entrance of Niriti (Entrée de Niriti). She runs to embrace her mother, and is then informed that the time has come for her to visit the earth. ""But why must I visit the earth?"" Niriti asks. ""To test your heart against the temptations of earthly love,"" replies Amravati, ""and should you fail, you will forfeit your right to immortality."" ""Must I go alone?"" asks Niriti. ""No,"" replies the goddess; ""I have chosen a fine companion for you.""
Vayou, the god of the wind, flies overhead, bringing a storm in his wake (Le vent de Vayou). He bows to the Queen and begs pardon for his tardiness; ""A group of mortals dared to attempt to learn the secrets of the poles,"" he says, ""for which I was forced to sink their ships.""
Queen Amravati hands Vayou her golden mace, which makes him ruler of the spirits and of all the elements. She then takes a star from her crown and gives it to Niriti. ""This talisman shall protect you against all danger which may befall you."" The Goddess adds, ""However, should she lose it, you shall never return to the heavens again."" ""But,"" enquires Niriti, ""surely the mace shall force the talisman to be returned to me."" ""No,"" replies Amravati, ""a talisman lost by a maiden of the air must be freely returned to her by whatever mortal may come to possess it.""
Amravati bids her daughter farewell. Niriti and Vayou descend to the earth.
Act I — The hut of the old weaver Kadoor
Nal is working busily at his loom so that he may meet Nirilya, his betrothed. He is then distracted by a sun-beam which dazzles his eyes so that he decides to cover the window with his cloak. As he goes toward it his beloved Nirilya appears. He begs her to enter, but she refuses. Nal, annoyed, returns to his work. Nirilya creeps behind him and covers his eyes with her hands.
Enter Kadoor, accompanied by his friends and relatives. The lovers are embarrassed. The weaver tells them that they have nothing to be ashamed of, for they are to be married on the following day. He reminds them of their friends who have come to wish them happiness. The young people begin dancing while the old weaver and some of his guests decorate the hut with flowers and garlands (Danse des amis de Nirilya et Nal).
Towards the conclusion of their dances a handsome youth appears - Noureddin, the young Maharajah of Lahore. He has lost his way while hunting and asks for shelter for the night. Kadoor welcomes the visitor and places refreshments before him. Noureddin begs the young people to continue their dancing, so Nirilya and Nal perform a joyous dance to the delight of the young Maharajah (Danse orientale), who gives Nirilya a necklace and Nal a purse of gold. Then, feeling tired, Noureddin asks to be shown to his room. The guests leave and darkness falls. There is distant thunder and lightning.
Enter Niriti and Vayou (Premières sensations). Niriti enquires where they are. Vayou asks her to remain while he goes to explore. Feeling tired from their travels, Niriti lies down and falls asleep.
Noureddin comes out of his room, rubbing his eyes, having been disturbed by a strange noise. He catches sight of the sleeping Niriti, and is amazed by her beauty. Niriti awakens. Frightened by the stranger she attempts to flee, but Noureddin holds her firm and demands a kiss. Struggling violently, she calls to Vayou for help. Suddenly Vayou appears and seizes Niriti while brandishing the golden mace. There is a violent gust of wind and Niriti and Vayou disappear. During the escape, the talisman falls from Niriti's head. Noureddin searches vainly for Niriti and discovers the talisman. Convinced that he has met his true love, he swears to find the beautiful girl.
Enter King Akdar and his daughter, the Princess Damayanti, attended by a magnificent retinue. The King expresses his delight at seeing Noureddin, as his daughter, to whom Noureddin is betrothed, had been troubled by his disappearance. The company now departs, and the King requests that Noureddin follow them.
Niriti and Vayou reappear, followed by spirits of the earth. They search anxiously for the talisman, but in vain.
Act II — The gardens of King Akdar's magnificent palace in Dehli
Servants are completing the preparations for the feast which will prelude the wedding of the Princess Damayanti and Noureddin. Enter King Akdar and his daughter, who seat themselves upon the throne. They are attended by rajahs, bayadères, eunuchs and the Princess's attendants. Noureddin enters, followed by his bodyguard Djemil and several of his guards.
The festival begins with various diversions (Danse nautch, Danse de l’hindoustan), with Noureddin and the Princess Damayanti performing a dance together in which the young Maharajah is haunted by visions of Niriti (Grand pas d’action). At the end the chief eunuch announces that the feast is ready in the great hall of the palace. Noureddin lingers behind. He cannot forget the beautiful girl he encountered in Kadoor's hut.
Moonlight filters into the garden. As Noureddin begins to leave to attend the feast a rose-bush springs from the ground and bars his way. Other bushes appear and from each emerges a rose in human form. From the center rose-bush comes Niriti in the guise of the Goddess of the Flowers, and from each side appear the spirits of the earth. With bewitching glances they ask him to give up the talisman, but when Noureddin refuses they vanish. Niriti and her retinue of flowers perform dances to entice Noureddin into giving up the talisman (Grand ballabile — La Rose de Bengale), but to no avail. Niriti and her retinue disappear.
Fanfares announcing King Akdar are heard. ""Come!"" cries the King, ""the priests are waiting to perform the wedding ceremony."". Noureddin, unable to forget Niriti, confesses that he loves another and must refuse the Princess Damayanti's hand. The Princess then faints into the arms of her attendants and the enraged King draws his sword; his guards follows suit. At that moment Noureddin's guards place themselves in a posture defense to protect him. A terrible struggle is imminent when flames rise from the earth and separate the antagonists. Vayou has devised this to save Noureddin so that he may return Niriti her talisman.
Niriti appears in the fountain and, unseen, wafts him a passionate kiss. Her heart has been melted by his indomitable love.
Act III, tableau 1 — A bazaar on the banks of the river Ganges
It is market-day and the bazaar is crowded with types of the numerous races of India. Noureddin enters with his troops on his way back to Lahore. He calls a halt and lies down to rest. The talisman can be seen glittering from his breast. At a sign from one of the slave-dealers dancing begins (Danse des montagnards de l’Himalaya, Pas Katchack).
Enter Vayou and Niriti, who are disguised as a Brahim and his slave. Vayou presents Niriti to the crowd wrapped in a long veil (Danse sous le voile). Recognising Noureddin, they decide to steal the talisman, but Noureddin recognises Niriti, who tries to hide among the crowd. Noureddin pursues her but is stopped by Vayou, who reproaches him for annoying his slave. ""Will you sell me your slave?"" asks Noureddin. ""Yes,"" replies the Brahmin, ""in exchange for the talisman on your breast."" Noureddin refuses. Vayou and the supposed slave depart.
Noureddin is now suspicious that the talisman should be preferred to the wealth he could have offered and feels that there is some mystery connected to it. He wonders if the slave-owner's tongue might be loosened with wine and, calling his bodyguard Djemil, whispers his orders.
Niriti and Vayou return. Noureddin goes to them and asks the Brahmin to taste a new European drink: perhaps it may help them come to an understanding. Vayou drinks and, finding the drink greatly to his taste, continually asks for his glass to be refilled. Thus, Vayou becomes increasingly communicative and confides that his slave is really the Goddess Amravati's daughter, and so long as Noureddin possesses the talisman, Niriti must remain on earth. To emphasize his word his Vayou strikes the table with his golden mace, which snaps in two. He continues to drink until he falls to the ground (Scène dansante — L’ivresse de Vayou).
Noureddin orders the bodyguard Djemil to seize Niriti, who desperately calls for Vayou to help her. He awakes but, stupefied with wine, is helpless. Niriti is led away.
Act III, tableau II — Some ancient ruins at night
Niriti is brought in by the bodyguard Djemil and placed before Noureddin, who orders his men to keep strict watch. Niriti then beseeches Noureddin to restore her talisman. He replies that he cannot, for if he does she shall return to heaven, and he loves her too much to allow it (La danse à l’amour). She admits that he speaks the truth, but implores him to help her return to heaven and her mother.
Noureddin refuses because he wishes for her to remain on earth and be his wife and queen, but Niriti refuses. Noureddin pleads on his knees, but again she refuses. He then reminds her that she is in his power and has no choice but to cede to his wishes. Niriti then plucks a dagger from Noureddin's belt and threatens to stab herself. He quickly wrests the weapon from her and, furious that she should hold his love for her so lightly, snatches the talisman from his breast and throws it at her feet. There is a deafening clap of thunder.
Act III, tableau III — At the top of the stage is seen the heavens, at the bottom, the ancient ruins
The Goddess Amravati awaits Niriti's return. Niriti, clasping her talisman, is about to ascend when she resolves to bid Noureddin farewell. Seeing his eyes filled with tears she is overcome with sadness herself. She begins to wonder whether celestial delights can equal the earthly happiness which Noureddin offers, and which she is about to sacrifice. She wavers, then drops the talisman and throws herself into Noureddin's arms.
Apotheosis
The talisman ascends to heaven. Seated on her throne, the Goddess Amravati is surrounded by gods and other heavenly spirits.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The Taming of the ShrewChoreographerJohn CrankoMusicDomenico Scarlatti, arranged by Kurt-Heinz StolzeBased onThe Taming of the Shrew by William ShakespearePremiere16 March 1969Staatsoper, StuttgartOriginal ballet companyStuttgart BalletDesignElisabeth DaltonSettingItaly, 16th century
The Taming of the Shrew is a ballet in two acts choreographed by John Cranko to keyboard works by Domenico Scarlatti arranged and orchestrated by Kurt-Heinz Stolze. With scenery and costumes designed by Elizabeth Dalton, it was first presented as Der Widerspenstigen Zähmung by the Stuttgart Ballet at the Wṻrtembergische Staatstheater in Stuttgart on 16 March 1969.[1]


Background[edit]
Cranko's ballet is a dance version of William Shakespeare's play The Taming of the Shrew (1590–1592). The story is a comedy about Petruchio's determination to subdue the irascible Katherine; he woos her, marries her, and makes her an obedient wife.[2] Shakespeare chose his title to signify to his audiences that the play was about the marriage of a man to an ill-tempered woman given to scolding, nagging, and aggression. Such a woman, especially a wife, was known in the sixteenth century as a shrew, so called after a tiny rodent with a notoriously hostile and unpleasant nature.[3] A woman convicted in court for being a shrew was often punished in Shakespeare's day by being confined to stocks on the village green or repeatedly dunked in a nearby pond or lake.[4]

Scenario[edit]
The setting is Padua, a city in northern Italy, not far from Venice. Three suitors—Hortensio, Lucentio, and Gremio—come to Baptista's house to serenade Bianca, his younger daughter. Baptista declares that Bianca shall not marry until her older sister, Katherina, is wed. An ensuing rumpus is dispelled when Katherina angrily sends everyone packing. In a tavern, a tipsy Petruchio is robbed of his money. Hortensio, Lucentio, and Gremio offer to introduce him to an heiress. He accepts and determines to ""wive it wealthily in Padua."" At Baptista's house, Petruchio asks for Katherina's hand. After a stormy courtship, she agrees. Bianca's three suitors press their case. Bianca favors Lucentio. The first act culminates at Katherina and Petruchio's wedding, where he arrives late and behaves outrageously. He carries off his bride without waiting for the festivities to begin.
At Petruchio's house, the newly wedded couple are at supper, but he does not allow her to eat, protesting that the food is not good enough. She refuses to consummate the marriage and spends the night on the kitchen floor. Then, at a carnival, Lucentio tricks Hortensio and Gremio into marrying two ladies of the street, thus clearing his way to woo Bianca on his own.  Petruchio's mockery and trickery continue to provoke Katherina. Eventually she surrenders, and they admit that they love each other. On the way to Bianca's wedding, Petruchio indulges in some whims, but Katherina has learned to humor him. At the wedding, Bianca treats her husband scornfully, but Katherina shows her how a wife is expected to behave. Left alone, she and Petruchio revel in their new-found love.[5]

Original cast[edit]
Marcia Haydée – Katherina (Kate)
Richard Cragun – Petruchio
Susanne Hanke – Bianca
Egon Madsen – Gremio
Heinz Claus – Lucentio
John Neumeier – Hortensio
Critical reception[edit]
Cranko's ballet was an immediate success, with Richard Cragun winning particular acclaim for his performance as Petruchio. ""Cragun was a strikingly handsome Petruchio, by turns self-mocking, overbearing, funny, and tender. The role suited his robustly masculine and charismatic stage personality and provided a first-class showcase for his virtuosity and partnering skills.[6] A reviewer of an early performance in Stuttgart wrote, ""I have been trying to think when—or whether—I ever laughed so much at a ballet as I did at John Cranko's The Taming of the Shrew. . . . Perhaps the subject sounds an unlikely one for dancing, but to think so is to leave out of account Cranko's absolute genius for comic invention.""[7]

Videography[edit]
The Stuttgart Ballet: The Miracle Lives, a video recording, includes an excerpt from The Taming of the Shrew, danced by Marcia Haydée and Richard Cragun (West Long Branch, N.J.: Kultur International Films Ltd., 1983). Ballerina, a BBC Television recording produced and directed by Derek Bailey (London: BBC TV, 1987), also includes an excerpt from the ballet but is currently not commercially available.

Igor Youskevitch

Theme and Variations is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to the final movement of Tchaikovsky's Orchestral Suite No. 3. The ballet was made for Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre), and premiered on November 26, 1947, at the City Center 55 Street Theater, with the two leads danced by Alicia Alonso and Igor Youskevitch.
The ballet was well-received and was revived by other ballet companies. In 1970, Balanchine incorporated the choreography of Theme and Variations to Suite No. 3 (now titled Tschaikovsky Suite No. 3),[a] performed by the New York City Ballet.


Production[edit]
Tempe Ostergren and Kansas City Ballet dancers Theme and Variations
Balanchine's Theme and Variations is set to the final movement of Tchaikovsky's Orchestral Suite No. 3.[2] It was commissioned by Lucia Chase for Ballet Theatre (now American Ballet Theatre).[2] The sets and costumes of the original production were designed by Woodman Thompson.[3]
The ballet is plotless and abstract.[2] Like Ballet Imperial (now titled Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2),[a] Balanchine made Theme and Variations as a tribute to the Imperial Russian ballet style, and he wrote that the ballet was intended ""to evoke that great period in classical dancing when Russian ballet flourished with the aid of Tchaikovsky's music.""[4]: 175 [5]: 22  It is also regarded as his tribute to Imperial Russian Theater and the ballet The Sleeping Beauty.[6]: 22 
The ballet features a lead couple, created on Alicia Alonso and Igor Youskevitch, plus four soloists and a corps de ballet.[3] Mary Ellen Moylan, who had trained under Balanchine, was offered the female principal role and was asked to join Ballet Theatre, though she opted to rejoin Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo.[7] While making the ballet, Youskevitch and Balanchine disagreed as the former wanted to dance like a prince from Swan Lake or Giselle, but Balanchine wanted him to focus on the steps only.[5]: 22  Alonso previously believed that ballet cannot be abstract, and stated she ""always have a feeling of being just behind the music"" during rehearsals with Balanchine. She also said Balanchine kept giving her and Youskevitch more ""complex steps,"" hoping to eliminate their personalities.[8]: 68  However, the presence of their personalities remained obvious. In rehearsals, Balanchine neither criticized nor approved them, although Youskevitch was convinced that their ""romanticized"" interpretations were not accepted by Balanchine.[8]: 112  Alonso nevertheless noted she ""learned a lot"" through Theme and Variations, especially ""to listen to each instrument individually,"" which became helpful when her eyesight got worse.[8]: 112 

Premiere[edit]
Theme and Variations premiered on November 26, 1947, at the City Center 55 Street Theater.[5]: 405–406  It was well-received by both critics and the audience.[5]: 22  Lincoln Kirstein, who co-founded the Ballet Society with Balanchine, was pleased that Balanchine achieved success, but jealous that it was with another company.[5]: 22–23  In a letter to Igor Stravinsky on Boxing Day 1947, Kirstein wrote that he and Pavel Tchelitchev both thought Theme and Variations was not Balanchine's best work, ""but it appealed madly to the public,"" and believed that Balanchine had ""become recognized"" after spending fifteen years in the United States.[5]: 22–23

Revivals[edit]
The Royal Ballet's Darcey Bussell and Carlos Acosta at the curtain call of Theme and Variations
Balanchine debut as an orchestral conductor during a Ballet Theatre performance of Theme and Variations in December 1947.[10] Months after the world premiere of Theme and Variations, the ballet was performed in Cuba, Alicia Alonso's home country, with her and original cast members Igor Youskevitch, Melissa Hayden and Fernando Alonso, alongside members of Ballet Alicia Alonso (now Cuban National Ballet).[8]: 110 
Balanchine's company, the New York City Ballet, performed Theme and Variations for the first time in 1960, with the two lead roles danced by Violette Verdy and Edward Villella respectively. However, Verdy had already danced the ballet with Ballet Theatre before. The costumes of this production were designed by Karinska.[11]
In 1970, when Balanchine made Suite No. 3, (now titled Tschaikovsky Suite No. 3),[a] a ballet to the whole suite, he incorporated the choreography of Theme and Variations.[12][13] At the premiere, the Theme and Variations portion was danced by Edward Villella and Gelsey Kirkland.[12]
Other ballet companies that had performed Theme and Variations include The Royal Ballet,[14] Kirov Ballet,[15] San Francisco Ballet,[16] Dutch National Ballet,[17] Birmingham Royal Ballet,[18] Boston Ballet,[19] Pacific Northwest Ballet,[20] Houston Ballet,[21] Royal Danish Ballet and Les Grands Ballets Canadiens.[22]

The Three-Cornered Hat (Spanish: El sombrero de tres picos or Le tricorne) is a ballet choreographed by Léonide Massine to music by Manuel de Falla. It was commissioned by Sergei Diaghilev and premiered in 1919. It is not only a ballet with Spanish setting but one that also employs the techniques of Spanish dance (adapted and somewhat simplified) instead of classical ballet.[1]


Composition history[edit]
In 1916-17, Manuel de Falla composed the music for Gregorio Martínez Sierra's two-scene pantomime El corregidor y la molinera (The Magistrate and the Miller's Wife), built on Pedro Antonio de Alarcón's 1874 novel of the same title. The work premiered at Madrid's Teatro Eslava on April 6, 1917.
Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes had been introduced to de Falla by Igor Stravinsky during the company's first visit to Spain in 1916. He requested permission to use de Falla's already-completed Noches en los jardines de España (Nights in the Gardens of Spain) and the work-in-progress El corregidor y la molinera for future choreographies, but only managed to secure permission for the latter.
In preparation for producing Spanish choreography, Diaghilev and Leonid Massine enlisted the services of dancer Félix Fernández García, who accompanied the two men with de Falla on a tour of Spain in July 1917, introducing them to dancers and performances in Zaragoza, Toledo, Salamanca, Burgos, Sevilla, Córdoba, and Granada. Massine, Pablo Picasso, and de Falla worked separately on the choreography, sets/costumes, and music for the ballet over subsequent months; after some delays, the ballet was eventually premiered in London at the Alhambra Theatre on 22 July 1919. De Falla was called home to Granada at the last moment to see his dying mother; the premiere was conducted in his stead by Ernest Ansermet.

Structure[edit]
The story of a magistrate infatuated with a miller's faithful wife, whom he attempts to seduce, derives from the novella of the same name by Pedro Antonio de Alarcón.[2] Falla did not prepare ""suites"" from this work although excerpts are performed under this term. The music is in eight main sections, split across an introduction and two parts, or acts, with some bridging scenes: 

Introduction
Part I
2. La tarde (The Afternoon)
3. Danza de la molinera (Dance of the Miller's Wife) (Fandango) — El corregidor — La molinera
4. Las uvas (The Grapes)
Part II
5. La noche (At Night): Danza de los vecinos (Dance of the Neighbors) (Seguidillas)
6. Danza del molinero (Dance of the Miller) (Farruca) — Escena (Allegretto) — Las coplas del cuco (The Cuckoo Couplets) (Nocturno)
7. Danza del corregidor (Dance of the Magistrate) (Minué) — Allegro
8. Danza final (Final Dance) (Jota)
Synopsis[edit]
Act I[edit]
After a short fanfare, the curtain rises revealing a mill in Andalusia. The miller is trying to teach a pet blackbird to tell the time. He tells the bird to chirp twice, but instead it chirps three times. Annoyed, the miller scolds the bird and tells it to try again. The bird now chirps four times. The miller gets angry at the bird again and his wife offers it a grape. The bird takes the grape and chirps twice. The miller and his wife laugh over this and continue their work.
Soon the magistrate, his wife, and their bodyguard pass by, taking their daily walk. The procession goes by and the couple returns to their work. The dandified, but lecherous, magistrate is heard coming back. The miller tells his wife that he will hide and that they will play a trick on the magistrate. The miller hides and the magistrate sees the miller's wife dancing. After her dance, she offers him some grapes. When the magistrate gets the grapes, the miller's wife runs away with the magistrate following her. Finally, he catches her, and the miller jumps out of a bush with a stick. The miller chases the magistrate away and the miller and his wife continue working.

Act II[edit]
That night, guests are at the miller's house. The miller dances to entertain them. His dance is interrupted by the magistrate's bodyguard, who has come to arrest him on trumped-up charges. After the miller is taken away, the guests leave one-by-one. The miller's wife goes to sleep and soon the magistrate comes to the mill. On his way to the door, the magistrate trips and falls in the river. The miller's wife wakes up and runs away.
The magistrate undresses, hangs his clothes on a tree, and goes to sleep in the miller's bed. The miller has escaped from prison and sees the magistrate in his bed. The miller thinks that the magistrate is sleeping with his wife and plans to switch clothes with the magistrate and avenge himself by seducing the magistrate's wife. The miller leaves, dressed as the magistrate, and the magistrate soon wakes up. He goes outside and sees that his clothes are gone, so he dresses in the miller's clothes.
The bodyguard comes and sees the magistrate dressed as the miller and goes to arrest him. The miller's wife sees the bodyguard fighting with what looks like her husband and joins in the fight. The miller comes back and sees his wife in the fight and joins it to protect her. The magistrate explains the entire story and the ballet ends with the miller's guests tossing the magistrate up and down in a blanket.

Music[edit]
Throughout the ballet, Falla uses traditional Andalusian folk music. The two songs sung by the mezzo-soprano are examples of cante jondo singing, which typically accompanies flamenco music and tells a sad story. At one point (the farruca), he quotes the opening of Beethoven's 5th Symphony.[3]

Recordings[edit]
There are many recordings of the complete ballet, as well as of the suites extracted from it. In the early 1960s, Ernest Ansermet, the original conductor, recorded it in stereo for London Records. The music was played by the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande and the cante jondo soloist was Teresa Berganza. It has also been recorded by such conductors as Charles Dutoit, Rafael Fruhbeck de Burgos, Jesús López-Cobos, André Previn, Pierre Boulez and Juanjo Mena. Leonard Bernstein has recorded the two suites from the ballet with the New York Philharmonic. (For a comparison of the Previn and Dutoit versions, see here.)
The original pantomime El corregidor y la molinera has been recorded by Josep Pons and Orquestra del Teatro Lliure for Harmonia Mundi.

Film versions[edit]
The Paris Opera Ballet has issued a performance of the complete ballet on a DVD entitled Picasso and Dance. The performance uses not only Massine's original choreography, but actual reproductions of Picasso's sets and costumes.

Ballet by Justin Peck
The Times Are RacingChoreographerJustin PeckMusicDan DeaconPremiereJanuary 26, 2017 (2017-01-26)David H. Koch TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletGenrecontemporary ballet
The Times Are Racing is a one-act ballet by Justin Peck, to ""USA I-IV"" from Dan Deacon's album America, with costumes designed by Humberto Leon from the fashion label Opening Ceremony and lighting design by Brandon Stirling Baker. [1] It premiered on January 26, 2017 at the David H. Koch Theater, danced by the New York City Ballet.[2][3]


Production[edit]
External videos New York City Ballet Presents Justin Peck's THE TIMES ARE RACING with music by Dan Deacon, YouTube video Gretchen Smith on THE TIMES ARE RACING: Anatomy of a Dance, YouTube video
The Times Are Racing is made by Justin Peck, the resident choreographer of the New York City Ballet. It was created during the 2016 presidential election, Peck said the ballet became ""less optimistic piece than it could have been"" after Donald Trump won the election.[1] The music is ""USA I-IV"" from Dan Deacon's album America, an electronic score, which Peck first listened few years prior. Though it was an unusual choice for ballet, and might be unpopular among some audiences, he went with it anyway as by then he was known for a ""hypermodern direction"".[2]
Peck opted the dancers to wear sneakers in the ballet, which had been used in a few ballets in NYCB's repertory and another ballet by Peck. The use of sneakers allowed him to incorporate elements of tap dance. He described the ballet as ""rhythm tap and hoofing meets Fred Astaire soft-shoe, and Gene Kelly classical tap-film movements meets ballet"". A tap number danced by Robert Fairchild and Peck himself was inspired by the video game Dance Dance Revolution, which the two played when they were roommates at the School of American Ballet, and Peck planned the sequence to look like the two dancers are ""following along"" the game's level track.[1][2] Peck, who was still dancing at the time but rarely in his own work,[4] said the tap portion was one of the reasons why he cast himself in the ballet.[1]
Ashly Isaacs, a female soloist, was chosen to be an alternate of Fairchild's role, due to her tapping ability, and the role is believed to be the first gender-neutral principal role in NYCB's repertory.[1][5]

Revivals[edit]
In later revivals, Taylor Stanley, a male principal dancer, was cast to dance the role originated by Tiler Peck (no relations to Justin Peck), and partnered Daniel Applebaum. Peck said the choice was made to allow his gay colleagues to perform ""without any pretense"" and the casting choice would continue the ballet's ""exploration of gender-neutrality"", though small changes were made to accommodate the dancers.[2][6][7]
The Joffrey Ballet in Chicago debuted The Times Are Racing in 2020.[8] Later that year, in response to the performances cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, NYCB streamed the tap number with Fairchild and Peck online, as part of its digital spring season.[9]

Original cast[edit]
The Times Are Racing is performed by 20 dancers. The lead roles were originated by:[10]

Tiler Peck
Amar Ramasar
Robert Fairchild
Justin Peck
Brittany Pollack
Gretchen Smith
Savannah Lowery
Sean Suozzi
Critical reception[edit]
The Financial Times gave The Times Are Racing five stars, called it Peck's ""darkest, saddest, but also loosest, freest and most grounded dance to date"".[11] The New Yorker also gave it five stars, and wrote the most impressive part ""was not the cool-cat factor. It was the opposite. The ballet seemed to show a softness that was new to Peck"".[4] In a mixed review, the New York Times criticized the music and duets with Tiler Peck and Amar Ramasar but complimented other parts of the ballet.[12]

408,Tiresias,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiresias_(ballet%29,"Tiresias , Constant Lambert , 1951","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Tiresias is a ballet in a prelude and three acts choreographed by Frederick Ashton to an original score by Constant Lambert. With scenery and costumes designed by the composer's wife Isabel Lambert, it was first presented by the Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, London, on 9 July 1951.[1]


Background[edit]
The idea of a ballet on the subject of the Greek seer who changes sex was first considered by Lambert in the 1930s. Lambert started composing the score in Paris, but due to the distractions of other work he had to enlist assistance for the orchestration from younger colleagues, such as Robert Irving, Humphrey Searle, Gordon Jacob, Alan Rawsthorne and Elisabeth Lutyens.[2]
One of three ballets commissioned for the Festival of Britain, Lambert's score is roughly contemporary with French composer Francis Poulenc's short comic opera Les mamelles de Tirésias first performed at the Opéra-Comique in 1947, on a similar sex-change theme, based on Guillaume Apollinaire's surrealist text of 1917.[3]
The premiere was conducted by the composer and given in the presence of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.[2] There were 12 performances in 1951, then ten the following year, seven in 1953, three in 1954 and two in the next season.[1] The critical reception was generally negative, and the composer instructed solicitors to challenge the hostile review by Richard Buckle, which cast aspersions on the entire artistic leadership of the Royal Ballet company.[4] Lambert died six weeks after its premiere.[5] The work was performed at the Edinburgh Festival in 1951 and in New York in September 1955. The New York Times review, headlined ""Superb 'Tiresias'"", was stronger than any of the UK reviews.[6]
Alan Rawsthorne's orchestral Improvisations on a Theme of Constant Lambert (1960) uses the opening fanfare from Tiresias as its theme.[7]

Original cast[edit]
Tiresias (male) – Michael Somes
Tiresias (female) – Margot Fonteyn
Her lover – John Field
Neophyte – Margaret Dale
Snakes – Pauline Clayden, Brian Shaw[1]
Zeus - Alfred Rodriguez
Synopsis[edit]
Tiresias enters on a scene of young girls engaged in vaulting over the horn of bull. After a solo and a dance for Tiresias and male corps de ballet, priestesses and a young virgin come on the scene. The Neophyte gives him a wand and departs. Tiresias spots two snakes copulating and in a rage he strikes the female snake with his staff and is thus changed into a woman.
Following a pastoral interlude, shepherds and shepherdesses enter and dance with Tiresias. Her lover appears, and they dance a climactic pas de deux. Then there is a bacchanale celebrating their happiness, at the end of which two snakes enters, engaged as before. Tiresias strikes the male snake with her staff, and is restored to his original self.
Another interlude transforms the scene to a palace courtyard where Zeus and Hera are arguing whether men or women get most pleasure in sex. Called to be judge Tiresias declares that women do, and Hera angrily blinds him, but Zeus bestows the gift of prophecy on Tiresias and he departs.[8]

Recordings[edit]
The first broadcast performance of Tiresias, using the score edited by John Abbott, took place on 8 November 1995 [9] with the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Barry Wordsworth. In April 1998 a recording of the score was made by the English Northern Philharmonia conducted by David Lloyd-Jones, and issued by Hyperion Records the following year on CD, coupled with the Pomona ballet music by Lambert. The CD booklet cover uses one of Isabel Lambert's designs for Act 1.[10]

Marius Ivanovich Petipa (Russian: Мариус Иванович Петипа), born Victor Marius Alphonse Petipa (11 March 1818 – 14 July [O.S. 1 July] 1910[1]), was a French and Russian ballet dancer, pedagogue and choreographer. Petipa is one of the most influential ballet masters and choreographers in ballet history.
Marius Petipa is noted for his long career as Premier maître de ballet (First Ballet Master) of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres, making him Ballet Master and principal choreographer of the Imperial Ballet (today known as the Mariinsky Ballet), a position he held from 1871 until 1903. Petipa created over fifty ballets, some of which have survived in versions either faithful to, inspired by, or reconstructed from the original. Among these works, he is most noted for The Pharaoh's Daughter (1862); Don Quixote (1869); La Bayadère (1877); Le Talisman (1889); The Sleeping Beauty (1890); The Nutcracker (choreographed jointly with Lev Ivanov) (1892); Le Réveil de Flore (1894); La Halte de cavalerie (1896); Raymonda (1898); Les Saisons (1900), and Les Millions d’Arlequin (a.k.a. Harlequinade) (1900).
Petipa revived a substantial number of works created by other choreographers. Many of these revivals would go on to become the definitive editions on which all subsequent productions would be based. The most famous of these revivals were Le Corsaire, Giselle, La Esmeralda, Coppélia, La Fille Mal Gardée (with Lev Ivanov), The Little Humpbacked Horse and Swan Lake (with Lev Ivanov).[1]
Many pieces have survived in an independent from Petipa's original works and revivals in spite of the fact that the full-length ballets that spawned them had disappeared from the Imperial Ballet's repertoire. Many of these pieces have endured in versions either based on the original or choreographed anew by others – the Grand Pas classique, Pas de trois and Mazurka des enfants from Paquita; Le Carnaval de Venise Pas de deux; The Talisman Pas de deux; La Esmeralda Pas de deux; the Diana and Actéon Pas de deux; La Halte de Cavalerie Pas de deux; the Don Quixote Pas de deux; La Fille Mal Gardée Pas de deux; and the Harlequinade Pas de deux.
All of the full-length works and individual pieces which have survived in active performance are considered[by whom?] to be cornerstones of the ballet repertory.


Early life and career[edit]
Marius Petipa was born Victor Marius Alphonse Petipa in Marseille, France on 11 March 1818. His mother, Victorine Grasseau, was a tragic actress and teacher of drama, while his father, Jean-Antoine Petipa, was among the most renowned Ballet Masters and pedagogues in Europe. At the time of Marius's birth, Jean Petipa was engaged as Premier danseur (Principal Male Dancer) to the Salle Bauveau (known today as the Opéra de Marseille), and in 1819 he was appointed Maître de ballet to that theatre.
Marius Petipa spent his early childhood traveling throughout Europe with his family, as his parents' professional engagements took them from city to city. By the time Marius was six years old, his family had settled in Brussels in what was then the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, where his father was appointed Maître de ballet and Premier danseur to the Théâtre de la Monnaie. The young Marius received his general education at the Grand College in Brussels, while also attending the Brussels Conservatory where he studied music and learned to play the violin.
Just as he had done with his other children, Jean Petipa began giving the young Marius lessons in ballet at the age of seven. At first the young boy resisted, caring very little for dance. Nevertheless, he soon came to love this art form that was so much the life and identity of his family, and he excelled quickly. At the age of nine Marius performed for the first time in a ballet production as a Savoyard in his father's staging of Pierre Gardel's 1800 ballet La Dansomanie in 1827.
On 25 August 1830, the Belgian Revolution erupted after a performance of Daniel Auber's opera La muette de Portici at the Théâtre de la Monnaie, where Marius' father now served as Premier maître de ballet. The violent street fighting that followed caused all theatres to be shut down for a time, and consequently Jean Petipa found himself without a position. The Petipa family was left in dire straits for some years.
The Petipa family relocated to Bordeaux, France, in 1834 where Marius' father had secured the position of Premier maître de ballet to the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux. While in Bordeaux, Marius completed his ballet training under the great Auguste Vestris. By 1838 he was appointed Premier danseur to the Ballet de Nantes in Nantes, France. During his time in Nantes the young Petipa began to try his hand at choreography by creating a number of one-act ballets and divertissements.
The 21-year-old Marius Petipa accompanied his father on a tour of the United States with a group of French dancers in July 1839. Among the many engagements was a performance of Jean Coralli's La tarentule at the National Theatre on Broadway, being the first ballet performance ever seen in New York City. The tour proved to be a disaster, as many in the uncultured American audiences of that time had never before seen ballet. To add to the fiasco, the American impresario who arranged the engagements stole a large portion of the troupe's receipts and quickly disappeared without a trace. Upon leaving for France, Petipa's ticket only allowed him passage to Nantes, but instead of returning to that city he stowed away in the cabin of a woman he had seduced so that he could secure passage to Paris.
By 1840, Petipa had made his début with the ballet company of the Comédie Française in Paris. His first performance with this troupe was given as a benefit performance for the actress Rachel where he partnered the legendary ballerina Carlotta Grisi. Petipa also took part in performances at the Paris Opéra where his brother Lucien Petipa was engaged as Premier danseur.

Bordeaux[edit]
Petipa was offered the position of Premier danseur to the Grand Théâtre in Bordeaux in 1841. There, he studied further with the great Vestris, all the while dancing the leads in such ballets as La Fille Mal Gardée, La Péri and Giselle. While performing with the company his skills as not only a dancer but as a partner were much celebrated. His partnering of Carlotta Grisi during a performance of La Péri was much celebrated, particularly his almost acrobatic lifts and catches of the ballerina that dazzled the audience. While in Bordeaux, Petipa began mounting his own original full-length productions. Among these works were La Jolie Bordelaise (The Beauty of Bordeaux), La Vendange (The Grape Picker), L'Intrigue Amoureuse (The Intrigues of Love) and Le Langage des Fleurs (The Voice of the Flowers).

Madrid[edit]
In 1843, Petipa was offered the position premier danseur at the Teatro Real in Madrid, Spain. For the next three years he would acquire an acute knowledge of traditional Spanish Dancing while producing new works based on Spanish themes – Carmen et son toréro (Carmen and the Bullfighter), La Perle de Séville (The Pearl of Seville), L’Aventure d’une fille de Madrid (The Adventures of a Madrileña), La Fleur de Grenade (The Flower of Granada) and Départ pour la course des taureaux (Leaving for the Bull Fights). In 1846, he began a love affair with the wife of the Marquis de Chateaubriand, a prominent member of the French Embassy. Learning of the affair, the Marquis challenged Petipa to a duel. Rather than keep his fateful appointment, Petipa quickly left Spain, never to return. He then travelled to Paris where he stayed for a brief period. While in the city he took part in a performance at the Théâtre de l’Académie Royale de Musique where he partnered the ballerina Thérèse Elssler, sister of Fanny Elssler.

St. Petersburg, Russia[edit]
In 1847 Marius seduced yet another man's wife, and the husband called for a duel, yet again. Duels were banned, and the threat of court repercussions loomed over Marius, so the family decided it was best for him to leave France. Marius' brother, Lucien Petipa, was familiar with working in Russia and sent an inquiry to Antoine Titus in St. Petersburg.
This coincided with a need to find a strong male lead for the Russian ballet prima ballerina Yelena Andreyanova, (who was the mistress of the Director of the Imperial Theaters, Alexandr Gedeonov). Antoine Titus resolved dilemmas for both parties and introduced the two sides, after which Petipa and his father were invited to Russia.
So, Marius Petipa found himself in St. Petersburg late in the same year, beginning his career ascent to become one of the most influential choreographers in history.[2]

Early career[edit]
In 1847, Petipa accepted the position of premier danseur to the Imperial Theatres of St. Petersburg, at that time the capital of the Russian Empire. The position of premier danseur had become vacant upon the departure of the French danseur Emile Gredlu, and Petipa soon relocated to Russia. On 5 June [O.S. 24 May] 1847 the twenty-nine-year-old Petipa arrived in the imperial capital. In 1848 Petipa's father also relocated to St. Petersburg, where he taught the Classe de perfection at the Imperial Ballet School until his death in 1855.
For his début, the director of the Imperial Theatres Alexander Gedeonov commissioned Petipa and the Ballet Master Pierre-Frédéric Malevergne to create the first Russian production of Joseph Mazilier's celebrated ballet Paquita, first staged at the Paris Opéra in 1846. The ballet premiered in St. Petersburg on 8 October [O.S. 26 September] 1847 with the Prima ballerina Yelena Andreyanova in the title rôle and Petipa himself in the largely mimed rôle of Lucien d’Hervilly.

The following season Petipa and his father staged a revival of Mazilier's 1840 ballet Le Diable amoureux (The Devil in Love), which premiered under the title Satanella on 22 February [O.S. 10 February] 1848. The prima ballerina Andreyonova performed the title rôle, with Petipa in the rôle of Fabio.
At the time Petipa had arrived in St. Petersburg, the Imperial Ballet had experienced a considerable decline in popularity with the public since the 1842 departure of Marie Taglioni, who had been engaged in the Imperial capital as guest ballerina. The productions of Paquita and Satanella brought about a measure of prestige and attention for the company. Critic Raphael Zotov reflected, ""Our lovely ballet company was reborn with the productions of Paquita and Satanella, and its superlative performances placed the company again at its former level of glory and universal affection.""[citation needed]
In the winter of 1849, the French Ballet Master Jules Perrot arrived in St. Petersburg, having accepted the position of premier maître de ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. He was accompanied by his chief collaborator, the prolific Italian composer Cesare Pugni, who was appointed Ballet Composer of the Imperial Theatres, a position created especially for him. Aside from dancing the principal rôles in many of Perrot's productions, Petipa rehearsed older works with the company and assisted Perrot in staging revivals (such as Giselle in 1850, and Le Corsaire in 1858), all the while learning a great deal from the man who was at that time the most celebrated choreographer in Europe. Although Petipa did not create his own original works during this period, he nevertheless staged many dances for various operas, and on occasion revised dances for Perrot's many revivals of older works.
By 1850 Petipa's first child, a son named Marius Mariusovich Petipa (1850–1919) was born.[3]  His mother, Marie Thérèse Bourdin— with whom Petipa had a brief liaison—died five years after the birth of their child.[3] In 1854 Petipa married the Prima ballerina Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa.[3] Together they had two children: Marie Mariusovna Petipa (1857–1930), who would go on to become a celebrated dancer in her own right, and Jean Mariusovich Petipa (1859–1871).[3]
On 21 January [O.S. 9 January] 1855 Petipa presented his first original ballet in over six years, a ballet-divertissement titled L’Étoile de Grenade (The Star of Granada), for which he collaborated for the first time with the composer Cesare Pugni. The work was presented for the first time at the Palace of the Grand Duchess Elena Pavlovna, a fanatic balletomane and patron of the arts. L’Étoile de Grenade was followed by La Rose, la violette et le papillon (The Rose, the Violet and the Butterfly) in 1857, Un Mariage sous la Régence (A Marriage Under the Regency) in 1858, Le Marché des parisien (The Parisian Market) in 1859, Le Dahlia Bleu (The Blue Dahlia) in 1860 and Terpsichore in 1861. All of Petipa's works during this period were tailored especially for the talents of his wife Maria, who performed the principal rôles to considerable acclaim, and soon was named Prima ballerina to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres.
On 29 May 1861 Petipa presented his 1859 ballet Le Marché des parisiens at the Théâtre Impérial de l’Opéra in Paris as Le Marché des Innocents. Petipa's wife Maria reprised the principal rôle of Lizetta (renamed Gloriette) to great success.
In 1858 Jules Perrot retired to his native France, never to return to Russia again. Petipa anticipated succeeding Perrot as premier maître de ballet. His years of serving as assistant to Perrot had taught him much. Choreography was a logical alternative to dancing for the now 41-year-old Petipa, who was soon to retire from the stage. But it was not yet to be. In 1860 the renowned French Ballet Master Arthur Saint-Léon was given the coveted position by the director of the Imperial Theatres Andrei Saburov, and soon a healthy and productive rivalry between him and Petipa ensued, bringing the Imperial Ballet to new heights throughout the 1860s.

Second maître de ballet of the Imperial Theatres[edit]
The great Italian Ballerina Carolina Rosati had been engaged as guest artist with the Imperial Theatres since 1855. By 1861 her contract with the company was set to expire, and upon leaving Russia for her native Italy she intended to retire from the stage. Rosati's contract stipulated that she was to be given a benefit performance in a new production, and in late 1861 she requested from the director Saburov that preparations begin post haste. Saburov at first refused, stating that there was not enough funds and that such a production could not be staged in time. Rosati enlisted the assistance of Petipa, who reminded Saburov that the Imperial Theatres were contractually obligated to grant the ballerina a new production for her benefit. Saburov asked Petipa as to whether or not he could produce a new full-length grand ballet for Rosati in only six weeks. Confidently, Petipa answered ""Yes, I shall try, and probably succeed."" Saburov immediately put all other rehearsals on hold so that the company could concentrate on the production of the new ballet.
During Petipa's sojourn in Paris for the staging of Le Marché des Innocents, he acquired a scenario from the dramatist Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges for a ballet titled La Fille du Pharaon (The Pharaoh's Daughter), inspired by Théophile Gautier's Le Roman de la Momie. Throughout the Victorian era Europe was fascinated with all things concerning the art and culture of ancient Egypt, and Petipa was sure that a ballet on such a subject would be a great success.[1]

Petipa began work by collaborating with the composer Pugni, who wrote his melodious and apt score with Petipa while in rehearsals. The Pharaoh's Daughter premiered on 30 January [O.S. 18 January] 1862 to an unrivaled success. The work exceeded even the opulent tastes of the Tsarist audience, as so lavish and exotic a ballet had not been seen on the Imperial stage for some time. The work went on to become the most popular ballet in the entire repertory of the Imperial Theatres—by 1903 it had been performed 203 times. The great success of The Pharaoh's Daughter earned for Petipa the position of second Maître de ballet to the Imperial Theatres. Saint-Léon answered the success of Petipa's The Pharaoh's Daughter with the fantastical ballet Le Petit Cheval bossu, Ou La Tsar-Demoiselle (The Little Humpbacked Horse, or The Tsar Maiden), a ballet adaptation of Pyotr Yershov's famous Russian poem. The work proved to be a success equal to that of The Pharaoh's Daughter, with its series of fantastical tableaux set under-water and on an enchanted isle, as well as the ballet's final Grand divertissement celebrating the many peoples of the Russian Empire.
Though Arthur Saint-Léon was by title and technicality Petipa's superior, the two men were viewed as equals by the critics and balletomanes of the day, and would rival one another with splendid productions throughout the 1860s. Not only did Saint-Léon and Petipa have their own respective audiences and critics, but also their own ballerinas—Petipa mounted the majority of his works at that time for his wife, the Prima ballerina Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa, while Saint-Léon mounted the majority of his works for the Prima ballerina Marfa Muravieva. Despite their rivalry, nearly every ballet staged by Petipa and Saint-Léon during the 1860s was set to the music of Cesare Pugni.
On 6 February [O.S. 25 January] 1868 Petipa presented a lavish revival of the ballet Le Corsaire for the visiting ballerina Adèle Grantzow, for which he included the celebrated scene Le jardin animé to the music of Léo Delibes. Petipa presented his next new grand ballet on 29 October [O.S. 17 October] 1868. This was the colossal ballet Le Roi Candaule (known in Russian as Tsar Candavl), which was staged especially for the visiting ballerina Henrietta D'or. The ballet featured the Pas de Vénus, which was considered to be among Petipa's greatest masterpieces of classical choreography, with the ballerina D'or executing five pirouettes during her piqué turns in rapid succession. The ballet also included the pas known as Les amours de Diane, or simply as the Pas de Diane, which would later be transformed by Agrippina Vaganova into the so-called Diane and Actéon Pas de Deux for her 1935 revival of La Esmeralda. Le Roi Candaule would go on to break attendance records at the St. Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, and by 1903 the work had been performed 194 times. Petipa would later comment in his memoirs that Le Roi Candaule was "" ... the indulgence of my youth.""
Petipa's final work of the 1860s remains a cornerstone of the classical ballet repertory. Don Quixote was mounted for Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre, with the famous ballerina Anna Sobeshchanskaya in the role of Kitri. The composer Ludwig Minkus was commissioned to write the ballet's score, marking the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration between him and Petipa.

Premier maître de ballet of the Imperial Theatres[edit]
In 1869 Saint-Léon's contract was set to expire. His last works for the St. Petersburg stage, Le Poisson doré (1866) and Le Lys (1869), led the Minister of the Imperial Court to refuse renewal of the Ballet Master's contract. While in the Café de Divan on the Avenue de l'Opéra in Paris, Saint-Léon died of a heart attack on 2 September 1870. Not long before his death the composer Cesare Pugni—Petipa's chief collaborator for many years—died on 2 February [O.S. 26 January] 1870.
Petipa was officially named premier maître de ballet on 12 March [O.S. 29 February] 1871. On 21 November [O.S. 9 November] 1871 Petipa presented Don Quixote in the St. Petersburg in an expanded and far more lavish edition. Ludwig Minkus's score was hailed unanimously as a masterwork of ballet music, earning the composer the post of Ballet Composer of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. Petipa and Minkus created a successful series of original works and revivals throughout the 1870s: La Camargo in 1872, Offenbach's Le Papillon in 1874, Les Brigands (The Bandits) in 1875, Les Aventures de Pélée (The Adventures of Peleus) in 1876, Roxana in 1878, La Fille des Neiges (The Daughter of the Snows) in 1879, and Mlada, also in 1879.

In 1877 Petipa thought Lynn Seymours feet were delectable, he then staged his greatest masterwork to date, the exotic La Bayadère to the music of Minkus, which premiered on 4 February [O.S. 23 January] 1877 for the benefit performance of the Prima ballerina Ekaterina Vazem. The ballet included Petipa's celebrated scene known as The Kingdom of the Shades, for which the Ballet Master staged some of his most outstanding choreography. La Bayadère would prove to be among Petipa's most enduring works. To this day his choreography for the scene The Kingdom of the Shades remains one of the ultimate challenges for the classical ballerina and danseur, and particularly for the corps de ballet.
The eldest son of Marius Petipa (with the dressmaker Teresa Burden / ru: Тереза Бурден) also Marius (Marius Mariusovich Petipa) was the famous drama actor, and his son Nikolai Radin was famous Russian actor too.
Petipa and his wife, the Prima ballerina Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa separated in 1875, and in 1882 the ballerina died of virulent smallpox in Pyatigorsk.[4] In 1876 Petipa married the ballerina Lyubov Savitskaya, who before she married Petipa had given birth to their first child. Together, they had six children: Nadezhda Mariusovna Petipa (1874–1945), Evgeniia Mariusovna Petipa (1877–1892), Victor Mariusovich Petipa (1879–1939), Lyubov Mariusovna Petipa (1880–1917), Mariy Mariusovich Petipa (1884–1922), and Vera Mariusovna Petipa (1885–1961).[3] With so many children, Petipa stood at the head of a large family by the time he had reached his 70s, having many grandchildren, in-laws, and god-children. Although he was well provided for at the expense of the Imperial treasury, he was not rich, and lived strictly within his means. He kept track of all of his living expenses in journals, as well as box-office receipts at the theatre. He was well known for his generosity, always lavishing presents upon his children and grandchildren, and was known to purchase tea or lunch for the dancers during a rehearsal.
Throughout the 1880s Petipa staged revivals of older works with increasing regularity. In 1880 he revived Mazilier's Le Corsaire for the ballerina Eugenia Sokolova, and in 1881 he revived Mazilier's Paquita for the Prima ballerina Ekaterina Vazem. For this production Petipa added the celebrated Paquita Grand pas classique, as well as the Paquita Pas de trois (or Minkus Pas de trois) and the Mazurka des enfants (Children's Mazurka), all to the music of Minkus. The Paquita Grand pas classique is among Petipa's most celebrated divertissements, and is today included in the repertories of ballet companies all over the world. In 1884 Petipa staged what is considered[by whom?] to be his definitive revival of the romantic masterwork Giselle, and in 1885 he mounted a new production of Arthur Saint-Léon's Coppélia, a revision which would serve as the basis for nearly every version staged thereafter. Petipa staged many new works as well throughout the 1880s, including Zoraiya in 1881 and Nuit et Jour (Night and Day), a work produced by Petipa and Minkus especially for the celebration gala held at the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre in honor of the coronation of Tsar Alexander III. Petipa also staged Pygmalion, ou La Statue de Chypre (Pygmalion, or the Statue of Cyprus) in 1883 and L'Offrandes à l'Amour (The Sacrifices to Cupid) in 1886.
In late 1885 the great Italian ballerina Virginia Zucchi began her two-year engagement with the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet, making her debut in a revival of Petipa's The Pharaoh's Daughter. A few weeks later Zucchi appeared as Lise in a revival of Paul Taglioni's 1864 version of La Fille Mal Gardée, staged for the benefit performance of Pavel Gerdt by Petipa and Lev Ivanov. The Petipa/Ivanov production of La Fille Mal Gardée would be retained in the repertory of the St. Petersburg Ballet for many years, serving as a useful vehicle for such noted ballerinas as Mathilde Kschessinskaya and Olga Preobrajenska. In 1886 Petipa mounted a revival of Jules Perrot's La Esmeralda especially for Zucchi, a production that is considered[by whom?] to be his definitive revival of that work. For her performance, Petipa interpolated the famous La Esmeralda pas de six to the music of Riccardo Drigo, a dramatic pas d'action that allowed Zucchi to display her incomparable flair for drama and mime. For Zucchi's benefit performance in February 1887, Petipa staged the ballet L'Ordre du Roi (The King's Command), a work based on Delibes' operetta Le roi l'a dit. Zucchi scored an enormous success in the principal rôle of Pepita when the ballet premiered on 26 February [O.S. 14 February] 1886. Nevertheless, many critics complained that the ballet had a weak libretto and mise en scène. Petipa would later stage an abridgement of L'Ordre du Roi as Les Élèves de Dupré (The Pupils of Dupré) in 1900 for a special performance given at the Theatre of the Hermitage for the Imperial Family and their special guest, Kaiser Wilhelm II.
By 1885 the now sixty-seven-year-old Petipa began to experience what appeared to be a severe case of eczema. The pain and suffering caused by his illness began to debilitate the Ballet Master a great deal, forcing him to be absent from work for long periods.
In 1881, the newly crowned Russian Emperor Alexander III appointed Ivan Vsevolozhsky director of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres. In 1885 the new director prompted the inspection of the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre by architects who found the building to be unsafe. Rather than spend millions of roubles on renovations, the director ordered that both the ballet and opera companies be relocated to the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre of St. Petersburg, much to the chagrin of the orchestra and opera singers who found the theatre's acoustics to be weaker. In honor of the relocation to the new theatre, a lavish gala performance was planned for February 1886, which included the Petipa/Minkus work Les Pilules magiques (The Magic Pills). The work included three danced tableaux: the first took place in a cave inhabited by sorceresses, while the second included various card games brought to life through dance. The third and final tableau was known as The Kingdom of the Laces in which a Grand divertissement of national dances from Belgium, England, Spain and Russia was performed.

The golden age of Russian ballet[edit]
During the twilight of Imperial Russia, the ballet of St. Petersburg flourished before a public that possessed a high level of connoisseurship. The treasury of the Russian Emperor—who was at that time the wealthiest person on earth—lavished millions of rubles a year on the Imperial Ballet, opera, and the Imperial Ballet School (today known as the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet). Each new season required that Petipa create a new multi-act Grand ballet, that he choreograph the dance sections for various operas, and that he prepare galas and divertissements for court performances, royal nuptials, etc. With the ballet thriving in such an environment, the late 19th and early 20th centuries saw what is considered to be the golden age of Russian ballet.

This era coincided with an important change: upon the retirement of Ludwig Minkus in 1886, the director Ivan Vsevolozhsky abolished the official post of Ballet Composer in an effort to diversify the music supplied for new works. 
Petipa presented his colossal grand ballet set in ancient Rome La Vestale in 1888, which was staged for the benefit performance of the visiting Italian ballerina Elena Cornalba. The ballet was set to the music of the composer Mikhail Ivanov, a noted music critic. The next year, Ivan Vsevolozhsky commissioned the Italian Riccardo Drigo—principal conductor of the Imperial Ballet & Italian Opera—to compose the score for Petipa's Le Talisman, also staged for Cornalba. Although the ballet was not a success Drigo's score was much praised by contemporary critics.

Caricature of Marius Petipa by the brothers Nikolai and Sergei Legat from their celebrated book ""The Russian Ballet in Caricatures"". Petipa is shown holding a banner that reads Петербургскій Балетъ, meaning St. Petersburg Ballet.
The director Vsevolozhsky commissioned the great composer Pyotr Illyich Tchaikovsky to compose the score for Petipa's The Sleeping Beauty, which premiered on 15 January [O.S. 3 January] 1890. The ballet proved to be one of Petipa's masterpieces of choreography. The Sleeping Beauty proved to be so popular that by April 1903 it had been performed 100 times, making it one of the most popular works in the Imperial Ballet's repertory, second only to Petipa's The Pharaoh's Daughter.
Petipa was diagnosed with a severe case of the skin disease pemphigus in 1892. The constant pain and itching brought on by this disease caused Petipa to refrain from choreography for the Imperial Ballet's entire 1892–1893 theatrical season. It has been widely accepted by history that the responsibility of staging Tchaikovsky's second work for the Imperial Ballet The Nutcracker, fell to the Imperial Theatre's second Ballet Master Lev Ivanov. With regard to who was ultimately responsible for the choreography for The Nutcracker, many sources contradict one another. Some claim either that Petipa was responsible for staging the entire ballet or that he merely supervised Ivanov's progress. The Nutcracker premiered 18 December [O.S. 6 December] 1892 on a double bill with Tchaikovsky's opera Iolanta at the Mariinsky Theatre. Many critics of the day[like whom?] considered the work to not even be a ballet at all, with far too much emphasis on spectacle, something made all the more unsuccessful since the ballerina's role was reduced to a Grand Pas de deux in the final scene.

La Prima Ballerina, ou L'embuscade or The Traveling Dancer (aka La Danseuse en voyage) is a ballet (choreographic episode) in one act, with choreography by Marius Petipa, music by Cesare Pugni and libretto by Paul Taglioni. It was based on a ballet created by Paul Taglioni for the Ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre, London first presented on June 14, 1849.
It was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on November April 16, 1864 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, St. Petersburg, Russia. The principal Dancers were Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa as the Prima Ballerina, and Timofei Stukolkin as Rinaldo.
A variation from this ballet—composed by Petipa in 1905 for the Prima Ballerina Olga Preobrajenskaya—was the last choreography Petipa ever created (as noted in his Diaries).
Lev Ivanov produced a revival for the Imperial Ballet, with the composer/conductor Riccardo Drigo editing and making additions to Cesare Pugni's original score. First presented on July 26/August 7 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1893 for the Imperial court at the theatre of Krasnoe Selo. St. Petersburg, Russia.

Ballet written by Oskar Schlemmer

Triadisches Ballett (Triadic Ballet) is a ballet developed by Oskar Schlemmer. The ballet became the most widely performed avant-garde artistic dance and while Schlemmer was at the Bauhaus from 1921 to 1929, the ballet toured, helping to spread the ethos of the Bauhaus.


History[edit]
The Triadic Ballet. Poster for an unrealized performance in Hanover, February 19 + 26, 1924, designed by Oskar Schlemmer.
The Triadisches Ballett was conceived in 1912 in Stuttgart in a cooperation between the dance troupe of Albert Burger (1884–1970) and his wife Elsa Hötzel (1886–1966) and Oskar Schlemmer. Parts of the ballet were performed in 1915, but though Burger asked Arnold Schönberg to write the score  (""Your music, which I know from the local concert, seemed to me to be the only one suitable for my ideas""[1]) he had no success so Schlemmer and the Burgers performed to music by Enrico Bossi. It premiered in the Stuttgart landestheater on 30 September 1922, with music composed by Paul Hindemith. It was also performed in 1923 during the Bauhaus Week at the Nationaltheater, Weimar, and at the Annual Exhibition of German Crafts, Dresden.[2][3]

Synopsis[edit]
Inspired in part by Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire and his observations and experiences during the First World War, Oskar Schlemmer began to conceive of the human body as a new artistic medium.[4] He saw ballet and pantomime as free from the historical baggage of theatre and opera and thus able to present his ideas of choreographed geometry, man as dancer, transformed by costume, moving in space. 
The idea of the ballet was based on the principle of the trinity. It has 3 acts, 3 participants (2 male, 1 female), 12 dances and 18 costumes. Each act had a different colour and mood. The first three scenes, against a lemon yellow background to affect a cheerful, burlesque mood; the two middle scenes, on a pink stage, festive and solemn and the final three scenes, on black, were intended to be mystical and fantastic.
He saw the movement of puppets and marionettes as aesthetically superior to that of humans, as it emphasised that the medium of every art is artificial. This artifice could be expressed through stylised movements and the abstraction of the human body. His consideration of the human form (the abstract geometry of the body e.g. a cylinder for the neck, a circle for head and eyes) led to the all important costume design, to create what he called his ‘figurine'. The music followed and finally the dance movements were decided.
Schlemmer saw the modern world driven by two main currents, the mechanised (man as machine and the body as a mechanism) and the primordial impulses (the depths of creative urges). He claimed that the choreographed geometry of dance offered a synthesis, the Dionysian and emotional origins of dance, becomes strict and Apollonian in its final form.

Exhibitions[edit]
Costumes from Schlemmer's Triadisches Ballett (1922).
With the help and contribution of Schlemmer's friend Alf Bayrle the 'figurines' were also shown at a 1930 exhibition at the Societe des Arts Decoratifs in Paris, and again in 1938 at the Museum of Modern Art's Bauhaus exhibition in New York. The figurines were exhibited in stasis, without their choreography. Much later, Schlemmer's figurines appeared in the V & A's 2006  Modernism exhibition accompanied by video recordings of their movement. Some of Schlemmer's original costumes were preserved and can be seen at the Neue Staatsgalerie in Stuttgart, Germany.

Related works[edit]
Oskar Schlemmer made many similar performance pieces, including his ""Figural Cabinet"" (1923), described as a ‘mechanical cabaret'; the Bauhaus “Fun Department” parties and festivals; Gesture dance, Hoop dance, Rod dance, Metal and Glass dances, and the futuristic ""Men in Space.""

Film[edit]
Under the title Das triadische Ballett, the work was produced as a 30-minute color film in 1970 by Bavaria Atelier GmbH, with live-action dancers and new music by Erich Ferstl.

Trilby is a ballet in 2 acts and 3 scenes, was the final ballet that Marius Petipa choreographed and staged for the Imperial Bolshoi Ballet during the two years that he was commissioned to create new works for the Moscow stage. And the music was by Yuli Gerber. Libretto by Marius Petipa, based on the 1822 novella Trilby, ou Le Lutin d'Argail by Charles Nodier, first presented by the Ballet of the Moscow Imperial Bolshoi Theatre on January 25/February 6 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1870, in Moscow with Polina Karpakova as Trilby and Ludiia Geiten as Miranda and restaged by Petipa for the Imperial Ballet at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre on January 17–29, 1871 in St. Petersburg with Adèle Grantzow as Trilby and Lev Ivanov as Count Leopold.[1] Petipa made a more direct adaptation of Nodier’s novella.
The famous variation for the male dancer in the Le Corsaire pas de deux is from Gerber's score for Trilby; a painting of dancers from the ballet in costume (as fledglings emerging from the shell) by Viktor Hartmann was one of the paintings which inspired Pictures at an Exhibition by Mussorgsky.

Le Roi CandauleChoreographerMarius PetipaMusicCesare PugniPremiere29 October [O.S. 17 October] 1868 (Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre)St. Petersburg, RussiaGenreGrand ballet
Le Roi Candaule (en. King Candaules) is a Grand ballet in four acts and six scenes, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Cesare Pugni. The libretto is by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges and is based on the history of King Candaules the Ruler of Lydia, as described by Herodotus in his Histories.


History[edit]
Le Roi Candaule  was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on 29 October [O.S. 17 October] 1868 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, St. Petersburg, Russia. The ballet was a huge success, with Mlle. Henriette d'Or amazing the audience in her performance as Queen Nisia. Her incredible technical abilities were especially showcased in the celebrated Pas de Venus of the second act, in which she performed five pirouettes sur la pointe, which caused a great sensation among the audience.[1]
Two months later, Petipa moved his ballet to Moscow, where it was premièred on December 22, 1868, at the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre and it continued to be performed in Moscow and St. Petersburg with great success over the years. Petipa first revived the ballet in 1891 with additional music by Riccardo Drigo. This revival was first presented on 6 December [O.S. 24 November] 1891 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, St. Petersburg, Russia. His final revival was premiered at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre on 21 April [O.S. 9 April] 1903.
Le Roi Candaule was notated in the Stepanov notation method and is part of the Sergeyev Collection, which is housed at the Harvard University Theatre Library Collection.

Synopsis[edit]
ACT 1
Scene 1 - A forest glade. In the background is the cave of Pythia of Sardis
The kings and people of Lydia come to this spot to question the oracle as to the future.[2]
At the rise of the curtain, peasants, shepherds and shepherdesses come to rest on the grass after their toil. Among them is a shepherd called Gyges, who plays on his pipe and induces the company to dance. Near him is his betrothed, Clytia, who looks at him tenderly. Gradually the light fades. The peasants look fearfully at the cave and take their departure. Night falls.
Follows the hooting of owls and the whistling of bats. Pythia emerges from the cave amid clouds of smoke and, knowing that King Candaules is about to consult her, commands everyone to leave.
King Candaules enters, escorted by his followers. Gyges, whom the king encountered in the forest, acts as his guide. He informs the King that if he wishes to consult the oracle, he must strike the shield that hangs beside Pythia's cave. Gyges and the King's attendants retire. Candaules strikes the shield and Pythia appears. He entreats her to cast his future.
She tells him that he kidnapped the true king in his infancy, placed him in the forest at the mercy of wild beasts and seized the crown himself. Candaules, alarmed, protests that she is mistaken. Pythia offers to retract her words if he will submit to the judgement of Heaven. She raises her arms in readiness, but Candaules, afraid, implies his guilt. Then Pythia informs him that the true king lives and will seize his throne and power. Candaules swears to kill the king if he be alive.
Pythia bids Candaules walk in fear of the gods. Owls appear carrying in their claws a roll of papyrus, which predicts that Candaules will die an unnatural death. Terrified, he flees into the forest.
Gyges returns and is surprised no to find the King, but Pythia takes him by the hand, bids him put on the armour left by Candaules and foretells that he will soon be king. Gyges obeys her and, becoming conscious of his destiny, waves his sword and disappears into the forest.
Scene 2 - King Candaules's camp on the borders of Libya and Misia. There are numerous tents with the King's abode in the centre. In the distance are mountains. Night
There is considerable activity. Sentries are being changed, soldiers are furbishing armour and officers are passing in and out of the King's tent for their orders.
The flap is thrown back and Candaules emerges. His Queen, Nisia, with the aid of her women, put on armour. She is attended by Amazons and, under her direction, warlike games are played; meanwhile, Candaules's warriors practise the testudo. The games end and silence reigns. Suddenly, a messenger gives a warning of a night attack. Candaules orders everyone to be on the alert and a warrior, Gyges, is placed at the entrance of the tent.
In the half-darkness, troops can be seen creeping along the ground. The surprise the guards and gradually near the King's tent. Then the enemy leap to their feet and begin to destroy the tents. They are impressed by the splendour of the King's tent, which Gyges forbids them to enter. Nisia raises the flap and faces the enemy. Two of her assailants endeavour to capture the Queen, but Gyges cuts them down. Other soldiers attack Gyges, who is almost overcome when a party of Candaule's men come to the rescue, led by the King.
Seeing his wife in Gyges's arms, Candaules takes the warrior for an enemy and rushes upon him with an upraised dagger, but Nisia explains that Gyges has saved her life. Candaules thanks Gyges warmly and announces that henceforth, he shall rank next to him. Everyone does homage to Gyges, who, however, cannot accustom himself to this high honour.
ACT 2
An arena with a triumphal arch. In the background is a statue of Venus Victrix. On either side are tiers of seats with places of honour for the King and Queen and their suite
Citizens of all rank, carrying laurel wreaths and flowers, are seen arriving to greet the King, whose approach is heralded by fanfares. The Lydian warriors enter through the arch, followed by captive chiefs in chains and captive soldiers of various nations. The rear of the procession is formed by the notables of Lydia, and a gold chariot drawn by slaves. In this chariot are King Candaules, Gyges and the principal ministers. Nisia follows on a magnificently accoutred elephant. She is surrounded by girls who rain down flowers.
The triumphal procession stops at the centre of the arena. The nobles offer their King the keys of his capital, then the captives are paraded before him. Finally, Candaules, accompanied by Nisia, takes his seat and the festival begins.
First, there is a dance by nymphs, bayadères and graces. Just before the dance ends, a Lydian representing a sunflower and surrounded by other dancers representing roses and forget-me-nots treads a measure. Nisia is entreated to take part and represent Venus.
At first, she refuses, then consents. A new dance begins in which Nisia, cupids, nymphs and sylphs take part. Everyone does homage to the new Venus and Candaules, drunk with pride, declares his consort to be the true Venus. Nisia declines these compliments, but Candaules orders the statue of Venus to be removed from its pedestal and Nisia lifted in its place. Candaules and his courtiers acclaim her as a goddess. The warriors present arms and the women strew flowers at her feet. All at once, the sky grows dark and the priests and people look away in fear, while Candaules, in his arrogance, seems to defy the powers of Heaven.
ACT 3
The Queen's bathing-place. Splendid tables are laid with gold dishes. In the background is a bathing-pool of pink and while marble, adorned with a fountain and surrounded with flowers
Nisia is seen standing beneath a curtain and attended by female slaves. They dress her hair and remove her jewels. Others hold up a mirror in which she admires herself. To the music of harps, the slaves take up a series of attitudes and afterwards, Nisia dances. During the last group, a curtain falls and masks the bathing-pool.
The Queen's ladies enter and prepare to receive her. Nisia arrives, splendidly attired and attended by many slaves. The arrival of Candaules is announced. He kneels before the Queen whom he has elevated to a goddess. He is surrounded by the women who attempt to fascinate him.
Suddenly, Gyges runs in distraught, for he is the bearer of evil news. He is followed by the priests of Venus who demand an audience with the King. Candaules, alarmed, orders them to be admitted. The priests are afraid, for Venus has already given signs of her displeasure, since hunger, pestilence and other miseries have fallen on the land and are spreading throughout Lydia.
The King asks the High Priest how the goddess can be appeased. He replies that the goddess insists that Nisia shall be punished by being forced the renounce her title of Queen. Nisia is terrified and the King refuses the demand. Then the Priest warns him to beware of the anger of the gods. The sky darkens, thunder rolls, lightning flashes and the tremor of an earthquake is felt.
Candaules induces Nisia to renounce her title and she flings her gold circlet to the ground. The King falls on his knees and swears eternal love. The sky clears and the Priest returns thanks to Heaven, but Nisia looks contemptuously at Candaules and seeks consolation from her women.
ACT 4
Scene 1 - The bedchamber of King Candaules
The King is seen asleep on a couch. Nisia sits beside a table on which rests his crown. She gazes sadly on this symbol of earthly power, conscious of the gloomy future that lies before her. Then she looks at Candaules, the cause of her fall.
In her anger, she menaces the sleeping King. At the same moment, a curtain parts and Pythia appears, bearing a golden cup. She tells Nisia that it contains poison and urges her to satisfy her revenge, for Gyges will marry her and she will again become a Queen. A vision of Gyges is seen at the far end of the room.
Candaules awakes and Pythia disappears. Courtiers enter, including Gyges. All pass by Nisia without noticing her, save only Gyges who bows before her as usual. Nisia conceals her displeasure, but vows vengeance, Candaules, still in love with his wife, tries to calm her. He asks her to dance for him. She consents, but asks him to send everyone away, since she is a slave now and only he may see her dance. At Candaules's command, the courtiers retire.
Nisia dances and soon captivates the amorous king. He tries to embrace her, but she eludes him. Meanwhile, Pythia watches behind a curtain and points to the poisoned cup. Nisia takes it and presents it to Candaules with averted eyes. The King drains the cup. He feels the effects of the poison and strikes a gong, but Pythia appears. As Candaules writhes in the throes of death, Gyges and his courtiers rush in. Gyges goes to help the King, but Pythia forces him to confess that Gyges is the rightful monarch. Gyges takes the King's crown and presents it to Nisia who, surprised, looks at Pythia, who reminds her of her prediction.
Scene 2 - A hall in the palace of King Candaules. On the terrace is a table laid with gold dishes. The hall is lit with bronze scones
A betrothal feast is in progress, for Gyges has become King of Lydia and is to wed Nisia. Courtiers and nobles are present. The priests enter to conduct the marriage ceremony. They bring a sacrificial table. Gyges, crowned, leads his bride towards the table, places a hand over the holy flame and takes a vow. Nisia does the same, but the flame expires and there is a clap of thunder. The people are astonished at this portent and the priests withdraw from the table. Gyges, enraptured with Nisia, ignores the warning, takes the Queen towards the gardens and commands the festival to begin.
The proceedings open with the Dance of Diana, in which Endymion and a satyr take part. Slaves wait on the guests who are reclining at the tables and fill their cups with wine.
Gyges asks the Queen to join in the dancing. She takes a cup and empties it as if to drown her thoughts. She dances in a trance and empties another cup, which is filled by the ghost of Candaules, who suddenly tears the crown from her head. Terrified, she swoons and Gyges hurries to her side and endeavours to lead her to her throne, but again, the ghost appears. Nisia, panic-stricken, runs among the dancers, who cannot see the reason for her fear. At last, exhausted, she falls in Gyges's arms, but the ghost points to his grave, where he awaits his guilty wife. A deathly pallor steals over her features and she sinks to the ground dead. Gyges, overcome with grief, tries to restore her to life. At this moment, Pythia appears. She tells Gyges not to grieve, but to thank Heaven for having preserved him from death and she indicates a cup of poison that Nisia had prepared for him.
Gyges and all present withdraw from Nisia's body. A blue sky appears and in a diamond temple, Venus is seen surrounded by cupids. The jealous goddess, with an expression of triumph, points to Nisia's lifeless body, as if to warn those who seek to rival the goddess of eternal beauty.

The Diana and Actaeon pas de deux[edit]
Today, the most famous passage from Le Roi Candaule is the so-called Diane et Actéon Pas de deux that is mostly performed at galas and is performed in the second act of Yuri Burlaka and Vasily Medvedev's 2009 revival of La Esmeralda for the Bolshoi Ballet.[3]
The original title of this pas was Les Aventures amoureuses de Diane or simply the Pas de Diane and was originally a pas de trois danced by Diana the Roman Goddess of the Hunt, Endymion the shepherd and a satyr, reflecting the myth of the passion between Diana and Endymion. It is believed that Petipa's inspiration for this pas was a painting by the Russian painter, Karl Bryullov. The traditional version that is danced today is not by Petipa, but by Agrippina Vaganova, who staged her own version of the Pas de Diane when she transferred it into a revival of La Esmeralda in 1935. She altered the scheme by removing the role of the satyr and changing the lead male role to the hunter, Actaeon, with whom Diana dances in the company of twelve of her nymphs. This was a very strange change on Vaganova's part since Diana and Actaeon were not lovers, but had one association when he stumbled upon her bathing naked with her nymphs, after which, she transformed him into a stag and he was hunted down and killed by his own hunting dogs.[4]
However, Petipa's original scheme and Bryullov's painting also contain a mythological inaccuracy in that they both erroneously portray Endymion as the lover of Diana; this is an inaccuracy that appears in several ballets, including Léo Delibes's Sylvia.[5] In fact, Endymion was the lover of Luna the Roman Goddess of the Moon (Selene in Greek mythology) and never had any association with Diana at all. Diana's famous love interest was actually the Titan hunter, Orion.

Ballet by George Balanchine
Marize Fumero and Arionel Vargas in Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux at the Ravello Festival in 2016
Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux[a] is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to a composition by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky originally intended for act 3 of Swan Lake (Op. 20, 1875–76).[2] With costumes by Barbara Karinska and lighting by Jack Owen Brown, it was first presented by New York City Ballet at the City Center of Music and Drama, New York, on 29 March 1960. Robert Irving conducted the New York City Ballet Orchestra. The dancers were Violette Verdy and Conrad Ludlow.[3]


Background[edit]
In 1877, Anna Sobeshchanskaya, prima ballerina of the Bolshoi Theater in Moscow, made her debut in the dual role of Odette/Odile in Swan Lake.[2] After three performances, she was so dissatisfied with the choreography of Julius Reisinger that she asked for new material for the role of Odile in act 3. With permission from the producers, she traveled from Moscow to Saint Petersburg to ask Marius Petipa, ballet master of the Imperial Theaters, to set a pas de deux for Odile and Siegfried to replace the pas de six that functioned as the grand pas in act 3. This he did, using music written by Ludwig Minkus.[4] Upon learning this, Tchaikovsky was angered by the idea of a Minkus composition being inserted into his ballet score, so he composed a new pas de deux for the ballerina, even matching the structure of the Minkus piece so that she would not have to change Petipa's choreography.[5] It was a standard pas de deux classique, with a short entrée, a grand adage, a variation for the danseur, a variation for the ballerina, and a coda.[6] Madame Sobeshchanskaya was, apparently, pleased.
For more than seventy years, this pas de deux was forgotten.[5] Because it was a later composition, it was not published as part of Tchaikovsky's score and was thought to have been lost.[5] Accidentally discovered in 1953 in the archives of the Bolshoi Theater among the orchestral parts for another ballet, it came to the attention of George Balanchine, who successfully sought permission to use it for his own choreography.[7]

Choreography[edit]
Described by the New York City Ballet as ""an eight-minute display of ballet bravura and technique,""[2] Tschaikovsky Pas de Deux opens with an expectant, lyrical entrée, as the dancers discover each other on stage, join hands, and take an opening pose. This leads into a softly romantic grand adage of balances, turns, and lifts that swells to an ardent climax before subsiding to a gentle closing, ending in a famous pose: an exaggerated ""fish dive"" with the ballerina cradled at her hips between her partner's arms, her hands held in his, her legs neatly crossed at the ankles, and her face very close to the floor. In the original performances by Verdy and Ludlow, she would turn her head at the last count of the music and look quizzically up at him as if to say, ""Hello—what am I doing down here?""[8][b] The ebullient male variation that follows, which was originally much longer, varies from performer to performer, although the sequence of steps is much the same, featuring big jumps and double tours en l'air. The choreography for the ballerina's variation is, however, rigorously maintained, with a darting attack and flashing footwork expressing the sparkling melodic line. The air-flung coda builds dramatically with the music in high lifts, dazzling turns, and breathtaking leaps, as the ballerina flies across the stage into the waiting arms of her partner.[9] Finally, she is carried offstage, high overhead, with one leg extended in front, her arms and head flung back in rapturous abandon.
The steps for the opening and closing parts of the ballet are much the same as those that Balanchine set at the beginning of his work on the piece, with Diana Adams and Jacques d'Amboise. Other sequences and the variations were devised to suit Verdy and Ludlow as the choreography developed.[10]

^ At the New York City Ballet, the composer's last name is spelled as ""Tschaikovsky"" rather than ""Tchaikovsky"", as the composer used the ""Tschaikovsky"" spelling during a visit to New York in 1891.[1]

^ Few of Verdy and Ludlow's successors, if any, take this pose, preferring a less difficult position with the ballerina held higher off the floor and with her legs in a cocked-bow-and-arrow position. Almost no ballerina heeds Verdy's instruction to look up at her partner in puzzled amusement, which diminishes the witty effect of the final pose.

1941 ballet by George Balanchine
""Ballet Imperial"" redirects here. For other uses, see Ballet Imperial (disambiguation).


Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2ChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicPyotr Ilyich TchaikovskyPremiereJune 25, 1941 (1941-06-25)Teatro MunicipalOriginal ballet companyAmerican Ballet CaravanDesignMstislav DobuzhinskyCreated forMarie-JeanneGisella CaccialanzaWilliam Dollar
Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2,[a] also titled Ballet Imperial, is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 2. Ballet Imperial was choreographed for American Ballet Caravan's 1941 South American tour, and was aimed at showing that the Americans were capable of the classical ballet traditions. The ballet pays tribute to Tchaikovsky, the classical ballet choreographer Marius Petipa, and Imperial Saint Petersburg, where Balanchine received his ballet training. The ballet featured academic steps and alludes to Imperial Russia through the costumes and scenery. Ballet Imperial premiered on June 25, 1941, at Teatro Municipal, Rio de Janeiro.
In 1973, Balanchine, believing the audience no longer needed elaborate costumes and scenery to understand a ballet, removed all allusions to Imperial Russia and renamed it Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2, with the ballet now standing in relation to the music alone. The ballet has been performed by several ballet companies, including Balanchine's New York City Ballet, though some troupes still perform the ballet as Ballet Imperial.


Development[edit]
Ballet Imperial[edit]
In 1941, impresario Lincoln Kirstein was invited by his friend Nelson Rockefeller to organize a dance tour across South America subsidized by the US government. Rockefeller, who had been appointed Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was given a budget to build cultural and financial relations in South America amid World War II.[2]: 128–129 [3] Kirstein said he ""was given a check which seemed so large that I was as scared as if I had stolen it.""[4] Kirstein brought in choreographer George Balanchine, and the two hurriedly formed the American Ballet Caravan, with dancers from their two previous troupes, American Ballet and Ballet Caravan. Most of the dancers had trained at the School of American Ballet under Balanchine.[2]: 128–129 [3]
Balanchine and Kirstein decided to present a work to show that Americans are capable of the classical ballet traditions. However, instead of reviving a classic such as Swan Lake or The Sleeping Beauty, Balanchine decided to choreograph a new work that would revitalize the classical tradition, using the vocabulary of Marius Petipa, ""the father of the classic ballet.""[2]: 129 [5][6] He also decided to make the ballet plotless to allow more time for dancing.[2]: 129  Balanchine decided to use Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No. 2, the version abridged by Alexander Siloti.[3] Though Petipa and Tchaikovsky had worked together, Petipa would not have used this type of music for dance as it was symphonic, not divided by numbers.[2]: 129 
The original set and costumes were designed by Mstislav Dobuzhinsky. The backdrop showed a view of Neva river from the Winter Palace. The women are dressed in tutus, with the lead ballerina wearing a crown.[7] Balanchine donated the Dobuzhinsky designs to the Museum of Modern Art, to help wartime arts programs in army camps.[3] Ballet Imperial had subsequently been redesigned many times, by designers such as Eugene Berman, Carl Toms, Rouben Ter-Arutunian and Karinska, all inspired by Imperial Russia.[1][8]

Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2[edit]
In 1973, Balanchine stripped all allusions to Imperial Russia in the ballet and renamed it Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2, with the ballet standing only in relation to the music.[1][5]  Balanchine also removed the mime passage in the ballet.[6] In his 1977 book Balanchine's Complete Stories of the Great Ballets, he explained the changes,[6]I made these changes because the times have changed since the ballet was first done. Our audiences these days don't require elaborate costumes and decoration  [sic] in a ballet, and rightly so. We see dancing better than we used to and prefer to see it directly, unencumbered. The music and the dancing themselves are enough here, I hope, to form illusions that scenery and costumes only made specific.

Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2 was first staged at the New York City Ballet, and was danced before a plain cyclorama. Karinska redesigned the costumes, with the women in mid-calf chiffon dresses rather than tutus.[5] The costumes were redesigned several times throughout the years.[1]

Choreography[edit]
Ballet Imperial pays tribute to Petipa, Tchaikovsky and imperial Saint Petersburg, where Balanchine received his ballet training.[3][6] Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2, with no allusions to Imperial Russia,[5] is ""a work that alludes only to its Romantic, evocative score through powerful kinetic expressiveness,"" as described in the International Encyclopedia of Dance by Reba Ann Adler.[8]
Balanchine described, ""It is a dance ballet and has no story.""[6] The choreography features academic steps inspired by Petipa.[2]: 129  The ballet is danced by two principal ballerinas, a partner for the first ballerina, two men supporting the second ballerina, two female demi-soloists and a corps de ballet.[2]: 130  The first ballerina role, originated by Marie-Jeanne, is considered one of the most difficult roles among Balanchine's works.[7] The role of her partner, however, is more subdued, serving mostly as a supporter for the lead ballerina.[5] In Ballet Imperial, he performs a mime passage.[6] The second ballerina role was created because it would be impossible for one ballerina to dance to all the cadenza.[2]: 130  Though corps de ballet in Petipa's days were merely background to the soloists, the corps in Ballet Imperial are active participants that dances challenging choreography like the principal dancers.[2]: 129 

Original cast[edit]
The dancers who originated the five lead roles in Ballet Imperial are:[5]

Marie-Jeanne
Gisella Caccialanza
William Dollar
Fred Danieli
Nicholas Magallanes
Performances[edit]
Ballet Imperial had a preview performance on May 29, 1941, at the Little Theater of Hunter College, New York. The ballet then officially premiered on June 25, 1941, at Teatro Municipal, Rio de Janeiro, during the first performance of the tour.[2]: 131 [8] American Ballet Caravan performed in nine countries, and the tour ended in October, after which the troupe disbanded.[9]
In 1942, Ballet Imperial was performed at the New Opera, with a cast led by Mary Ellen Moylan, Dollar and Caccialanza.[5] In 1945, Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo, where Balanchine was a resident choreographer, performed the ballet. The first cast featured Moylan, Maria Tallchief and Nicholas Magallanes.[6] In 1950, the Sadler's Wells Ballet (now the Royal Ballet) debuted the ballet with Margot Fonteyn, Michael Somes and Beryl Grey in the lead roles.[8] La Scala Theatre Ballet first performed the ballet in 1952.[6]
New York City Ballet, founded by Balanchine and Kirstein, first danced Ballet Imperial in 1964, staged by Frederic Franklin, with Suzanne Farrell, Jacques d'Amboise, Patricia Neary, Frank Ohman and Earle Sieveling in the leading roles.[5] The premiere of Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2 in 1973, also by the New York City Ballet featured a cast led by Patricia McBride, Peter Martins, Colleen Neary, Tracy Bennett and Victor Castelli.[8]
After Balanchine's death in 1983, several ballet companies, including the Royal Ballet, began performing the ballet under the title Ballet Imperial and with the Imperial Russian grandeur again. Some troupes that acquired the ballet after Balanchine's death also opted to dance Ballet Imperial.[1]
Other ballet companies that had danced Ballet Imperial or Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2 include the Paris Opera Ballet,[10] Mariinsky Ballet,[7] American Ballet Theatre, Australian Ballet,[11] Miami City Ballet,[1] Boston Ballet,[12] Houston Ballet,[13] Pacific Northwest Ballet,[14] Finnish National Ballet,[15] Los Angeles Ballet,[16] and Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre.[17]

Theme and Variations[edit]
Main article: Theme and Variations (ballet)
Balanchine set the final movement of Tschaikovsky's third orchestra suite in 1947 for Ballet Theatre under the title Theme and Variations. He incorporated this choreography substantially unchanged into Tschaikovsky Suite No. 3 as the fourth–and final–movement, which is sometimes called Tema con variazioni, when he set the entire suite.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Twinkliana is a ballet made by Sean Lavery, assistant to the ballet master in chief at New York City Ballet, for students of the Barnard College Dance Department, to Mozart's Variations on ""Ah vous dirai-je, Maman"" (or ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star""). The premiere took place Thursday, 11 October 1990 at Barnard's Minor Latham Playhouse. It represents an homage to George Balanchine, whose works include Ivesiana, Mozartiana and Glinkaiana (who was, in turn, paying tribute to Fokine's Chopiniana).  
The ballet begins with a series of solos, followed by a pas de deux and a finale. It was revived at the School of American Ballet (SAB) Workshop in June, 2007.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet by William Forsythe


The Vertiginous Thrill of ExactitudeThe Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude performed at Liceu, BarcelonaChoreographerWilliam ForsytheMusicFranz SchubertPremiere20 January 1996 (1996-01-20)Städtische Bühnen FrankfurtOriginal ballet companyFrankfurt Ballet [de]DesignStephen GallowayWilliam Forsythe
The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude is a ballet choreographed by William Forsythe to the finale of Schubert's Symphony No. 9. The ballet was choreographed for Frankfurt Ballet [de]'s programme Six Counter Points, and was presented as a ballet ""in the Manner of the late 20th Century.""[1] Danced by a cast of five, the ballet features classical and technically demanding choreography. It premiered on 20 January 1996, at Frankfurt. It had since been performed by many other ballet companies.


Choreography[edit]
The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude is set to the finale, allegro vivace, of Schubert's Symphony No. 9. The ballet is usually danced to a recording of the score, with amplification effects.[2][3] The ballet is danced by three women and two men, with solos, duets, trios and group formations. The choreography consists of classical ballet steps.[a][2][3] Dance critic Zoë Anderson described the ballet, ""The performance style looks back to the graciousness of nineteenth-century tutu works, while moving at a walloping pace.""[3] Dance researcher Ann Nugent wrote that the ballet is ""effectively a baroque ballet where classical form is embellished by the limbs' delicate tracery. It is supremely elegant, with just the hint of a subtext, a sense that the classical occasionally likes to break out of its restraints.""[2]

Vertiginous Thrill is known for its technically demanding choreography, to the point where a dancer told Forsythe she would rather give birth again than to dance the ballet.[3] He explained, Apparently, it has a reputation of being extremely difficult to dance. But then again, dancers do like challenge. I made it for that reason, to exploit the talent that I had at that time... one of the really important things is for people to pay attention to the music. People get involved  with the steps, which are finally of absolutely no value without the musicality. I think that I'd left a lot of the musical nuance over to those dancers because they were so skilled. Then you go back, and you're going, 'Okay, what was it exactly?' You thought it was somehow all your own craft, and it wasn't, it was actually their incredible artistry.[3]
Development[edit]
Forsythe, the artistic director of Frankfurt Ballet [de], choreographed The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude for company's full-evening programme Six Counter Points, which also incorporates his earlier ballets Four Point Counter and The The, and three other new ballets, Duo, Trio and Approximate Sonata.[1][5] Vertiginous Thrill is the last ballet on the programme, and along with Approximate Sonata, are presented as ""Two Ballets in the Manner of the late 20th Century"".[1] The five original cast members are Laura Graham, Francesca Harper, Helen Pickett, Noah D. Gelber and Desmond Richardson.[3]
Forsythe also designed the decor and lighting.[3] The costumes were designed by Stephen Galloway, who was the company's head costume designer, style coordinator and a principal dancer.[6] The men are dressed in red leotards. The women are in pancake-like green tutus. Unlike traditional tutus, these are flat, single-layered and stiff, with no underfills.[3][6]

Performances[edit]
The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude performed at Liceu, Barcelona
The Vertiginous Thrill of Exactitude premiered on 20 January 1996, at Städtische Bühnen Frankfurt, along with the rest of the Six Counter Points program.[1][7]
Many other ballet companies had performed Vertiginous Thrill,[3] including Paris Opera Ballet, the Royal Ballet, Stuttgart Ballet,[2] Mariinsky Ballet,[5] San Francisco Ballet,[8] Dutch National Ballet,[4] National Ballet of Canada,[9] Boston Ballet,[10] Pacific Northwest Ballet,[11] Vienna State Ballet,[12] Pennsylvania Ballet and Rome Opera Ballet.[13][14]

Notes[edit]


^ In 2023, the Dutch National Ballet performed the ballet with six women and two men, with the choreography spread out between more dancers, and the six women only gather near the end of the ballet.[4]

Reception[edit]
In the Village Voice, the ballet's premiere at the NYBC 2002 Spring Gala was described by Deborah Jowitt as beginning ""startlingly"", with the male lead dancing and interacting with the on-stage piano, becoming ""fascinating"" as more musicians and dancers are added, but in parts feeling ""long and aimless"".[1] The New York Times review of the debut found the piece ""witty neo-Futurist, neo-Dada and neo-Absurdist"", praising its use of musicians and dancers used in ""startling supple shapes"", and its ""distinctive originality.""[2] In a review the following year, the Times again described the dancing as ""superb"" and ""marvelous"", calling the ballet ""a creative work.""[3]

La VestaleMikhail Mordkin as Lucio ca. 1900ChoreographerMarius PetipaMusicMikhail IvanovLibrettoSergei KhudekovPremiere17 February [O.S. 29 January] 1888 (Imperial Mariinsky Theatre)St. Petersburg, RussiaGenreGrand ballet
La Vestale (en. The Vestal) is a grand ballet in three acts and four scenes with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Mikhail Ivanov. The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on 17 February [O.S. 29 January] 1888 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia.


History[edit]
After the extraordinary success of the Italian Prima Ballerina Virginia Zucchi's performances in La Esmeralda in St Petersburg, Petipa went on to produce some of the finest ballets in his repertoire for Italian ballerinas. One of these great ballets was The Vestal, which was created for the benefit performance of Elena Cornalba. The ballet was a phenomenal success and among ballet historians, it is considered the predecessor of The Sleeping Beauty. Many critics who saw the première commented unanimously that the work was the epitome of the Ballet à Grand Spectacle. Set in Ancient Rome, the ballet was built on fantastical themes, complete with gods and goddesses, Emperors, and the like. The sets, costumes, and props were considered the best yet seen on the Imperial stage. Mikhail Ivanov's music proved to be the first successful score for the ballet that was provided by a symphonic composer.[1]
Although the ballet was not notated and is not performed today, at least two variations from the ballet's score are used in different pieces. One variation is that entitled L'Armour, which was composed and added to the score by Riccardo Drigo as a variation for Cupid, the God of Love. This variation was performed with great acclaim by the ballerina, Maria Anderson and appears in the Bolshoi Ballet's staging of the Paquita Grand Pas Classique, staged by Russian choreographer, Yuri Burlaka. Burlaka also utilised another supplemental variation by Drigo for his Awakening of Flora Pas de quatre; this variation is entitled L'Echo and was composed and added to the score by Drigo for Elena Cornalba.

431,Victoria and Merrie England,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_and_Merrie_England,"Victoria and Merrie England , to music by Arthur Sullivan , 1897","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




Programme from the ballet, 1897
Victoria and Merrie England, billed as a ""Grand National Ballet in Eight Tableaux"" is an 1897 ballet by the choreographer Carlo Coppi with music by Arthur Sullivan, written to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria, commemorating her sixty years on the throne. The ballet became very popular and ran for nearly six months.


Background[edit]
In honour of the Jubilee, Alfred Maul, manager of the Alhambra Theatre, asked Sullivan to compose a patriotic ballet to a scenario by the theatre's resident choreographer, Coppi.[1] As the nation's pre-eminent composer, Sullivan was the natural choice to write the music.[2] An alternate Jubilee composition, a poem submitted to Sullivan by the Poet Laureate, Alfred Austin, was never set.[citation needed]
Sullivan composed the piece mostly on the French Riviera, combining the task with visits to the casino.[2] Nevertheless, he took the commission seriously and produced one of his few successes in the decade of the 1890s. Victoria and Merrie England opened on 25 May 1897 and ran for six months at the Alhambra Theatre, which was a generous run for this kind of piece. Members of the British royal family were reported to have attended at least nineteen times.[2] The orchestra was under the direction of the Alhambra's resident conductor Georges Jacobi.[3]

Description of the ballet[edit]
Although Sullivan's autograph manuscript does not survive, Roderick Spencer of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society reconstructed the score from several sources, including earlier scores from which Sullivan drew, the piano reduction, and other clues that he gleaned from letters and news reports. Sullivan extracted three orchestral suites from the ballet, but only one of these survives.[2] Sullivan's assistant, Wilfred Bendall, prepared the published piano reduction of the ballet.[4]
The ballet consists of a series of seven historical vignettes in praise of Britain, such as ""Ancient Britain,"" Christmas in the time of Charles II, and two scenes devoted to Queen Victoria.[4] The score is a pot-pourri of characteristically English music. The staging too, was essentially British: the Sullivan scholar Selwyn Tillett writes of the Alhambra ballets that they had ""little to do with the mainstream of classical ballet as it is understood today. Neither Swan Lake nor Sylvia was seen in London complete until the Dyagilev tour of 1911–12 ... cut off from the classical source, Alhambra ballet had developed in a unique direction of its own."" Tillett describes the Alhambra ballets as  ""mime-dramas"" with many individual scenes and ""speciality"" dances.[1] The work did not become part of the standard ballet repertoire.[2] In the score, Sullivan re-used material from his Imperial March (1893) and his only other ballet, L'Ile Enchantée (1864). The final scene, after a depiction of Victoria's coronation, ends in a contemporary dance for soldiers from the various parts of Great Britain and its colonies and includes a counterpoint of characteristic tunes representing England, Scotland and Ireland, among which is Sullivan's own mock-patriotic ""He is an Englishman"", from H.M.S. Pinafore.[4][5]

Ballet by George Balanchine

Vienna Waltzes is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to music by Johann Strauss II, Franz Lehár and Richard Strauss, made as a tribute to Austria. It premiered on June 23, 1977 at the New York State Theater, performed by the New York City Ballet, and was an immediate success among the public.


Background and production[edit]
Balanchine had been exposed to Viennese dancing since his youth, and had used the 34 time signature, which is commonly used in waltz, in some of his works, including Les Valses de Beethoven (1933), The Bat (1936), Waltz Academy (1944), La Valse (1951), Valse Fantaisie (1953), Liebeslieder Walzer (1960) and Trois Valses Romantiques (1967).[1] Balanchine conceived the idea of Vienna Waltzes, a large-scale homage to Austria, over a year before he started working on it, having previously made Union Jack, a tribute to Great Britain. Before he started working on the ballet, he spoke with members of the New York City Ballet about his ideas.[1][2] This would be the last ballet in this style he made,[1] which he called ""applause machine.""[3] Suzanne Farrell, one of Balanchine's favourite dancers, called Vienna Waltzes ""his last word on the survival of romanticism.""[4]: 236 
Balanchine started choreographing Vienna Waltzes in March 1977.[4]: 236  Speaking about the selection of music, he said wanted to use Franz Lehár's and Johann Strauss II's music for ""years and years."" He had said he preferred works by Lehár over Ludwig van Beethoven's, because the former is ""more interesting, less boring."" He described Strauss as ""fantastic, a great composer, a Mozart of that type of music: operettas, trios, solos."" Richard Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier, which Balanchine called ""beautiful,"" was also used in the ballet[5] On the use of ""light opera"" music, he said, ""Operettas are a beautiful thing."" He added, ""In Russia, I saw nothing but that for a while. I was brought up on operettas."" The scores used in the ballet are ordered chronologically.[5] On waltz, Balanchine recalled, ""In Russia, we danced waltzes at the balls. Some were slow."" However, ""Waltzing is very difficult... You cannot waltz if your body is not ready... The man doesn't turn around the girl, the girl turns around the man. The problem is using two legs in [34] time. It would be easier if we had three legs.""[5]
In her memoir, Farrell wrote that after Balanchine told him she was cast, she was not called to any rehearsals for weeks. By the time she started rehearsing, her frequent partners, Jacques d'Amboise and Peter Martins, had already been cast in other sections, so her partner would be Jean-Pierre Bonnefous.[4]: 236  However, d'Amboise dropped out due to an injury, so the role was made on new member Sean Lavery, who found Balanchine worked quickly.[2][5] The ballet was made on a cast of 74 dancers.[5] Speaking about large-scale ballets such as Vienna Waltzes and Union Jack, original cast member Kay Mazzo said, ""it was fun. It wasn't challenging, but Balanchine was in a good frame of mind and everybody was in them and nobody felt left out.""[6]
The sets were designed by Rouben Ter-Arutunian, and are visual representations of the scores.[5] The costumes and lighting were designed by Karinska and Ronald Bates respectively.[7]
Following Balanchine's death, the world rights of Vienna Waltzes and five other ballets went to original cast member Karin von Aroldingen.[8]

Structure and choreography[edit]
The first three sections of the ballet are all set in a woodland, with five trees Balanchine specifically requested, and choreographed to scores by Johann Strauss II.[5] The first is set to ""Tales from the Vienna Woods,"" Op. 325, led by a woman in pink gown and man in military uniform, alongside a corps de ballet of ten couples, as New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff described, ""strolling through a forest of five prop trees.""[1][5] The next section, described as 'sylvan interlude"" by dance critic Richard Buckle,[2] is set to ""Voices of Spring"", Op. 410. This section features a couple, with the man in what critic John Gruen called ""bucolic attire."" They dance with eight women in pastel tutus.[1][7] It is followed by ""Explosion Polka"", Op. 43, led by what Gruen called ""a couple of most unexpected appearance,"" with the woman in a corseted attire and the man in striped tights. They are joined by three other couples in identical costumes.[1]
The fourth section is set to Lehár's Gold and Silver Waltz [it]"", a score that was incorporated into Balanchine's production of Lehár's The Merry Widow.[5] Kisselgoff wrote that this part of the ballet references the opera, with the principal woman, in black gown and hat, representing the titular role of the opera, while her partner, in red and white, is her suitor and an officer.[1][7] In this section, the scenery is transformed to what Ter-Arutunian described as ""a land that is neither forest nor a salon,"" inspired by Jugendstil, a counterpart of Art Nouveau.[5] Balanchine was not satisfied with this section, and made many changes to this section after the premiere.[2]
The fifth and final section is set to the first sequence of waltzes from Richard Strauss's opera Der Rosenkavalier. The woman, in a white ballgown, first dances alone and her partner, in a black tailcoat, briefly joins her a few times.[1][4]: 236  Farrell, who created the lead female role, described the partner as ""somewhat absent."" She noted this choice was made when Balanchine was ""so tired of running out of men... that he decided I would do without, or almost."" The man was the woman's ""imaginary support, who appeared and disappeared with gallant grace and cunning throughout what was essentially a solo"" for her.[4]: 236  The set in this section is a ballroom, but instead of referencing the 18th-century, the setting of Der Rosenkavalier, it reflects early 20th century, the period in which Richard Strauss lived. According to Ter-Arutunian, the scenery here is ""a dissolution into the modern age"" and inspired by the Vienna Workshop's style of architecture.[5] At the end of the ballet, the principal dancers in previous sections and twenty other couples return to the stage in costumes identical to those worn by the couple in the Der Rosenkavalier section.[1][5]

Performances[edit]
Vienna Waltzes premiered on June 23, 1977 at the New York State Theater,[9]: 418  following a preview performance a week prior.[4]: 237  According to Farrell, between the preview and the official premiere, Bonnefous got injured while performing Balanchine's Scotch Symphony. Jorge Donn, who had danced with Farrell at the Béjart Ballet, happened to be in New York, so Farrell suggested Balanchine to have Donn replace Bonnefous. Donn continued to dance Vienna Waltzes throughout the season.[4]: 237 
Vienna Waltzes was an immediate success among the public.[9]: 347  For four seasons after the premiere, all performances of Vienna Waltzes were sold out.[6] Farrell described it as ""perhaps the single most successful ballet in the New York City Ballet's box-office history.""[3]
In 1986, Farrell included Vienna Waltzes in her final performance.[4]: 306–307 

Videography[edit]
In 1983, Vienna Waltzes was filmed for the PBS broadcast A Lincoln Center Special: A New York City Ballet Tribute to George Balanchine,[10][11] with most of the original cast returning.[12]
In 1993, the Der Rosenkavalier section of Vienna Waltzes was filmed for PBS broadcast ""The Balanchine Celebration,"" led by Stephanie Saland, Adam Lüders, and also featured Kyra Nichols, Lindsay Fisher, Heather Watts, Jock Soto, Simone Schumacher, Alexandre Proia, Maria Calegari and Erlends Zieminch. It was filmed at Saland's farewell performance.[12]
The New York City Ballet released an archival video recording of Vienna Waltzes online in June 2021, as a response to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The cast features Rebecca Krohn, Tyler Angle, Megan Fairchild, Anthony Huxley, Erica Pereira, Sean Suozzi, Teresa Reichlen, Ask la Cour, Maria Kowroski and Jared Angle.[13]

Notes[edit]


^ Donn was a guest artist. The role was created on Jean-Pierre Bonnefous, who danced the role at the preview but was unable to perform at the official premiere due to an injury.[4]: 237

Fanny Cerrito as Kathi in the Saint-Léon/Cerrito/Pugni La Vivandière, London, 1844
La Vivandière (or Markitenka, as it is known in Russia) is a ballet in one act with choreography by Arthur Saint-Léon and Fanny Cerrito, and music by Cesare Pugni.
The ballet was first presented on 23 May 1844 by the Ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre, London, England. The principal dancers were Fanny Cerrito (as Kathi, the Vivandière) and Arthur Saint-Léon (as Hans).

Revivals/Restagings[edit]
Revivals by Arthur Saint-Léon for the Ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre - 1845, 1846, and 1848.
Restaging by Jules Perrot for the Imperial Ballet under the title Markitenka, first presented on 13/25 December (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1855 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, in St. Petersburg, Russia. Principal Dancers - Maria Surovshchikova-Petipa (as Kathi, the Vivandière), and Jules Perrot (as Hans).
Revival by Marius Petipa for the Imperial Ballet, first presented on 8/20 October 1881 at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre, in St. Petersburg, Russia.
The La  Vivandière Pas de Six[edit]
A Pas de Six from Saint-Léon's original version of this ballet was notated in his own method of dance notation known as La Sténochorégraphie as an example, in a manual book that was published in Paris (1848). In 1975 the Pas de Six was reconstructed, along with Pugni's original music, by the dance notation expert Ann Hutchinson-Guest. In 1978 Pierre Lacotte staged the piece for the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet (the former Imperial Ballet), who still retain the piece in their repertory. The Pas de Six has since been staged by many ballet companies all over the world, and is known as either the La Vivandière Pas de Six, or the Markitenka Pas de Six (as it is known in Russia).
The La Vivandière Pas de Six has been realised on a DVD/Blu ray.[1]

Ballet by George Balanchine

Western Symphony is a ballet made by New York City Ballet co-founder and founding choreographer George Balanchine to American folk tunes arranged by Hershy Kay. It premiered on September 7, 1954 at the City Center of Music and Drama in New York.[1] The ballet was originally presented in practice clothes without scenery. Scenery by John Boyt and costumes by Karinska were added in 1955. Lighting was originally by Jean Rosenthal and subsequently Mark Stanley. Set in the Western United States, the ballet features cowboys and dance hall girls (or saloon girls).


Setting[edit]
The ballet follows no plot but presents several short stories throughout the ballet (similar to Serenade) outside a saloon. It is almost a satire on classical ballet with imitations of Giselle and Swan Lake (second movement).[2] The ballet originally had four movements:

Allegro[edit]
The Allegro is for four cowboys, eight girls (divided into two groups of four) and a lead couple. The lengthy Allegro goes for about ten minutes.

Adagio (Waltz)[edit]
The Adagio (Waltz) is for a lead couple and four girls representing horses. This movement is set at night. The cowboy is chasing after the lead girl who eludes him and eventually, after some flirtation, leaves without him.

Scherzo[edit]
The Scherzo was removed ca. 1960 due to the complex nature of the female bravura dancing required.

Rondo[edit]
The Rondo has a lead couple but is for the entire cast.

Music[edit]
Hershey Kay adapted and arranged the music from traditional Western melodies:







Red River Valley
Old Taylor
Rye Whiskey




Lolly-Too-Dum
Good Night, Ladies
Oh, Dem Golden Slippers
The Girl I Left Behind Me



Although the movements are entitled Allegro, Adagio (Waltz) and Rondo they don't really remain true to their titles. There is an extended Adagio pas de deux section in the Allegro, and similarly with the Adagio, the Waltz speeds up to a lively tempo.

West Side Story Suite is a ballet suite choreographed by Jerome Robbins. Robbins conceived, directed and choreographed the 1957 musical West Side Story, then co-directed its 1961 film adaptation, before including parts of the choreography in the anthology Jerome Robbins' Broadway. Robbins developed the latter to the ballet West Side Story Suite for the New York City Ballet, which premiered on May 18, 1995, at the New York State Theater.[1]


Background[edit]
Jerome Robbins was credited for conceiving, directing and choreographing the 1957 Broadway musical West Side Story,[2] with music by Leonard Bernstein, lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Arthur Laurents, inspired by William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, set in 1950s New York.[3] In the 1961 film adaptation, he co-directed with Robert Wise.[3] He incorporated the choreography to the 1989 anthology Jerome Robbins' Broadway, which is slightly rechoreographed from the original musical.[4]

Production[edit]
In the 1970s,[3] Robbins was invited to make a West Side Story ballet for the American Ballet Theatre. After learning this, George Balanchine encouraged Robbins to accept the offer because ""our boys can't fight,"" though the plan fell through.[5] In 1994, Lincoln Kirstein, a New York City Ballet co-founder, wrote to Robbins and suggested he make a West Side Story as ""a choral ballet"" because ""not only would it be a terrific boost for the company which needs a new Sleeping Beauty, but it would put us in a more stable condition, for continuity."" Comparing to The Royal Ballet's Romeo and Juliet, he claimed if the New York City Ballet has a West Side Story ballet, he ""would not feel so desperately worried about our repertory and the ageing of our audience.""[6]
Robbins claimed that when he choreographed the musical, he did not expect it to be performed as a ballet because ballet dancers ""couldn't dance it then,"" but by the time he made the ballet, ""They can jive as well as anybody else can jive, so they can move their bodies in all those different ways. They just have to push the right buttons and release them.""[3] The ballet is developed from six excerpts from Robbins' anthology Jerome Robbins' Broadway, and he added ""Something's Coming"".[5] Peter Gennaro, the co-choreographer of the original musical,[7] was credited as such in the ballet.[8] Since the dancers had no prior acting experience, Robbins had them create biographies for their characters.[5] In rehearsals, Robbins claimed that the dancers were ""holding back"", so he told them, ""Look. Each of you has your own story. You can't just be nice people then scream and yell.""[5]
In the original production, guest performers Nancy Ticotin and Natalie Toro were brought in to portray Anita and Rosalia respectively, both singing parts.[6] Danish dancer Nikolaj Hübbe, who played Riff, was able to sing ""Cool"" himself despite his lack of vocal training.[5] Robert La Fosse, a New York City Ballet dancer who played Tony on Jerome Robbins' Broadway, reprised his role here,[7] though the character's part in ""Something's Changing"" is performed by a singer in the orchestra pit,[7] as with three chorus girls in ""America"" and the female solo in ""Somewhere"".[9] Robbins was concerned that he might need to adapt the songs ""because the dancers were not trained for it,"" but he did not.[2]
Irene Sharaff designed the costumes for the ballet, having previously worked on both the musical and the film.[10] Oliver Smith and Jennifer Tipton designed the sets and lighting respectively.[7]

Original cast[edit]
Robert La Fosse as Tony
Elena Diner as Maria
Jock Soto as Bernardo
Nikolaj Hübbe as Riff
Nancy Ticotin as Anita
Natalie Toro as Rosalia
The offstage singers were Rob Lorey, Joan Barber, Stephanie Bast, Donna Lee Marshall and Karen Murphy, with Paul Gemignani conducting.[7]

Musical numbers[edit]
""Prologue""
""Something's Coming""
""The Dance at the Gym""
""America""
""Cool""
""The Rumble""
""Somewhere""[3]
The ballet starts with a spoken introduction, and to emphasize the suite form, there are bows between songs.[6]

Revivals[edit]
A few years after West Side Story Suite premiered, the New York City Ballet chose to cast their own dancers instead of Broadway actors to perform the singing roles, though the format of having offstage vocalists continues.[6][9]
In 2005, when original cast member Jock Soto retired from dancing, he included the ""Dance at the Gym"" scene in his final performance.[11] Nikolaj Hübbe, another original cast member, performed ""Cool"" in his farewell performance in 2008.[12] Chita Rivera, who created the role of Anita in the musical, served as the MC at a New York City Ballet gala in 2011 where West Side Story Suite was performed.[10]
When ballet companies add West Side Story Suite to their repertory, they must seek permissions from lyricist Stephen Sondheim, book writer Arthur Laurent, and the estates of Robbins and composer Leonard Bernstein, therefore the companies are required to hold singing auditions.[13] In 2007, the National Ballet of Canada became the first company other than the New York City Ballet to perform West Side Story Suite, and according to artistic director Karen Kain, the company acquired the ballet in honour of the tenth anniversary of Robbins' death.[9] A vocal coach was brought in to assess whether the company could perform the ballet in terms of singing, help cast performers for the three singing roles, and give the cast vocal training. As a result, the cast featured dancers across ranks.[9] The San Francisco Ballet,[14] Pacific Northwest Ballet[2] and Houston Ballet have also performed the ballet.[15]

Within the Golden Hour was created as part of San Francisco Ballet's New Work Festival, which commissioned 10 choreographers to create works for the company. It is performed by 14 dancers, including three main couples, originated by Sarah Van Patten, Pierre-François Vilanoba, Maria Kochetkova, Joan Boada, Katita Waldo and Damian Smith.[2]
In 2016, The Royal Ballet in London performed Within the Golden Hour for the first time, featuring Beatriz Stix-Brunell, Vadim Muntagirov, Lauren Cuthbertson, Matthew Golding, Sarah Lamb and Steven McRae.[3] A 2019 revival, also danced by The Royal Ballet, was filmed and released on a DVD, with Stix-Brunell, Muntagirov, Lamb, Francesca Hayward, Valentino Zucchetti and Alexander Campbell.[4]
In June 2020, in the first series of performance since the Royal Opera House's closure due to the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, which was broadcast online, dancers Mayara Magri and Matthew Ball performed a pas de deux from Within the Golden Hour, after learning it in five days. The performance was dedicated to Bosso, who died in May that year.[5] In October that year, in Royal Ballet's first full company performance since the pandemic, the finale of Within the Golden Hour was performed.[6]

Who Cares? is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to songs by George Gershwin that were orchestrated by Hershy Kay. The ballet is split in two parts, the first danced by an ensemble, and the second focuses on four principal dancers. Who Cares? premiered on February 5, 1970, at the New York State Theater, danced by the New York City Ballet.


Choreography[edit]
On Who Cares?, original cast member Karin von Aroldingen described, ""You think it's so unlike Balanchine, it's so jazzy. One would think he'd just make a jazz ballet out of it, like everyone else, a dance like Broadway, but he put it on pointe – it's sort of like a tap dance on pointe.""[1]
The ballet features seventeen songs by Gershwin. The first eight songs are danced by fifteen women and five men. Dance critic Zoe Anderson wrote that this half of the ballet is ""staged as a suite of classical dances... with some hoofer steps and showgirl poses.""[2] The second half of the ballet focuses on three women and a man. Anderson commented that ""the mood turns late-night and more romantic"" Each of the dancers has their own solos, and the man dances duets with all three women.[2] This is followed by a quartet, before the full cast returns for the finale.[3]

Production[edit]
In his book Balanchine's Complete Stories of the Great Ballets, Balanchine wrote that he became familiar with Gershwin's works  while he was still living in Europe in the late 1920s and 1930s. He believed he would not have done musical comedy works in his early choreographic career if it had not been for Gershwin's works.[3] Balanchine and Gershwin worked together on the 1938 film The Goldwyn Follies. While working on the film, Gershwin gave Balanchine a book of his songs arranged in the way he performed them in concerts.[1][3] During the production of the film, Gershwin died from a brain tumor at age thirty-eight.[5]
Balanchine wrote that he conceived the ballet while playing the songs on the Gershwin songbook, ""and thought to myself, Beautiful, I'll make a pas de deux. Then I played another, it was just as beautiful and I thought, A variation! And then another and another and there was no end to how beautiful they are.""[3] The title of the ballet came from the eponymous song also used in the ballet, that was written for the musical Of Thee I Sing.[6]
The first section Balanchine choreographed was the titular pas de deux originated by Karin von Aroldingen and Jacques d'Amboise.[7]: 499  It was the first role Balanchine made for von Aroldingen.[8] Patricia McBride recalled that Balanchine choreographed both her solo and duet quickly.[1] For the ""Fascinatin' Rhythm"" solo, she said Balanchine, who was 65, demonstrated all the steps, and danced it better than she could.[7]: 446  She rehearsed the solo with a tape recorder many times so she could dance it without counting and ""really have fun with it.""[1]
Hershy Kay was commissioned to orchestrate the score.[3] The lyrics, all by Ira Gershwin, are not included in the ballet.[4] However, when the ballet premiered, Kay only completed the first song ""Strike Up the Band"" and the last song ""I Got Rhythm"", as he was also working on a musical. Therefore, most songs were played on a piano at the premiere, with the exception of ""Clap Yo' Hands"", using 1926 recording of Gershwin playing the song.[3][9] The orchestration is complete by May 1970, few months after the ballet's premiere.[10] However, the Gershwin recording of ""Clap Yo' Hands"" was still used.[3] ""Clap Yo' Hands"" was removed from the ballet in 1976,[11] but was added back in 2010.[9]
The original costume and lighting were designed by Karinska and Ronald Bates respectively.[2] In November 1970, a New York skyline backdrop designed by Jo Mielziner is added to the ballet.[3] The costumes had since been redesigned several times.[11][12][13]

Performances[edit]
Who Cares? premiered on February 5, 1970, at the New York State Theater.[2] Since the orchestration of the score was incomplete, Gordon Boelzner played the songs on the piano.[4] Before the premiere, Balanchine was presented the Handel Medallion, New York City's highest cultural award, by mayor John Lindsay.[14]
Other ballet companies that had perform Who Cares? include English National Ballet,[15] Zürich Ballet,[11] San Francisco Ballet,[16] Pacific Northwest Ballet,[11] Atlanta Ballet,[17] Charlotte Ballet (formerly North Carolina Dance Theatre),[18][19] Sarasota Ballet,[20] Los Angeles Ballet,[21] Cincinnati Ballet,[22] Colorado Ballet and Ballet Chicago.[23][24] It was also performed on Mikhail Baryshnikov's tour Baryshnikov & Friends.[25] The School of American Ballet, the affiliated-school of the New York City Ballet, had include the ballet in its annual workshop performances.[26]
In 2014, when original cast member Patricia McBride received the Kennedy Center Honor, excerpts of Who Cares? were included in the tribute to McBride. ""Fascinatin' Rhythm"" was danced by New York City Ballet principal dancer Tiler Peck, and ""I Got Rhythm"" was danced by four members of Charlotte Ballet, Peck, and other dancers who participated in other segments of the tribute.[18]

Critical reception[edit]
Clive Barnes of the New York Times commented, ""The ballet is not likely to be regarded as one of Balanchine's major works although it does, not unexpectedly, have some extraordinarily lovely passages in it.""[4]

Videography[edit]
In 1971, excerpts of Who Cares? was televised by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, featuring original cast members Karin von Aroldingen, Patricia McBride and Marnee Morris, as well as Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux.[11]
Excerpts of Who Cares? had also been televised through PBS, including the 1983 Great Performances episode ""A New York City Ballet Tribute to George Balanchine"",[27] the 1993 Live from Lincoln Center broadcast ""The Balanchine Celebration"",[28] and the 2004 ""Balanchine 100"", also on Live from Lincoln Center.[29]
In 1989, a concert performance of Who Cares? was also included in the PBS Dance in America program ""Baryshnikov Dances Balanchine With American Ballet Theatre."" However, it was danced by the tour Baryshnikov & Friends rather than the American Ballet Theatre. In this program, only half of the ballet is danced, and the corps de ballet is removed. The four lead dancers are Baryshnikov, Christine Dunham, Leslie Browne and Deirdre Carberry.[25]

441,Wild Swans,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Swans_(ballet%29,"Wild Swans , Elena Kats-Chernin , 2003","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Wild Swans is a ballet by Meryl Tankard with score by Soviet-born Australian composer Elena Kats-Chernin.
The story is based on The Wild Swans by Hans Christian Andersen and tells the tale of Eliza, a princess whose wicked-witch stepmother has changed Eliza's eleven brothers into swans. Eliza must knit magic shirts from stinging nettles in order to break the spell and transform her brothers back into human form. With its basis in a fairy tale, the ballet follows in the tradition of Tchaikovsky's The Nutcracker and Swan Lake, with ballet scores by Russian-born composers Prokofiev and Stravinsky also acknowledged influences.
The ballet was commissioned by the Australian Ballet and the Sydney Opera House. The score was completed in 2002 in collaboration with choreographer Meryl Tankard, who also worked with Kats-Chernin on part of the opening ceremony for the 2000 Sydney Olympics. It was given its premiere by the Australian Ballet at the Sydney Opera House on 29 April 2003.


Wild Swans Concert Suite[edit]
Kats-Chernin arranged a 12-movement concert suite from the ballet score. This was recorded by the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra under Ola Rudner, with soprano Jane Sheldon, in 2004 and released on the ABC Classics label along with the composer's Piano Concerto and Mythic. The suite features prominent parts for soprano soloist; percussion, in particular the xylophone; and alto saxophone.
The suite was given its Australian concert premiere on 18 May 2008, by the SBS Radio and Television Youth Orchestra, with soprano Simone Easthope, under Matthew Krel, at the Verbrugghen Hall of the Sydney Conservatorium of Music.[1]

Lloyds TSB advertisement[edit]
The Eliza Aria recording featuring the Tasmanian Symphony Orchestra and Jane Sheldon was chosen for use in a series of television and cinema advertisements for British bank Lloyds TSB under the tagline ""For the journey"", launched in January 2007. The adverts were created by agency Rainey Kelly Campbell Roalfe Y&R, and feature animations by Studio AKA. They follow the fortunes of a couple who meet on a futuristic-looking train, called The Black Horse, after Lloyds' logo, through to their retirement. Following the initial minute-long advert, further 30-second instalments were aired, each advertising a different financial product. The touching animations combined with Kats-Chernin's music caught the public's imagination, and brought the music to attention in the United Kingdom and further afield.
Following the success of the advertisements, the recording of the suite was re-issued by ABC Classics with a new cover depicting a scene from the advert and from 2011 onwards has been used as the theme music for an ABC Radio National programme (Late Night Live), replacing another piece of hers (Russian Rag).[2]

Derived works[edit]
The Eliza Aria was also used as the basis of ""The Journey Continues"", a dance music single and music video by DJ Mark Brown and singer Sarah Cracknell. The video is notable for its use of thousands of still photographs, played in sequence to produce a surreal effect, a form of stop motion animation with live subjects.

442,Winter Dreams,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winter_Dreams_(ballet%29,"Winter Dreams , to music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky , 1991","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Winter Dreams is a one-act ballet choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan to piano pieces by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky selected and arranged by Philip Gammon and traditional Russian music selected and arranged for guitar and mandolin ensemble by Thomas Hartman. With scenery and costumes designed by Peer Farmer and lighting designed by Clive Thomas, it was first presented by The Royal Ballet at the Royal Opera House, London, on 7 February 1991.[1]


Background[edit]
Macmillan's ballet was inspired by Anton Chekhov's play Three Sisters (1900), sometimes named as one of his four best plays, along with The Cherry Orchard, The Seagull, and Uncle Vanya.[2] First performed in 1901 at the Moscow Art Theater, it concerns the intricate relationships of three sisters marooned in the stultifying atmosphere of a provincial Russian garrison town at the turn of the twentieth century. They all have ""winter dreams"" of returning to Moscow, where they imagine that their lives would be more interesting and fulfilling.[3]
The action in the ballet does not mirror all the events and incidents in the play. MacMillan noted that ""Although the characters in the ballet are named after those in the play, I have not attempted a balletic reworking of the whole story. Sometimes the choreography reflects the inner life of the characters, at other times the narrative. I have tried to capture the atmosphere and melancholy of Chekov's masterpiece.""[4]

Scenario[edit]
Olga, the eldest of the three sisters, is the matriarchal figure of the Prozorov family, though she is still a young woman. She has given up hope of marriage and has dedicated herself to the exhausting life of a high-school teacher. Masha, the middle sister, finds herself trapped in an unbearable marriage to a boring schoolmaster. She falls passionately in love, for the first time, with the idealistic Colonel Vershinin, the commander of the local army garrison. They begin a clandestine affair. When he is transferred away, she is crushed but returns to life with her forgiving husband. Irina, the youngest sister, has a romantic view of life. While longing for the excitement of Moscow, she works in a dreary job with the local town council. Just as she is about to escape to a marriage of convenience with Baron Tesenbach, he is killed in a duel with a rival suitor. The sisters' brother, Andrey, is married to Natasha, a social climber who has ambitions of taking over the family home. Observing the passions and disappointments of them all are Doctor Chebutykin, a family friend, and Anfisa, the sisters' former nanny.[5]

The Winter's TaleChoreographerChristopher WheeldonMusicJoby TalbotBased onThe Winter's Tale by William ShakespearePremiere10 April 2014 (2014-04-10)Royal Opera HouseOriginal ballet companyThe Royal BalletDesignBob Crowley
The Winter's Tale is a ballet in three acts choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon to a commissioned score by Joby Talbot. The ballet is based on the play of the same name by William Shakespeare. With scenery and costumes designed by Bob Crowley, lighting designed by Natasha Katz, and special stage effects designed by Daniel Brodie and Basil Twist, it was a co-production of the Royal Ballet and the National Ballet of Canada. It was first presented at the Royal Opera House, London, on 10 April 2014.[1] The North American premiere occurred the following year.[2]


Background[edit]
Wheeldon's ballet is a dance version of William Shakespeare's play The Winter's Tale (1609–11), considered by scholars one of his ""problem plays,"" difficult to classify as tragedy, comedy, romance, or a combination of all three. The first three of its five acts are filled with intense psychological drama; the last two are lighthearted and comedic, concluding with a happy ending. It tells a complicated story of jealousy, loss, love, joy, redemption, forgiveness, and reconciliation. Shakespeare chose his title to signify to his audiences that the play was like a tale told in company gathered by a fireside on a winter's evening. A fictional invention—not true, but entertaining and morally instructive.[3]

The story[edit]
Leontes, king of Sicilia, is possessed by a mad jealousy, believing that his pregnant wife Hermione is having an affair with his childhood friend Polixenes, king of Bohemia. He orders that Hermione's infant daughter be abandoned. Hermione and their young son Mamillius die of distress, and Leontes is overcome with remorse. The baby is found by a shepherd in Bohemia and named Perdita (""the lost one""). Sixteen years pass. Perdita falls in love with Florizel, son of Polixenes, who returns her affections and proposed marriage. Polixenes is outraged that his princely son intends to marry a commoner and is consumed by fury. Florizel and Perdita, pursued by Polixenes, seek refuge in Sicilia at the court of Leontes. Perdita is recognized, Hermione returns from the dead, and the family is reunited.

Critical reception[edit]
Upon its world premiere at the Royal Opera House, The Winter's Tale was well received by dance critics. Judith Mackrell of The Guardian gave the ballet four out of five stars and praised the ballet as ""one of most fully achieved story ballets to be created at the Royal in years.""[4] Writing for the Financial Times, Clement Crisp also awarded the ballet four out of five stars and highlighted the individual performances of the lead dancers.[5] Luke Jennings, writing in The Guardian, said that the ballet, although dramatically flawed, was ""for the most part a ravishing success"" and was definitely ""a ballet to keep.""[6]

Videography[edit]
A performance by the original cast can be seen on Opus Arte DVD 1156D. Directed for the screen by Ross MacGibbon, it was recorded at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 2014. In light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the performing arts, the recording was released online.[7]

444,The Wise Virgins,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Virgins,"The Wise Virgins , to music by Johann Sebastian Bach , 1940","



From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The Wise Virgins is a one-act ballet based on the biblical Parable of the Ten Virgins.[1]
It was created in 1940 with choreography by Frederick Ashton, to a score of music by Johann Sebastian Bach orchestrated by William Walton.

History[edit]
The music of the ballet was the first to be decided. Some years before, at an evening gathering in Cambridge with Boris Ord and Constant Lambert (Music Director of the Sadler’s Wells Ballet), the two musicians played some Bach at the piano. One of the pieces was ""Sheep may safely graze"" which comes from a secular cantata about hunting, Was mir behagt, ist nur die muntre Jagd, BWV 208.  Ashton, wanting to use this music and believing it to be a religious subject, chose the parable of the wise and foolish virgins from the Gospel of Matthew 25:1-13.[2] 
According to Michael Somes, it was a later meeting with Patrick Hadley where Hadley and Lambert played Bach’s music which settled the sequence of musical numbers for the ballet.[3] 
The movements were selected from Bach’s cantatas and chorale preludes and orchestrated from piano transcriptions.
Designer Rex Whistler was chosen for his sympathy with Baroque art, from his studies in Rome. Ashton was also inspired by 18th century sculpture and architecture, and tried to depict with the dancers' bodies ""the swirling, rich, elaborate contortions of the baroque.""[2]
The Wise Virgins was first performed on 24 April 1940 by the Vic Wells Company (The Royal Ballet) at Sadler's Wells Theatre, with Margot Fonteyn (the Bride), Michael Somes (the Bridegroom), Claude Newman (the Father), and Annabel Farjeon (the Mother) in the leading roles.[1] It continued in the company’s repertoire until 1944. 

Ballet Suite[edit]
The scoring is for 2 flutes (one doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 2 trumpets, 3 trombones, timpani and strings.

What God hath done, is rightly done (Cantata 199)
Lord, hear my longing (Chorale Prelude 'Herzlich tut mich')
See what His love can do (Cantata 85)
Ah! How ephemeral (Cantata 26)
Sheep may safely graze (Cantata 208)
Praise be to God (Cantata 129)
The suite was used for the ballet Cantus Firmus by the Ballet Vlaamderen, with choreography by Jeanne Brabants, in 1970.[3]
The suite has been recorded several times, including:

HMV Records - Sadler's Wells Orchestra, conducted by William Walton (24 July 1940)
Decca Records - London Philharmonic Orchestra at Kingsway Hall, conducted by Adrian Boult (19 October 1954)
Capitol Records - Concert Arts Orchestra, conducted by Robert Irving (4 April 1961)
Columbia Records - Cleveland Orchestra at the Masonic Auditorium in Cleveland, conducted by Louis Lane (3 April 1970)
EMI Records - City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra at Bedworth Civic Hall, conducted by Louis Frémaux (1–2 September 1976)

Pantomime ballet
This article includes a list of references, related reading, or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please help to improve this article by introducing more precise citations. (December 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
The Wooden Prince (Hungarian: A fából faragott királyfi), Op. 13, Sz. 60, is a one-act pantomime ballet composed by Béla Bartók in 1914–1916 (orchestrated 1916–1917) to a scenario by Béla Balázs. It was first performed at the Budapest Opera on 12 May 1917 under the conductor Egisto Tango.


The work[edit]
The Wooden Prince has never achieved the fame of Bartók's other ballet, The Miraculous Mandarin (1926) but it was enough of a success at its premiere to prompt the Opera House to stage Bartók's opera, Bluebeard's Castle (which had not been performed since 1911) in the following year. Like Bluebeard, The Wooden Prince uses a huge orchestra (it even includes saxophones), though the critic Paul Griffiths believes it sounds like an earlier work in style (Griffiths p. 71). The music shows the influence of Debussy and Richard Strauss, as well as Wagner (the introduction echoes the prelude of Das Rheingold). Bartók used a scenario by the poet Béla Balázs, which had appeared in the influential literary journal Nyugat  in 1912.

Instrumentation[edit]
This work contains the largest orchestration which Bartók ever scored for:

Woodwinds: 4 flutes (third doubling on piccolo 2, fourth on piccolo 1), 4 oboes (third on English horn 2, fourth on English horn 1), 4 clarinets (third doubling on E-flat clarinet, fourth on bass clarinet), 4 bassoons (third and fourth doubling on contrabassoons), Alto saxophone in E♭, tenor saxophone in B♭ (doubling on baritone saxophone in E♭)
Brass: 4 horns, 6 trumpets (4 trumpets and 2 cornets, all in B♭), 3 trombones, tuba
Percussion (timpanist and 5 players): timpani, bass drum, cymbals, snare drum, field drum, triangle, tam-tam, glockenspiel, xylophone, castanets
2 harps, celesta for 4 hands
Strings: 16 first and 16 second violins, 12 violas, 10 cellos, 8 double basses
Synopsis[edit]
A prince falls in love with a princess, but is stopped from reaching her by a fairy who makes a forest and a stream rise against him. To attract the princess' attention, the prince hangs his cloak on a staff and fixes a crown and locks of his hair to it. The princess catches sight of this ""wooden prince"" and comes to dance with it. The fairy brings the wooden prince to life and the princess goes away with that instead of the real prince, who falls into despair. The fairy takes pity on him as he sleeps, dresses him in finery and reduces the wooden prince to lifelessness again. The princess returns and is finally united with the human prince.

Woolf Works is a full-length contemporary ballet choreographed by Wayne McGregor, composed by Max Richter, and inspired by Virginia Woolf's novels, letters, essays and diaries. The premiere took place on 11 May 2015 at the Royal Opera House. It was McGregor's first full-length ballet for The Royal Ballet, and won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best New Dance Production.[1]


Production[edit]
External videos Woolf Works – Orlando pas de deux (Natalia Osipova, Edward Watson; The Royal Ballet), YouTube video
In the ballet, each act represent one of Woolf's novels. The three acts, titled ""I now, I then"", ""Becomings"" and ""Tuesday"" are inspired by Mrs. Dalloway, Orlando and The Waves respectively.[2]
Alessandra Ferri, who was 52, was invited by McGregor to star in Woolf Works, as he believed her age was suitable for the role.[3] Mara Galeazzi, a former principal dancer who left the company in 2013, was asked to cover for Ferri, though Galeazzi did not perform the role until 2017.[4]
The music, composed by McGregor's frequent collaborator Max Richter, featured both classical and electronic sounds.[2] A recording of Woolf reading her essay ""On Craftsmanship"" was used in ""I now, I then.""[5] Actress Gillian Anderson provided a voice recording of reading Woolf's suicide note, which is played in the beginning of ""Tuesday.""[6] The music was released as an album titled Three Worlds: Music from Woolf Works.[7]
A 2017 revival was filmed and relayed in cinemas.[8] The film was later broadcast by BBC 4 and released on a DVD.[9][10] The Royal Opera House released the recording online in response to the impact of the 2019–20 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts.[11] In the first full company performance since the pandemic started, Edward Watson, Akane Takada and Calvin Richardson performed an excerpt from ""I now, I then.""[12][13]
La Scala Theatre Ballet in Milan debuted Woolf Works in 2019. Ferri and Federico Bonelli, a Royal Ballet principal, reprised their roles from the original production.[14]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia




Year of the RabbitChoreographerJustin PeckMusicSufjan StevensPremiereOctober 5, 2012 (2012-10-05)David H. Koch TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignJustin PeckBrandon Stirling Baker
Year of the Rabbit is a ballet choreographed by Justin Peck to music from Sufjan Stevens's album, Enjoy Your Rabbit. The ballet premiered on October 5, 2012, at the David H. Koch Theater, danced by the New York City Ballet.[1]


Production[edit]
Background[edit]
Peck joined the New York City Ballet as a dancer in 2007.[1] He made several ballets for the New York Choreographic Institute for several years.[2] His first ballet for the New York City Ballet In Creases, had a successful premiere in Saratoga Springs in July 2012,[1][3] and Year of the Rabbit, which premiered on October 5, 2012, was his first ballet to be performed in Manhattan.[4] Peck was 25 and a corps de ballet dancer with the New York City Ballet when Year of the Rabbit premiered.[1]

Music[edit]
Peck said he first heard music from Sufjan Stevens's album, Enjoy Your Rabbit in 2009, when a string quartet performed an arrangement on WNYC, and found it ""really innovative and danceable.""[2][5] He was then introduced to Stevens through a mutual friend.[6] Stevens claimed that he was initially ""flabbergasted"" by the request to provide the music as he was known for folk songs, but Enjoy Your Rabbit is an electronic score which he made as ""sort of a hobby,""[2] inspired by the animals of the Chinese zodiac, a concept he would later ""cringe a little,""[6] and said that most of his fans ""dislike"" this album.[2] Furthermore, he first found ballet ""anachronistic"" and ""didn’t understand it.""[2] However, Peck invited Stevens to various ballet performances, and Balanchine's Agon was the one that ""clicked.""[2] Once Stevens allowed his album to be used for the ballet, it had to be orchestrated by Michael P. Atkinson, who was also the conductor at the premiere, and according to Peck, a transition led to them spending two hours ""to figure out just how to count it for the dancers.""[1][6] Stevens said he did not think his music was ""danceable"" prior to Year of the Rabbit.[2]

Choreography[edit]
Year of the Rabbit is an expansion Peck made for the New York Choreographic Institute, of Tales of a Chinese Zodiac. He was supposed to work on the choreography in spring 2012, but it was pushed back to allow him to work on In Creases.[7] He had less than six weeks to work on Year of the Rabbit, and could only work with one dancer in the first three days.[7] He researched the Chinese zodiac, but concluded if he based the ballet on that ""it would drive [him] crazy."" However, he incorporated texts he read in the choreography.[7]
The ballet is performed by eighteen dancers, including six leads.[8] Peck said he wanted ""to create a sense of equality between the corps and the principal dancers.""[7] For the original cast, he chose dancers he knew well.[6] Craig Hall, an original cast member who later became Peck's rehearsal assistant, recalled when they were working on Year of the Rabbit, Peck ""pulled something out of me that I didn’t know I had in me.""[4]

Designs[edit]
Peck also designed the costumes, supervised by Marc Happel, while Brandon Stirling Baker designed the lighting.[8][9]

Revivals[edit]
Other companies that have performed the ballet include Dutch National Ballet,[10] Pacific Northwest Ballet,[5] Joffrey Ballet[11] and Houston Ballet.[12] Stagers of the ballet include original cast members Craig Hall and Janie Taylor.[13]

Critical reception[edit]
The ballet received critical acclaim. The New York Times commented, ""[i]t was a triumph not just for Mr. Peck but also for the institution that has nurtured him.""[1] DanceTabs wrote that the ballet is ""about the excitement of working in a ballet company and teasing out the things that ballet is capable of, the stimulation of structure and detail, but also of stylized athleticism,"" but pointed out some ""usual problems.""[14] Dance Magazine called it Peck's ""terrific Koch Theater debut.""[8]
Peck was nominated for the Prix Benois de la Danse for choreographing Year of the Rabbit.[15] In 2020, Dance Magazine included the ballet in its ""20 Top Works of the Last 20 Years"" list.[16]

The ballet was McGregor's first new work for The Royal Ballet in two years, and was created for Bernstein's centennial.[1] The ballet is performed by eleven dancers.[2] The sets are designed by Edmund de Waal, a writer and potter, and features light boxes.[2] The costumes are designed by Shirin Guild, and all dancers are in red loose-fitted outfits.[2] The title of the ballet means the ""beauty evoked with an economy of means"" in Japanese (幽玄 in kanji).[1][2]
Yugen is a co-production with the Dutch National Ballet, and the company will debut the ballet in September 2022. It is rescheduled from the original April 2020 date due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the Netherlands.[3][4][5]

Critical reception[edit]
The Guardian's Judith Mackrell wrote, ""McGregor’s choreography is expertly musical, seeking out the lyricism of Bernstein’s melodies in long, floating lines, and riding its energies in such cleverly massed configurations that his modest ensemble can look like a tribe.""[7] Roslyn Sulcas of the New York Times commented, ""remains intensely responsive to the slightly strange fusion of sacred text and tone, with jazzy undercurrents in 'Chichester Psalms.'""[1] The Evening Standard's Emma Byrne wrote that Yugen ""marks a new maturity: gone are the attention-grabbing pyrotechnics, and in their place just sumptuous, lyrical movement.""[8]
At the 2018 National Dance Awards, McGregor was nominated for Best Classical Choreography.[9]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Zoraiya, the Moorish Girl in Spain is a grand ballet in 4 acts/7 scenes, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Ludwig Minkus.
The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on February 1/13 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1881 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Notes[edit]
The Grand Pas des toréadors that is used in every modern production of Petipa's Don Quixote is originally from this ballet and it has been widely believed for many years that the piece was interpolated by the Balletmaster Alexander Gorsky into his 1902 restaging of Don Quixote for the Imperial Ballet. However, this is in fact not the case as the Grand Pas des toréadors was already in Don Quixote by the time Gorsky staged his revival because it was found published in the Don Quixote score in 1882.[1] Therefore, the likelihood is that it was actually Petipa himself who interpolated it into Don Quixote.

Aubadeconcerto chorégraphiqueMusic for piano and ensemble by Francis PoulencCatalogueFP 51aComposed1929 (1929)Movements8PremiereDate18 June 1929LocationPlace des États-Unis in ParisConductorFrancis Poulenc
Aubade (FR 051a, and FP051b for the piano reduction), a choreographic concerto for piano and 18 instruments, is a work of Francis Poulenc premiered in 1929. It was conceived as a ballet, but is more often played as a chamber piano concerto.


History[edit]
An aubade is a morning courting song, vs. a serenade in the evening. Here the action begins one morning, and ends the next day at dawn. Poulenc's work was originally conceived as ballet music, but is today regarded as a piano concerto. The work was premiered as a ballet on 18 June 1929 at the Noailles, which determined the size of the orchestra Poulenc could employ. The choreographer was Bronislava Nijinska. A few months later, it was revived at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in the choreography this time by George Balanchine, of which Poulenc disapproved.
Poulenc himself designed the scenario of the ballet whose theme is the solitude of women. The goddess Diana is the heroine. The action begins in a clearing. Diana's companions awaken little by little. Diana enters the scene, tormented by the chastity imposed on her. Her companions dress her then give her a bow: the hunt must serve her as a distraction. A solo of Diana follows, before she rejects the bow and goes into the forest, desperate. Her companions try to console her, but Diana goes hunting, alone. Her companions fall asleep.

Le Baiser de la fée (The Fairy's Kiss) is a neoclassical ballet in one act and four scenes composed by Igor Stravinsky in 1928 and revised in 1950 for George Balanchine and the New York City Ballet. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's short story Isjomfruen (English: The Ice-Maiden), the work is an homage to Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, for the 35th anniversary of the composer's death. Stravinsky elaborated several melodies from early piano pieces and songs by Tchaikovsky in his score. A commission by Ida Rubinstein from 1927, the ballet was choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska and premiered in Paris on 27 November 1928.[1]
In his conversations with Robert Craft, Stravinsky did not specify which Tchaikovsky pieces he drew upon,[2] but ""Danses suisses"" quotes one of the more easily identifiable Tchaikovsky themes, the ""Humoresque"" from Two Pieces, Opus 10 (1871).[3] However, musicologist David Drew provided several musical sources in his liner notes for the 1963 Decca recording of the ballet by Ernest Ansermet:[4]

Scene I: Andante. Figures from Op. 19 No. 4 and the Barcarolle 'Juin' from Op. 37 bis
Vivace agitato. Figure from Op. 54 No. 7
Scene II: Tempo giusto. Humoresque Op. 10 No. 2 and Reverie du Soir, Op. 19 No. 1

In 1937, Balanchine made a full-length ballet for his American Ballet, which premiered on 27 April, at the Old Metropolitan Opera House, New York City. His 1950 version premiered on 28 November, at City Center of Music and Drama, New York, at which time it was presented under the English translation of the title, The Fairy's Kiss (the original French title is now more commonly used by English-speakers).[citation needed]
In 1960 Kenneth MacMillan choreographed his own version for The Royal Ballet.


Divertimento from Le Baiser de la fée[edit]
The Divertimento from Le Baiser de la fée is a concert suite for orchestra based on music from the ballet. Stravinsky arranged it in collaboration with Samuel Dushkin in 1934 and revised it in 1949. It has four movements:

SinfoniaDanses suissesScherzo (Au moulin)Pas de deux
AdagioVariationCoda
In 1932 Samuel Dushkin and the composer produced a version for violin and piano, using
the same title. Another episode from the ballet was arranged for violin and piano by Dushkin with the title Ballad. However, the latter only received the composer’s assent in 1947 after the French violinist Jeanne Gautier put forward an arrangement.
Balanchine created an entirely new work for the City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival, using excerpts from the concert suite and the original ballet. The premiere took place on 21 June 1972, at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center. In 1974, Balanchine incorporated Tchaikovsky's ""None but the Lonely Heart"" for a new pas de deux.[citation needed]

Ballet by Francis Poulenc
This article is about the ballet with music by Poulenc. For the 1968 film, see Les Biches (film). For the commune in France, see Biches.
Poulenc in the early 1920s
Les biches (French: [le biʃ]) (""The Hinds"" or ""The Does"", or ""The Darlings"")[n 1] is a one-act ballet to music by Francis Poulenc, choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska and premiered by the Ballets Russes on 6 January 1924 at the Salle Garnier in Monte Carlo.[1] Nijinska danced the central role of the Hostess. The ballet has no story, and depicts the random interactions of a group of mainly young people in a house party on a summer afternoon.
The ballet was seen in Paris and London within a year of its premiere, and has been frequently revived there; it was not produced in New York until 1950. Nijinska directed revivals of the ballet for several companies in the four decades after its creation. Les biches, with recreations of Marie Laurencin's original costumes and scenery, remains in the repertoire of the Paris Opera Ballet, the Royal Ballet and other companies. The music has been used for later ballets, although they have not followed Nijinska's in gaining a place in the regular repertoire.
The music for the original ballet contains three choral numbers. Poulenc made the choral parts optional when he revised the score in 1939–1940, and the work is usually given with wholly orchestral accompaniment. The composer extracted a five-movement suite from the score, for concert performance. The suite has been recorded for LP and CD from the 1950s onwards.


Background[edit]
Sergei Diaghilev
Sergei Diaghilev, proprietor of the Ballets Russes, contacted Poulenc in November 1921 with a proposed commission.[n 2] The original plan was that Poulenc should write music for a ballet scenario with the title Les demoiselles, written by the fashion designer Germaine Bongard. The following July it became clear that Bongard did not wish to go ahead; Poulenc wrote to his friend and fellow member of Les six, Darius Milhaud, that instead ""I will probably write a suite of dances without a libretto.""[1] At about the same time he told Igor Stravinsky that after consulting Diaghilev and the designer, Marie Laurencin, ""I have a clear conception of my ballet which will have no subject – simply dances and songs.""[3]
The titles of the numbers in the score indicate that Poulenc followed this plan, but he nonetheless retained two important features of Bongarďs proposed work: a choral element, with unseen singers giving a commentary on the action, and the ""demoiselles"".[1] In an analysis published in The Musical Quarterly in 2012, Christopher Moore describes the former as reminiscent of Stravinsky's Pulcinella, and the latter as ""a corps de ballet of flirtatious young women"".[1] For the words, Poulenc spent a considerable amount of time in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, seeking out texts for the choral interjections.[4] He found what his biographer Carl B. Schmidt describes as ""some slightly obscene eighteenth-century texts"", which he used in three of the numbers in the score.[5]

Poulenc struggled to find the right name for the ballet, and eventually had the idea of calling it Les biches, echoing the title of the classic ballet Les Sylphides.[5] His chosen title is, as he admitted, untranslatable into any other language.[5][n 3] The word biche is usually translated as ""doe,"" an adult female deer; it was also used as a slang term for a coquettish woman. Moore expands on the definition: ""As has been often noted, the word biches is itself pregnant with double entendre, referring most obviously to does, but also, in the underworld of Parisian slang, to a woman (or ironically, a man) of deviant sexual proclivities.""[6][n 4]
By the middle of 1923 Poulenc had completed the first version of the score, after some help with details of orchestration from his teacher, Charles Koechlin.[8] In late October, at Diaghilev's request, he travelled to Monte Carlo to help supervise the production.[8] The composer was delighted with the work of the choreographer, Nijinska, which he described as ""ravishing""; he wrote to Milhaud that she had truly understood his score.[9] Between November 1923 and the premiere in January 1924, Poulenc, together with Nijinska, oversaw, by his estimate, ""at least 72 rehearsals or close to 250 hours of work"".[9] Les biches was an immediate success, first in Monte Carlo in January 1924 and then in Paris in May, under the direction of André Messager and has remained one of Poulenc's best-known scores.[10] Poulenc's new celebrity after the success of the ballet was the unexpected cause of his estrangement from Erik Satie, of whom he had been a protégé: among the new friends Poulenc made was Louis Laloy, a writer whom Satie regarded with implacable enmity.[11] Poulenc's friend, Georges Auric, who had just enjoyed a similar triumph with a Diaghilev ballet, Les Fâcheux, was also repudiated by Satie for becoming a friend of Laloy.[11]

Music[edit]
Poulenc revised the orchestration comprehensively in 1939–1940 (published 1947). He extracted a five-movement suite from the full ballet score (1948), omitting the overture and the three choral movements. The suite is dedicated to Misia Sert.[12] The published score specifies the following instruments: woodwind: 1 piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 1 cor anglais, 2 clarinets, 1 bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 1 contrabassoon; brass: 4 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba; percussion: percussion bass drum, field drum, glockenspiel, snare drum, suspended cymbal, tambourine, tenor drum, triangle; celeste, glockenspiel; and strings.[13]
The score of Les biches is sometimes described as neoclassical.[14] The form of the piece – an overture followed by a number of unlinked movements – follows 18th-century musical practice, and Poulenc set out to follow classical precedent in his tonal and harmonic writing. He wrote to Milhaud:

Les Biches will be very clear, sturdy and classical. The opening ensemble fluctuates between F major, dominant, sub-dominant, relative minor, etc ... just like the finales of classical symphonies; ""Jeu"" is in E, B, A, etc... and the final ""Rondeau"" is in D, A, G, etc. For the songs, I have some beautiful but slightly obscene texts (from the 18th century).[14]
The analyst Gérald Hugon writes that other influences on the young composer's score are French eighteenth-century song (in the Rondeau), ragtime (in the Rag-Mazurka) and composers ranging from the classical era (Mozart and Schubert) to contemporaries such as Stravinsky and Prokofiev, via Tchaikovsky: Hugon quotes Claude Rostand's comment that according to Poulenc the Adagietto was inspired by a variation from The Sleeping Beauty.[15] Poulenc's biographer Henri Hell finds the score ""irresistibly evoking the art of Domenico Scarlatti"".
The complete ballet score comprises an overture followed by eight movements. The second (Chanson dansée), fourth (Jeu) and seventh (Petite chanson dansée) contain parts for unseen chorus. The published score stipulates a minimum of twelve singers (four sopranos, four tenors, four baritones), although it also seems to indicate that at the premiere there was only one voice to each part.[n 5] When Poulenc revised the score he made the vocal parts optional.[17]

Ouverture[edit]
The overture begins quietly, in 4/8 time in C major with a slow duet, marked tranquillo, for flute and bass clarinet. After about one minute the rest of the orchestra enters, the key changes to E major and the tempo to allegro vivace.[18] After several changes of time signature the overture ends with a reprise, at a faster tempo, of the opening theme.[19] The playing time is about 3m 30s.[20]

Rondeau[edit]
After a three bar introduction marked ""very slow"", the Rondeau switches to an energetic allegro molto in F major. The movement is dominated by a theme for trumpet which recurs throughout. The central section, marked ""très calme"", is quieter and slower. The boisterous first theme returns to round off the movement.[21]

Chanson dansée[edit]
""Chanson dansée"": text and translation
Men's voices only.





Qu'est-ce qu'Amour, 
le connais-tu, Grégoire? 
Qu'est-ce qu'Amour, 
dis-moi, le connais-tu?
Tra la la la la.
L'Amour est un chat
qui te guette et t'attrapera. 
L'Amour est un chat
qui t'attrapera.
A bon chat bon rat,
je sais/tu peux boire
Les chats et les Amours
aiment à folâtrer,
et sitôt qu'on les flatte
font patte de velours
Buveurs gardez-vous de la patte, 
de la patte de l'amour.
L'Amour est un chat
qui t'attrapera.




What is Love?
Do you know, Grégoire?
What is Love –
Tell me: do you know?
Tra-la-la-la-la!
Love is a cat 
that is watching you, and will catch you.
Love is a cat
that will catch you.
Tit for tat!
I know how/you can drink.
Cats and Loves
like to sport,
and when we pet them
they become velvet-pawed.
Drinkers, beware of
Love's paw.
Love is a cat 
that will catch you.




This movement is the first of the three choral sections in the original version of the ballet; it is for male voices with orchestral accompaniment. It begins quietly, with a theme marked ""quieto"", which in its five bars switches between 4/8 and 6/8 time. This is followed by a strongly rhythmic song for male voices, beginning in 2/4 time in D major, with a later interlude where the key switches to D-flat. The original theme returns to conclude the movement.[22]

Adagietto[edit]
The plaintive melancholy of the Adagietto finds Poulenc at his most affecting, in the view of the analyst Paul Horsley. It is dominated by a gentle oboe theme in its outer sections, and unlike much of the score it does not have frequent changes of key or time signatures.[23] Milhaud wrote of this movement, ""I know of no other music that touches me so intimately, so completely.""[24] In the 1950s Poulenc commented, ""The 'Adagietto' must be played without romantic pathos. In this ballet nobody falls in love for life, they have sex! Let's just leave it there.""[25] The initial mood of wistful charm – ""doucement mélancolique"" according to the score – is briefly interrupted by a louder and more emphatic section for a few bars, before the music becomes calm again, leading to a quiet close.[26]

you have chosen.
My darling, if you love me
kiss me again.
My daughter, you have to marry 
and that without further delay.
I have four daughters to marry.
I have filled my whole loft.




This is the first of the two choral movements for female and male voices. The words are those of a father hoping to marry off his four daughters, and the questions the daughters ask him about picking a husband. The movement is marked ""presto"", and switches throughout between 5/4, 4/4 3/4 and 2/4 time.[27]

Rag-Mazurka[edit]
The movement begins ""presto"" in 3/8 time, switches to 6/8 and then 9/8, with a later rapid succession of time signatures, including changes from 2/4 to 4/4 to 5/4 and 6/4 within seven bars. Towards the end of the movement the perpetuum mobile halts and is replaced with a conclusion marked ""très calme"".[28] Horsley comments that although the movement reflects the fashion for jazz in 1920s Paris, ""most listeners will hear more of Paris here than Scott Joplin"". As for the mazurka of the outer sections, it is ""a long way from Chopin’s piano works of this genre"".[24] At more than six minutes' duration this is the longest section of the ballet.[20]

Andantino[edit]
The conductor Norman Del Mar comments that despite the marking, this movement is closer to allegretto if taken at the composer's quite brisk metronome mark. The music, which refers back to the rondeau in its material, veers between what Del Mar calls ""gentle ingenuousness"" and ""rumbustious moments"".[29] Towards the end of the movement the music becomes very loud, the brass predominating, but the closing bars, led by the woodwind are marked ""très calme"" before a final emphatic chord for the brass and lower strings.[30]

I have a pretty laurel,
a pretty, French laurel.
Who would like my laurel?
Whom shall I give it to?
I prefer
a bouquet of wallflowers
a bouquet of freshly-cut wallflowers.
Is that orange blossom?
I have only a beautiful laurel.
I have no wallflowers.
A bouquet of wallflowers
covered in dew.
And it is the laurel
that I want to give you.
Take my beautiful laurel.
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!
Ah! Give me a fine bouquet!
Alas, I have no wallflowers.
My pretty laurel,
Would you like a necklace
of nasturtiums? A pretty necklace
that I have covered with kisses?
If you give me
the bouquet I ask for
I will see if I
can marry you
It is at St Matthew's
that we will be married,
if you give me
the bouquet of wallflowers.
And if I give you a bouquet
– a bouquet of wallflowers
do you promise me
you will kiss me on the cheek?
I will give you
what you ask me,
then at St Matthew's
we will be married.
It's  at Saint Matthew's
that we will marry,
give me that wallflowers
for our marriage.
Long live beautiful May,
the month of the wallflower!




In the second of the two choral sections for female and male voices the men woo the women offering laurels as a present; the women insist on bouquets of wallflowers before they will accept the men.[31] The movement is marked ""moderato non troppo"". As in other movements, there are several changes of time signature, but 4/4 predominates.[31]

Final[edit]
The finale is marked presto, at minim=108, a tempo so fast that Del Mar judges it barely playable. It is, he says, ""virtuoso writing and needs spectacular playing"".[32] A short section in the middle of the finale is more relaxed, but the tempo increases again and the initial theme returns at the same high speed as before to conclude the piece.[33]

Ballet[edit]
Bronislava Nijinska (1908 photograph)
Marie Laurencin, who created the original decor and costumes
Like the music, the choreography of Les biches is neoclassical. In an article about Les biches written in 1930, Frederick Ashton wrote, ""the whole ballet is new, and yet it is, at the same time, composed entirely of classical movement with a new expression.""[34] In The International Encyclopedia of Dance Gunhild Oberzaucher-Schüller writes that the Les biches was influenced by the legacy of the 19th-century choreographer Marius Petipa, given a modern twist by Nijinska:

Taking the classical repertory of steps as her starting point but using an inventive port de bras, flexed arms, a new kind of pas de bourrée, variations of épaulements and pointe, and asynchronous movements of the torso and legs, she developed new possibilities for classical technique. The work was a triumph for Nijinska, who viewed it as a twentieth-century equivalent of Les Sylphides.[34]
While Nijinska was creating the choreography, she worked out her Hostess role on Ninette de Valois, who was in the corps.[35] Lydia Sokolova later recalled that ""when we did Les biches, and she created the hostess for herself, she improvised mostly. That was the trouble with Bronia. If she suddenly felt she wanted to pull her face this way or that way, she'd do it. She wouldn't leave it as the dance was arranged, she would put in this extra thing, or a little thing with her feet"".[36] Clement Crisp describes the ballet as a ""delicious piece"", noting the ""cunningly different ports de bras, the freshness of use of the classical dance, the clarity of texture in the movement all make it a delight"", and contends that the soundness of the choreography have contributed the lasting popularity of the work.[37]
The preface to the published score states: ""The action passes in a large, white drawing room with just one piece of furniture, an immense blue sofa. It is a warm summer afternoon and three young men are enjoying the company of sixteen lovely women. Just as in 18th-century prints, their play is innocent in appearance only.""[38] At the premiere the sofa was a magnificent piece of furniture which the Grand Théâtre de Monte Carlo borrowed from the grand casino next door.[39] In a letter to Diaghilev Poulenc wrote ""Nijinska is really a genius. Listen to this: having decided that the sofa is a 'star', just as she herself is, she is making it dance throughout the Game"".[40]
The work comprises an overture and eight successive tableaux depicting, in Moore's words, ""various scenes of coquetry and seduction"".[1] The critic of Le Temps,  Henry Malherbe, wrote after the ballet was first given in Paris that in this piece ""atmosphere replaces action"": in the absence of a plot the composer was free to present a ballet that ""does not express anything precise and logical, other than a succession of characters that are pleasing to watch.""[41] His fellow critic, Raoul Brunei, described the piece as ""a choreographic fantasy whose meaning is not very clear.""[1] Moore gives the last word on the plot to the English dancer Lydia Sokolova, a member of the company in the premiere: ""There was no story to Les biches – it was far too chic to have anything so obvious"".[1]
Not only did the ballet have no plot:  its characters were not given names, although commentators have frequently invented them. The original programme listed the scenes and participants thus:[16]

Lydia Sokolova as the Hostess in a 1925 revival of Les biches
Companies such as the Royal Ballet that have revived Nijinska's ballet have maintained the anonymity of the characters.[42] Although not labelled in Nijinska's production, the main characters have come to be known by descriptive titles. They are:

The Hostess, in party attire with pearl necklace and a long cigarette holder (originally danced by Nijinska).[43]
Three male athletes dressed for rowing or bathing.
""La garçonne"", or ""the girl in blue"" or ""the page boy"": a sexually ambiguous figure played by a ballerina dressed in a boy's costume of blue velvet, who dances a pas de deux with one of the athletes.[44][n 6] The role was originally danced by Vera Nemtchinova.
""The grey girls"": two young women whose interactions suggest they are a lesbian couple.[44]
Rondeau[edit]
The tableau is danced by the twelve female members of the corps de ballet, dressed in identical pink frocks and ostrich-feathered head-dresses. They form lines, circles, groups, and finally one long line, and at the end six dancers exit on each side of the stage.

Chanson dansée[edit]
Three athletes dressed for rowing enter, with much macho posturing. They preen themselves to impress some of the women.

Adagietto[edit]
The androgynous figure often called la garçonne performs a slow dance, largely en pointe, watched by the women and the athletes.[n 6] Towards the end one of the athletes dances with la garçonne and kneels to kiss her/his hand. They exit together.

Jeu[edit]
The women mill about. The sofa is turned around and some of the women conceal themselves behind it. The garçonne and the athlete cross the stage engrossed in each other. The remaining two athletes dance and then lean against the sofa. The women emerge from hiding and pursue them.

The Hostess enters the empty stage and performs a virtuoso solo dance (with intricately rhythmic steps, described by the ballet critic Jan Parry as ""a fiendish tongue-twister for the feet"").[45][n 7] The two athletes enter and preen themselves before her; she flirts openly with them and the three dance off, with the athletes in pursuit of the hostess.

Andantino[edit]
The garçonne and the first athlete dance together. They end in a tight embrace.

Chanson dansée[edit]
The girls in grey dance together. Towards the end of their dance they look at each other face on and then exit on opposite sides of the stage

Final[edit]
The finale features all the dancers, first the corps, who then dance off as the principals enter. The ballet ends with the hostess dancing with her two athletes, the first athlete with the garçonne, and the girls in grey dancing separately.

Revivals[edit]
The ballet was staged in Paris by the Ballets Russes, at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, on 26 May 1924, just over four months after the Monte Carlo premiere. Diaghilev persuaded André Messager to conduct,[47] greatly to the composer's pleasure as he had been disappointed by the conducting of Édouard Flament at the premiere.[48] The cast was unchanged. As at Monte Carlo, the performance had what Hell describes as a triumphant reception.[49] The critics were mostly enthusiastic, with the exceptions  of Adolphe Boschot, who thought it a caricature, Emile Vuillermoz, who thought the music monotonous,[50] and Olin Downes, for The New York Times, who declared the piece ""pretentious and artificial"" and the music ""the last word in insipidity"".[51] Those who praised the work included Cocteau, Malherbe, Louis Laloy, Boris de Schlözer, and the correspondent of The Times, who judged the choreography ""ingenious"" and the score ""full of irresistible good spirits and delicious tunes"".[50][52]
Diaghilev took the ballet to London in 1925. There was some speculation beforehand that the official theatre censor, the Lord Chamberlain, might ban the piece for its suggestions of unconventional sexuality, but a licence was granted to perform it, and it was given at the Coliseum, under the title The House Party. The London theatre critic of The Times was tepid about the music, the choreography and the designs,[53] and did not mention – as the highly favourable review in The Manchester Guardian did – the enthusiasm with which the public had greeted the piece.[54] The cast was largely the same as at the premiere, but Anton Dolin replaced Anatole Wilzak as Vera Nemtchinova's partner in the Andantino.[55]
Wassily de Basil's Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo included Les biches in its repertoire in the mid-1930s.[56] Nijinska staged the work, as The House Party, for the Markova-Dolin Ballet in 1937; Alicia Markova took the part of Nemtchinova and Anton Dolin that of Anatole Wilzak, and Diana Gould was among the cast as the Hostess.[57] In the late 1940s the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas revived the work;[58] Nijinska, as the company's chief choreographer, supervised the revival.[59] The company included Les biches in its London seasons and gave the New York premiere of the piece in 1950; the company included Marjorie Tallchief as the garçonne and George Skibine as the leader of the three athletes. In The New York Times John Martin called it ""one of the masterpieces of the modern ballet"".[60]
In 1964 Frederick Ashton – by this time director of the Royal Ballet and a great admirer of the choreographer – invited Nijinska to re-create the ballet at the Royal Opera House, and he took close personal interest in the rehearsals and costume fittings.[61] Svetlana Beriosova danced Nijinska's old role of the hostess; Georgina Parkinson played the garçonne.[42] Subsequent performers of the role of the hostess in the Royal Ballet's production have included Deanne Bergsma, Monica Mason, Marguerite Porter, Darcey Bussell and Zenaida Yanowsky; the garçonne has been danced by Vergie Derman, Viviana Durante, Mara Galeazzi and Leanne Benjamin.[62] [n 8]
In France, Les biches was taken into the repertoire of two leading companies: Ballet Theatre Français performed it in the 1980s as part of a quadruple bill of Diaghilev ballets (with  L'Après Midi d'un Faune, Le Spectre de la rose and Pétrouchka).[64] The work entered the Paris Opera Ballet repertoire in 1991.[65]
Two new ballets have been created using Poulenc's score. In 1964 BBC television commissioned and broadcast Houseparty, choreographed by Peter Darrell, which took the original Nijinska scenario and sought to update it to reflect the mores of the mid 1960s.[66] In 2002 Thierry Malandain rechoreographed the ballet for the Malandain Ballet, Biarritz.[67]
The work has been less frequently staged in the US than other Diaghilev ballets.[68] The visiting Royal Ballet company presented it in New York in 1968; in 1982, Irina Nijinska, the choreographer's daughter, staged a revival for the Oakland Ballet, and the following year that production was seen in New York, given by the Dance Theater of Harlem. That staging was notable for including the three optional choral sections, sung by a solo soprano, tenor and baritone.[68] Le biches was featured in the 2009 ""Fall for Dance"" series in New York, danced by Ballet West.[46]

Recordings[edit]
Video[edit]
The Royal Ballet production of 1964 was filmed that year, with its original cast.[69] A performance of Nijinska's ballet given by the American Oakland Ballet company in 1984 has been published on DVD; it features Shirlee Reevie (hostess) and Erin Leedom (garçonne).[70]

Audio[edit]
The complete ballet score, including the choral sections, was first recorded by Varèse Sarabande in 1972, with Igor Markevitch conducting the Orchestre national de l'Opéra de Monte-Carlo.[71] It was subsequently recorded by EMI in 1981, with Georges Prêtre conducting the Philharmonia Orchestra and Ambrosian Singers. It was issued on LP,[72] and included in the 20-disc CD set ""Poulenc Integrale: Edition du 50e anniversaire 1963–2013"" issued in 2013 to mark the fiftieth anniversary of the composer's death.[73] A later recording by the Choeur de l`Orchestre de Paris and Orchestre de Paris, conducted by Semyon Bychkov, was released on the Philips label.[74]
The suite from the ballet has been recorded several times. Poulenc strongly favoured the version by the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra, conducted by Roger Désormière at the Maison de la Mutualité in Paris in June 1951 (Decca LXT 2720).[n 9] The recording was reissued on CD in 2003.[75] Later LP and CD versions of the suite have been recorded under the batons of French conductors including Louis Frémaux, Louis de Froment, Prêtre, Yan Pascal Tortelier, Stéphane Denève and Jean-Luc Tingaud, and non-French conductors including Charles Dutoit, Thierry Fischer, Anatole Fistoulari and Michael Gielen.[74]

(Redirected from Le bœuf sur le toit)
Le Bœuf sur le toitDesign for the Red-Haired Lady by Raoul DufyChoreographerJean CocteauMusicDarius MilhaudPremiere21 February 1920Comédie des Champs-Élysées, ParisGenreSurrealist ballet
Le Bœuf sur le toit (literally ""the ox on the roof""), Op. 58 is a short piece for small orchestra by the composer Darius Milhaud, written in 1919–20. Milhaud conceived the piece as incidental music for any one of the comic silent films of Charlie Chaplin, but it received its premiere as the music for a ballet staged by Jean Cocteau in February 1920.


Music[edit]
Milhaud said that he composed Le Bœuf sur le toit as ""fifteen minutes of music, rapid and gay, as a background to any Charlie Chaplin silent movie"".[1] The composer spent two years in Brazil in the French diplomatic service during the First World War, and was influenced by its music in his own compositions. There have been various explanations of the title: the musicologist James Harding mentions one, that the title was taken from the sign-board of a tavern, and another, that it is from an old Parisian legend of a man in a top-floor flat who insisted on keeping a calf, which grew into a large ox, too big to be removed. Milhaud himself said that it was the title of a Brazilian folk dance.[2]

Analysis[edit]
The musicologist Robert Matthew-Walker calls the work ""a rondeau-avec-reprises, a stylization of Rameau and Couperin"".[3] The music cycles through all the major keys and some minor ones.[4] Milhaud quoted extensively from Brazilian tunes. An analysis published in 2002 cites more than 20 pieces by 14 Brazilian composers referred to in the score.[5] The lively opening motif – Milhaud's own invention and not a borrowing[3] – recurs throughout:

Opening theme
It is interspersed with several subsidiary themes, principally a syncopated melody for strings, an elegant theme for woodwind and a brassy theme for trumpets. They are developed into a rhapsodic passage for strings, and another with a strong Latin-American flavour. As the work nears its conclusion the themes are brought together in an exuberant coda. The analyst Richard Whitehouse writes, ""The music is permeated by polytonal inflections that are a common feature of Milhaud's music in this period, giving it unexpected harmonic twists, while ensuring that the work's melodic and rhythmic appeal are never in doubt"".[4]

Instrumentation and arrangements[edit]
The original scoring calls for a chamber orchestra comprising two flutes, one doubling piccolo; one oboe; two B♭ clarinets; one bassoon; two horns in F; two trumpets in C; one trombone; one percussionist playing güiro,[n 1] tambourine, bass drum and cymbals; and strings.
Milhaud made several arrangements of the score: for violin and orchestra, violin and piano (with cadenza by his colleague from Les Six, Arthur Honegger), and two pianos.[3]

Ballet[edit]
Cocteau's 1920 production, décor by Raoul Dufy
Jean Cocteau persuaded Milhaud to let the music be used for a ballet. Cocteau wrote the scenario and the Fratellini clowns and the Medreno Circus provided the cast. The production was to have been designed by Guy-Pierre Fauconnel, but he died suddenly with his designs incomplete; Raoul Dufy took over.
The premiere was given on 21 February 1920 at the Comédie des Champs-Élysées in a programme that also included Francis Poulenc's overture Cocardes, the ballet Adieu New York by Georges Auric, three settings by Poulenc of verses by Cocteau, and Trois petites pièces montées by Erik Satie.[6] The conductor was Vladimir Golschmann.[3]
The action is described by Harding as ""pleasantly devoid of all meaning"".[7] The characters, mostly from the less respectable levels of Parisian society, are the Black Boxer, the Barman, the Jockey, the Black Billiard Player, the Red-Haired Lady, the Décolletée Lady, the Man in Evening Dress, and the Policeman. All wear cardboard heads two or three times life-size. The boxer finds his cigar drawing badly and the barman cuts it for him with a pistol shot. The bullet strikes down the billiard player. The jockey takes exception to the boxer's overtures to the red-headed lady and knocks him down, before joining the female customers in a tango. A police whistle is heard; the barman hides all evidence of alcohol and disguises the room as a milk-bar. A large policeman enters, smells the breath of the customers and dances a genial solo. The barman presses a button: an electric fan comes down from the ceiling and cuts off the policeman's head. He falls dead, and one of the female customers dances with his severed head, in a parody of Salome.[3] The barman replaces the head on the body of the policeman, who revives, but is confronted with a huge bill, several metres long, for everbody's drinks. Despite the liveliness of the music, the characters dance in slow motion, ""like deep-sea divers moving against the current"", in Harding's phrase.[7]
The ballet was well received in Paris, and Cocteau and Milhaud took it to London,[n 2] where Hugo Rumbold presented it under the title The Nothing Doing Bar. It was so successful at the London Coliseum – drawing five encores at the first night – that the management sent a touring company out with it.[9]
The ballet gave its name to a celebrated Parisian cabaret-bar, Le Bœuf sur le toit, which opened in 1921 and became a meeting-place for Cocteau and his associates. Milhaud was given life membership.[3]  He noted later that the piece had also given its name to bars in Brussels and New York.[1]

^ The score suggests a washboard as an alternative.

^ Milhaud's stay in London was important for his later music: he first encountered live jazz at the Hammersmith Palais, made a thorough study of the genre and drew on it for some of his later works.[3][8]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Cast of the first performance, 1919
La boîte à joujoux (The Toy-Box) is a ballet score by Claude Debussy, orchestrated from Debussy's piano score by André Caplet.[1]
In 1913 Debussy was approached by the artist and writer André Hellé, who had devised a ballet scenario from his children’s tale La boîte à joujoux. A children's theme appealed to Debussy, who was devoted to his own young daughter, Emma-Claude (known as ""Chouchou""), and had already written his suite Children's Corner for her. He composed the piano score, but the outbreak of the First World War caused the ballet to be postponed, and it was not staged until 1919, after the composer's death.[1]
The work, which plays for about half an hour, is in seven sections:[1]

Prelude: Le sommeil de la boite (The toy-box asleep)
Tableau 1: Le magasin de jouets (The toy shop)
Valse: Danse de la poupée (The doll's waltz)
Tableau 2: Le champ de bataille (The field of battle)
Tableau 3: La bergerie a vendre (The sheepfold for sale)
Tableau 4: Apres fortune faite (After making a fortune)
Epilogue
Of the toys in Hellé's box there are three principals, to each of whom Debussy gives a little leitmotiv: a toy soldier, a pretty doll, and a foolish and quarrelsome polichinelle. The soldier falls in love with the doll, but the polichinelle will not give her up. There is a fierce battle, and the soldier is wounded by the polichinelle, who then renounces the doll. She nurses the soldier, falls in love with him, and they marry and live happily ever after.[2]

1931 ballet by Dmitri Shostakovich

The Bolt (Russian: Болт), Op. 27, is a ballet music score written by Dmitri Shostakovich between 1930 and 1931 to a libretto by Victor Smirnov [ru]. The humorous and satirical full-length ballet in three acts and seven scenes was choreographed by Fyodor Lopukhov and premiered on 8 April 1931 at the State Academic Theatre of Opera and Ballet in Leningrad. It was not performed again until 2005, when a two-act choreography by Alexei Ratmansky was performed at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow.


Plot[edit]
The ballet is an ironic tale of slovenly work in a Soviet factory. The lazy Lyonka hates work and together with a local priest and anti-Soviet plotter he plans to sabotage the machinery by putting a bolt in it. Their plan is foiled by a group of Young Communists.

Instrumentation[edit]
Woodwinds: piccolo, 2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 B♭ clarinets, E♭ clarinet (doubling bass clarinet), 2 bassoons, double bassoon
Brass: 6 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, 1 tuba
Percussion: timpani, triangle, tambourine, snare drums, cymbals, bass drum, gong, glockenspiel, xylophone
Strings: violins, violas, cellos, double basses
Banda in Finale: E♭ cornet, 2 B♭ cornets, 2 trombones, 8 saxophones (2A,2T,2Bar,2B)

Reception[edit]
The premiere was the only performance for 74 years, as the audience jeered it and the critics upbraided it for its un-Soviet intentions. Along with his other ballets The Limpid Stream and The Golden Age, the work was banned by the authorities after Shostakovich's first denunciation in 1936. He subsequently put parts of it in his other music.

The waspish and delightfully colourful score bowls along like a children’s cartoon-film, every number full of drama and parody and fine take-offs of serious and popular music of every kind. Among the highlights are the opening scene when the workers gather in the morning for their physical fitness class before hitting the conveyor belts, the appearance of pompous and opinionated officials and bureaucrats, a ridiculous church-going episode, and the exciting scene when the sabotage-conspiracy nearly succeeds and is only foiled at the last moment. There are also plenty of numbers which mimic the whirling and hammering sounds of modern factory machinery.[1]
— Gerard McBurney
Suite[edit]
Shostakovich extracted a suite from the ballet, Op. 27a, with eight movements:

Overture (Introduction)
The Bureaucrat (Polka)
The Drayman's Dance (Variations)
Kozelkov's Dance with Friends (Tango)
Intermezzo
The Dance of the Colonial Slave-Girl
The Appeaser
General Dance and Apotheosis

Carmen is a ballet created by Roland Petit and his company 'Les Ballets de Paris' at the Prince's Theatre in London on 21 February 1949, which has entered the repertory of ballet companies in France and around the world.[1]


Background[edit]
This ballet is in five scenes and represents a striking admixture of classical ballet, Spanish-style movement, mime, and freshly invented dramatic dance action.[2] It opened ""scandalously and brilliantly, with the fabulously sexy Zizi Jeanmaire in the title role"" in London and has been regularly performed ever since.[3] The original designs and costumes were by Antoni Clavé. The music is taken from the 1875 opera of the same name by Georges Bizet, arranged and re-orchestrated by Tommy Desserre. The scenario is based on the 1845 novella by Prosper Mérimée. The principal roles were created for Petit's wife-to-be Zizi Jeanmaire (Carmen), Roland Petit (Don José) and Serge Perrault (Le Toréador). Over 5,000 performances of the work were given around the world over its first 50 years,[1] and is considered to be the most frequently performed of ballets based on Bizet's opera.[3]

Synopsis[edit]
The first scene is set in a street in Seville (Sevilla), Spain, where the dancing of a crowd is interrupted by a girl being chased by Carmen. Their fight is only stopped by the arrival of Don José, who assists Carmen's defeated opponent. As he is about to arrest Carmen he is struck by her allure and arranges an assignation for later. That evening in the tavern Don José enters and dances a zapateado to the music of the habanera. Carmen next appears and dances, ending at Don José's feet; he lifts her up and they go up to the bedroom. The customers dance and when Carmen and Don José return they join in before José wraps Carmen in his cape and they go off.
The third scene is in Carmen's bedroom. After a passionate pas de deux, three of Carmen's friends come in and invite her to go outside. At night in the street, Carmen, Don José and the friends prepare to rob a passer-by. Using a dagger Carmen has given him, Don José stabs a man, and after the women have taken his purse, they all flee.
The final scene is set outside the bull-ring where girls await the arrival of their hero, the toreador. He enters and greets them but is fascinated by the indifference shown by Carmen. José enters and notices their looks. The toreador moves into the arena whereupon Don José threatens Carmen, and in a fight to the death he overcomes her. As she dies, hats are tossed from the bull-ring to land at his feet.[6]

Recordings[edit]
Of performances captured on film, two feature the title role creator Zizi Jeanmaire; in one version from 1960 Don José is danced by Roland Petit and another (from 1980) has Mikhail Baryshnikov in that role. A Paris recording from 2005 features Clairemarie Osta and Nicolas Le Riche.

Catarina ou la Fille du bandit is a ballet in three acts and four scenes, with libretto and choreography by Jules Perrot and music by Cesare Pugni. The libretto is based on an incident in the life of the Italian painter Salvator Rosa. The work was first presented by the Ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre on 3 March 1846 in London, England, with Lucile Grahn (as Catarina, leader of the bandits), Louis-François Gosselin (as Salvator Rosa), and Jules Perrot (as the Lieutenant Diavolino).

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Chant du Rossignol (English: Song of the Nightingale), as it was published in 1921,[1] is a poème symphonique by Igor Stravinsky adapted in 1917 from his 1914 opera The Nightingale.


Opera[edit]
Stravinsky's first opera, The Nightingale was based on Hans Christian Andersen's 1843 fairy tale of the same name and was set to a Russian-language libretto in three acts told from the point of view of a fisherman. The poème symphonique derives its material mostly from the latter two acts, which were completed in 1914 after Stravinsky had established himself as a ballet composer and five years after he had completed the first act. He was in fact unsure about returning to The Nightingale at all, and this doubt may have led him to create the purely instrumental poème symphonique; in his autobiography he writes: 

I reached the conclusion — very regretfully, since I was the author of many works for the theatre — that a perfect rendering can be achieved only in the concert hall, because the stage presents a combination of several elements upon which the music has often to depend, so that it cannot rely upon the exclusive consideration which it receives at a concert. I was confirmed in this view when two months later, under the direction of ... [Ernest] Ansermet, Le Chant du Rossignol was given as a ballet by Diaghilev at the Paris Opera.[2]
Premiere of the poème symphonique[edit]
The work had its first performance on December 6, 1919, in Geneva, conducted by Ernest Ansermet at the Orchestre de la Suisse Romande.[3] It was met with criticism, much like that of The Rite of Spring. Stravinsky's nontraditional use of dissonance and instruments was unwelcome in later performances of the piece as well. It is possibly due to this public reaction that he then let Diaghilev turn it into a ballet.

Structure[edit]
The Chant is divided into four movements of varying length, which follow a non-linear, episodic structure. The music is taken from acts II and III. The movement list is as follows:[4]

Presto — Andantino — Tempo IMarche chinoise (Chinese March). {{music|quarter}} = 72 — {{music|quarter}} = 108 sempreChant du rossignol (Song of the Nightingale). Cadenza — Adagio — Presto — VivaceJeu du rossignol mécanique (The Mechanical Nightingale). Moderato — Sempre {{music|quarter}} = 60 — Molto ritmico — Pianissimo — Tranquillo
Premiere as a choreographed ballet[edit]

Productions[edit]
The piece's ballet debut occurred on February 2, 1920, at the Théâtre National de l'Opéra in Paris. The choreography was by Leonid Massine and designs by Henri Matisse. This also was met with some skepticism; Stravinsky himself was not entirely pleased. ""I had destined Le Chant du Rossignol for the concert platform, and a choreographic rendering seemed to me to be quite unnecessary,"" he says later in his autobiography.[2]
Stravinsky agreed to do a revival of the ballet in 1925.  Originally, the choreography was to be Massine's, but when that fell through, Diaghilev chose one of his newest students, George Balanchine, to choreograph the ballet.  This is when Stravinsky first met Balanchine, who later became his most important creative partner.
The Diaghilev and Stravinsky relationship weakened during Le chant du rossignol, as each liked to be the director in charge.  As Balanchine was allowed more of a role, however, it was clear that the Balanchine-Stravinsky relationship was a lasting one.  They had similar taste in art, music, and movement and lived to create.  Stravinsky and Balanchine continued as a team for several years, creating a number of famous ballets.

Plot[edit]
The ballet follows the main plot line of Stravinsky's Le rossignol, based on Andersen's The Nightingale. The first scene shows the Nightingale singing (or in this case, dancing) for the Emperor of China, who is pleased.  In the music, the song of the nightingale is chromatic and swooping, it sounds free and natural, like the song of a bird. The second scene introduces the gift of the mechanical nightingale from the Emperor of Japan. All are mesmerized by its song and ignore the real Nightingale, who flies away. The music here is short and clear, without the smooth runs of the ""real"" Nightingale and more sounds of a mechanical automaton.
In the third scene, the Emperor meets Death, due to illness and suffering from having lost the nightingale.  Then the Nightingale appears outside the Emperor's window and convinces Death to let the Emperor go.  The final scene shows the courtiers discovering that the Emperor is now well, although his Nightingale leaves once again, returning to nature.

Themes[edit]
The story's themes include the natural versus the artificial, with the real Nightingale juxtaposed with its mechanical replacement. This was not the first (or last) piece by Stravinsky centered on the character of a bird, nor was it his first fascination with a seemingly perfect machine, as records tell us Stravinsky often preferred the sound of a mechanical pianola, to the human (and inevitably imperfect) performance on a real piano.

Movement with music[edit]

Stravinsky was always specific about the use of movement with music.  He once said, ""I do not see how one can be a choreographer unless, like Balanchine, one is a musician first"", in praise of the famous choreographer who began working with Stravinsky for the revival of Le chant du rossignol.[2]  Balanchine was in fact a musician himself, and already a fan of Stravinsky's work.  He was immediately willing to take the challenge, saying, ""I learned the music well, and so ... when Diaghilev asked me to stage Stravinsky's ballet Le chant du rossignol, I was able to do it quickly"".[2]

Arrangements[edit]
Solo piano[edit]
Stravinsky also wrote a reduction of the whole symphonic poem for solo piano. As opposed to the original four-movement version for orchestra finished in 1917, the version for solo piano consists of three movements, with the full original material intact but rearranged into different movement division.[5] The movement list is as follows:

La fête au palais de l'empereur de Chine (Celebration in the Chinese Emperor's Palace). Presto — Andantino — Allegro — Marche chinoiseLes deux Rossignols (The Two Nightingales). Cadenza — Adagio — Presto — Vivace — Jeu du Rossignol mécanique. Moderato — Pochissimo più largo. Maestoso — LarghettoMaladie et guérison de l'empereur de Chine (The Chinese Emperor's Illness and Recovery). Molto ritmico — Marche funèbre — Larghetto
The piece was published by Hawkes & Son in 1927.[5]

Recording[edit]
Stravinsky did not record the music during his extensive recording sessions for Columbia Records, other than a 1932 reduction for violin and piano of Airs du rossignol and Marche chinoise only, recorded in 1933 with Samuel Dushkin on violin.[6]  However, Fritz Reiner and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra recorded the ballet for RCA Victor in ""Living Stereo,"" a pioneering process using triple track tape recorders and three microphones, in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.  It was among RCA's first recordings to be released in stereo, in 1958.

Ballet by Darius Milhaud
La Création du mondeThe Creation of the WorldDarius Milhaud in 1923.ChoreographerJean BörlinMusicDarius MilhaudBased onAfrican folk mythologyPremiere25 October 1923 (1923-10-25)Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, ParisOriginal ballet companyBallets suédois
La Création du monde, Op. 81a, is a 15-minute-long ballet composed by Darius Milhaud in 1922–23 to a libretto by Blaise Cendrars, which outlines the creation of the world based on African folk mythology. The premiere took place on 25 October 1923 at Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris.


Background[edit]
It was in London in 1920 that Milhaud discovered jazz.[1] On a trip to the United States in 1922, Darius Milhaud heard ""authentic"" jazz on the streets of Harlem,[2] which left a great impact on his musical outlook. It was like nothing he had heard before. He wrote ""against the beat of the drums, the melodic lines crisscrossed in a breathless pattern of broken and twisted rhythms.""[1] Using jazz elements, the following year he finished composing La Création du monde, which was cast as a ballet in six continuous parts.[2] The work was commissioned by the Ballets suédois, a ballet company which was contemporary to Diaghilev's Ballets Russes.[3] The company was very influential in the early 1920s, staging five seasons in Paris and touring continually.
The ballet reflects both the ideal of the aesthetic of Les six to combine popular forms of art and a centuries-old French penchant for exotica. Milhaud was very susceptible to all kinds of influences, but it was a different type of exotica that drew him. He was in the Paris of Le jazz hot, singer Josephine Baker, Pablo Picasso's paintings, and the sculptures inspired by African masks.[3]  During the early '20s, African (and Afro-American) fashion was sweeping Paris, and this ballet may have been Ballets suédois' attempt to follow the trend.[3] Les Six frequently socialized at the Gaya Bar, where Milhaud liked to hear Jean Wiener play “negro music” in a popular style. During the jazz age in Paris this music was often labeled “le tumulte noir (the black noise).”[4]
When Milhaud first heard an American jazz band in London (1920), he was reportedly so captivated that he took off to New York City to spend time in clubs and bars, visit Harlem and mingle with jazz musicians.[3] After returning to France, Milhaud began to write in what he called a jazz idiom. He chose to color his music with bluesy turns of harmony and melody, swinging climaxes, and stomping rhythms.[3] Jazz influences appear in many of his compositions, but this ballet was the first opportunity to express his new passion; even the instrumental grouping draws on his memories of New York City. ""In some of the shows,"" Milhaud noted, ""the singers were accompanied by flute, clarinet, trumpets, trombone, a complicated percussion section played by just one man, piano and string quartet.""[3]
Leonard Bernstein summarized the piece best: “The Creation of the World emerges not as a flirtation but as a real love affair with jazz.” [4]

Reception[edit]
At the time, La Création du monde was more a succès de scandale than a true success.[3]  The ballet costumes designed by Fernand Léger (who also created the stage sets) worked well visually, but were difficult to dance in; the costumes were heavy and too inflexible to allow the dancers to move freely.[3]
The costumes and sets from the original performance of La Création du monde still survive in museums and galleries, while the music has taken its place in the concert repertoire. The choreography is revived occasionally out of curiosity.[3]

Instrumentation[edit]
The score is written for a small orchestra of eighteen instrumentalists: 2 flutes, (1 also plays piccolo), oboe, 2 clarinets, bassoon, alto saxophone, french horn, 2 trumpets, trombone, piano, 3 timpani + 2 small timpani, 1 percussionist (snare drum, tenor drum, tambourin, pedal bass drum + cymbal attachment, cymbals, tambourine, wood-block and cowbell), 2 violins, violoncello, double bass. The alto saxophone part appears in the score where a viola part would generally be.[5] Milhaud also made a version for piano and string quartet (Op. 81b).[3]

1886 ballet by Louis Mérante and André Messager
This article is about ballets based on la Fontaine's fable. For the original fable, see The Two Pigeons.


Les Deux PigeonsSketches of the original ballet that appeared in the Paris Journal Amusant]]ChoreographerLouis MéranteMusicAndré MessagerBased onThe Two Pigeons by Jean de La FontainePremiere18 October 1886 (1886-10-18)Paris Opéra
Les Deux Pigeons is a ballet originally choreographed in two acts by Louis Mérante to music by André Messager. The libretto by Mérante and Henri de Régnier is based on the fable The Two Pigeons by Jean de La Fontaine. The work was first performed at the Paris Opéra on 18 October 1886.[1] The premiere cast included Rosita Mauri as Gourouli and Marie Sanlaville as Pépio.[1]
Frederick Ashton later created a new ballet to Messager's music under the title The Two Pigeons.


Background[edit]
The score is dedicated to Camille Saint-Saëns, whose influence helped gain Messager the commission for the ballet, following three ballets which the younger composer had written for the Folies Bergère, Fleur d’oranger, Vins de France and Odeurs et Parfums. Les Deux pigeons was first performed on the same evening as a performance of La Favorite.
Messager introduced the ballet to London in 1906, with choreography by François Ambroisiny and a shortened score by Messager himself, who also conducted.[2] He used this shortened version when the piece was revived at the Paris Opéra in 1912,[3] and it was published as a final version. A one-act version was choreographed by Albert Aveline at the Opéra in 1919 and it was not until 1942 that the role of Pépio was finally danced by a man.
The discovery of the shortened score used at Covent Garden prompted Ashton to make his own version of the ballet, set in Paris at the time of the music's composition. As the 1912 version didn't provide a return to the opening scene at the end, John Lanchbery constructed a closing reconciliation scene from earlier music and a passage from Messager's operetta Véronique, as well as revising the orchestration in favour of a richer sound.
Ashton's version in two acts was premiered on 14 February 1961 at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, with Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable. As well as being performed regularly by the Royal Ballet touring company, the ballet has also been staged by several other dance companies around the world, including CAPAB and Australian Ballet.[2]

The plot[edit]
Jules Chéret's poster for the two-act production
In the original scenario, set in 18th-century Thessaly, the hero Pépio (danced then by a woman) is discontented with life at home and with the company of his fiancée Gourouli. Their relationship is symbolised by their pas de deux at the start in imitation of two pigeons they have been observing, quarrelling with small irritated movements of the head and then coming together to make up. When a group of gypsies visit their village, Pépio is seduced by the energetic czardas that they dance and flirts with the dusky Djali, eventually leaving his love behind to join in their wanderings. Gourouli's grandmother advises her to follow him disguised as a gypsy, thus providing the ballerina with a dual role. In the first act she had appeared in a pink wig; in the scene at the camp Rosita Mauri danced with her own long black hair unbound and streaming about her.[4] By such means, this elemental Gourouli makes all the men fall in love with her, and she bribes one of them to make Pépio's life miserable. When a storm breaks, the gypsies rob Pépio and flee. He returns home chastened and must ask for forgiveness.
Ashton's version of the ballet is set in Paris at the time of the music's composition with anonymous leading roles (Young Man and Young Girl). At the start, a French painter is revealed trying to paint a restless model, his lover, who is sitting on an ornate cast-iron chair. The session is interrupted by the entry of the model's friends and his responsiveness to other female company underlines his restless spirit. A troupe of gypsies that he sees through the garret window, misunderstanding a gesture of his, now crowd in and a quarrel develops over possession of the chair between the model and a hot-blooded Carmen with whom the painter is flirting. Perceiving that they are not welcome, the gypsy leader leaves the studio and the painter dashes off to join them, bewitched by their unfamiliar and seemingly exotic lifestyle. However, his intrusion into their community is resented and he is thrown out of the encampment. Returning to the lover he had left behind, they are reconciled and sit together on the ornate chair that has dominated the room.[5]
Two live pigeons are used to represent the lovers; they have a theme of their own in the music. Seen together during the first act, while the artist and his lover dance together, the young man's dissatisfaction and temporary desertion of the girl are represented by one pigeon flying alone off stage before the interval. The painter's return in the next act is prompted by a pigeon coming to land on his shoulder. When the lovers are reunited both pigeons perch above them on the chair.

Recordings[edit]
In 1991 at the Brangwyn Hall, Swansea, the Orchestra of Welsh National Opera conducted by Richard Bonynge were recorded by Decca in Messager's 1906 score.[6] John Lanchbery recorded his version of the ballet music for EMI in 1984 with the Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra.
A suite of movements from the ballet (Entrée des tziganes, Scène et pas de deux des pigeons, Thème et variations, Danse hongroise, Finale) has been recorded several times, for example by the Orchestre du Théâtre des Champs-Elysées conducted by Paul Bonneau (Ducretet Thomson – 255 C 087), Orchestre Colonne conducted by Jean Fournet (Pathe PDT135, 1947), the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden conducted by Hugo Rignold (HMV, C3778-9, 1948), the orchestra of the Opéra-Comique, Paris conducted by Richard Blareau (Decca, LX3093, 1952)[7][8] and the Orchestra of the Royal Opera House by Charles Mackerras (HMV, CLP1195, 1958).

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Estancia (Op. 8)[1] is the second ballet composed by Argentinian composer Alberto Ginastera premiered in 1952 commissioned by American writer Lincoln Kirstein. Ginastera took inspiration for the ballet's plot from the epic Martin Fierro by Argentine writer José Hernández, incorporating the nationalist themes and language into his musical score.[2] The ballet was created the same year the composer had made his acquaintance with American composer Aaron Copland.[3] The ballet began its life as a four-part orchestral suite in 1941[4] before being turned in a one-act ballet.[5]
The ballet form is approximately one hour in length and tells the story of the love between a boy living in the city and the daughter of a rancher. The girl finds the boy lacking in courage when compared to the gauchos. However, by the end of the ballet, he wins her over by outdancing the gauchos in a competition.


History[edit]
Ginastera's ballet was a commissioned project by Kirstein for the American Ballet Caravan, with choreography ostensibly provided by Russian choreographer George Balanchine. The ballet company had involved themselves in another Western-inspired ballet at the time, Copland's Billy the Kid (1938). While on tour in Argentina with the company, Copland met Ginastera and a deep friendship ensued.[2]
However, the ballet company disbanded in 1942, nullifying the opportunity for the ballet to be performed. Further, the onset of World War II stopped the project entirely and performance of the ballet would not occur until after the war in 1945. Kirstein had originally hoped to have the ballet performed as early as possible but the war effort and the company's dissolution stopped his plans.[citation needed]
As an interim solution, Ginastera extracted four dances from the ballet and created an orchestral suite for concert performance, with the final (""Malambo""), based on the Argentine dance style, being the most well-known of the four.[5][6]
Ultimately, the work was premiered. In 1952, the Colon Theater Ballet held the ballet's official premiere, with choreography supplied by the Russian choreographer Michel Borovsky. The lead dance role was performed by Enrique Lommi who is said to have asked for simpler footwork as the orchestra had begun to drown his sounds out.[citation needed]
In 2010, the New York City Ballet reconceptualized the work.[2][7] The work was choreographed by English choreographer Christopher Wheeldon with set design by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.

L'éventail de Jeanne (Jean's Fan) is a children's ballet choreographed in 1927 by Alice Bourgat and Yvonne Franck.
The music is a collaborative work by ten French composers, each of whom contributed a stylised dance in classic form:

Maurice Ravel (Fanfare)
Pierre-Octave Ferroud (Marche)
Jacques Ibert (Valse)
Alexis Roland-Manuel (Canarie)
Marcel Delannoy (Bourrée)
Albert Roussel (Sarabande)
Darius Milhaud (Polka)
Francis Poulenc (Pastourelle)
Georges Auric (Rondeau)
Florent Schmitt (Finale: Kermesse-Valse)
""Jeanne"" refers to a Parisian hostess and patroness of the arts, Jeanne Dubost, who ran a children's ballet school. In the spring of 1927 she presented ten of her composer friends with leaves from her fan, asking each of them to write a little dance for her pupils. The children were dressed in fairytale costumes and the décor was enlivened by a set designed with mirrors.
It was produced in private at Jeanne Dubost's Paris salon on 16 June 1927, with Maurice Ravel playing a piano transcription of the music.  It had its public premiere at the Paris Opera on 4 March 1929, with the ten-year-old Tamara Toumanova dancing the lead role. This was the first performance of Darius Milhaud's music there and he was so annoyed to debut with a trifling work that he boycotted the performance.
Excerpts have been recorded, particularly Ravel's Fanfare and Poulenc's Pastourelle. The first complete recording was made in 1984 by the Philharmonia Orchestra led by Geoffrey Simon.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


18th-century ballet by Jean-Georges Noverre


Costume and scene in Chinese Dance (1742) by François Boucher may have inspired Les Fêtes Chinoises.
Les Fêtes Chinoises is an 18th-century ballet by Jean-Georges Noverre (1727–1810). The exact date of the ballet's composition is unknown.[1]


Background[edit]
Noverre, 1807
Before Noverre there was no dance technique involved in ballets; such spectacles were loosely organized around a story or theme, but the dance movement itself was largely formal and ornamental, with only a very limited range of mime gestures to convey the action.[2] He used this new, revolutionary production as a response and a contrast to the ballets of the time. ""Noverre points out, this kind of performer is rare. He…thinks that the actor-dancer must rise to the challenge of translating a verbal description into stage action, that this involves not just performance, but interpretation.""[3][4][5]
The ballet designs were the fruit of Boucher's friendship with Jean Monnet, which had resulted in designs for Monnet at the Théâtre de la Foire de Saint Laurent ""as early as 1743.""[6] Le Nouveau Calendrier des spectacles de Paris described the scene of Les Fêtes Chinoises as ""an avenue ending in terraces and a flight of steps leading to a palace"" then changing to a public square decorated for a festival and continuing with subsequent scene shifts of which the Calendrier remarked ""M. Monnet has spared nothing that could possibly assist M. Noverre's rich imagination"".[2][7]

Plot summary[edit]
J. des Boulmiers, an eyewitness to a performance of Les Fêtes Chinoises wrote:[...] a public square decorated for a festival with, in the background, an amphitheatre on which are seated sixteen Chinese [and] thirty-two are seen on the gradins (stepped tiers) going through a pantomime. As the first group descends, sixteen further Chinese, both mandarins and slaves, come out of their habitations [...]. All these form eight rows of dancers who, rising and dipping in succession, imitate fairly well the billows of a stormy sea. All the Chinese, having descended, begin a character march.  There are a mandarin, borne in a rich palanquin by six white slaves, whilst two negros draw a chariot on which a young Chinese woman is seated. They are preceded and followed by a host of Chinese playing various musical instruments [...]. This march concluded, the ballet begins and leaves nothing to be desired either in the diversity or in the neatness of the figures. It ends in a contredanse of thirty-two persons whose movements trace a prodigious number of new and perfectly designed attitudes, which form and dissolve with the greatest of ease. At the end [...] the Chinese return to their place on the amphitheatre, which is transformed into a china cabinet. Thirty-two vases, which rise up, conceal [...] the thirty-two Chinese one saw before.[8][9] Considering that most performances (theatrical and ballet) before this took place in either the royal courts or in inn yards, taverns, or pubs, having that many people on the stage at one time was unheard of. However, Lincoln Kirstein adds that it ""consisted of dance pictures with little plot, incorporating elements of the real and ideal, including the exotic China of travelers and explorers and the fantastic Cathay of Rococo chinoiserie designers.""[1] Furthermore, the costumes were ""untraditional""—they were based on Roman armor and had Chinese embellishments on them.[8]
Paris production, 1754[edit]
Boucher, 1741
They were worked up into full-scale cartoons by Jean-Joseph Dumons, and woven nine times, first in 1743 and last in 1775, when their rococo pastorale galante would have begun to seem a bit stale.[10][11][12]

Reception[edit]
Les Fêtes Chinoises was Noverre's first great success. In a grudging journal entry the dramatist Charles Collé remarked in July 1754: ""This month, all Paris has flocked to a Chinese ballet, given at the Opéra Comique. I do not like ballets, and my aversion to dancing has greatly increased since all the theatres have become infected with ballets; but I must admit that this Chinese ballet is unusual and at least by its novelty and its picturesqueness it has earned a share of the applause it is given.""[13] On 1 July 1754, the Mercure de France observed that the ballet was mounted with extraordinary luxury and in August reported that ""the multitude flocked to see it with unprecedented furore.""[9]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



La Fille du Danube (The Daughter of the Danube) is a ballet in two acts and four scenes, choreographed by Filippo Taglioni to music by Adolphe Adam.

Marie Taglioni as the Daughter of the Danube (circa. 1836)
History[edit]
La Fille du Danube was choreographed and produced by Filippo Taglioni for his daughter, Marie Taglioni, the creator of the title role and was premièred on 21 September 1836 by the ballet of the Académie Royale de Musique, Paris. Like his 1832 ballet La Sylphide, La Fille du Danube focused on the romantic theme of a supernatural maiden, but with both inhibiting a different element - the Sylph is a maiden of the air, while the Daughter of the Danube is a maiden of the water.
The following year in 1837, Taglioni and his daughter travelled to St Petersburg, Russia where Marie Taglioni made her Russian debut in La Sylphide on the 6 September 1837 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kammeny Theatre. Her St Petersburg debut was a huge success, with the Russian balletomanes and critics becoming completely enchanted by the Italian ballerina. That same year, her father revived and restaged La Fille du Danube for Marie's benefit performance on the 20 December 1837 and the revival was a tremendous success. One critic wrote:

The ballet presented yesterday, La Fille du Danube, had a marvellous success. The balletmaster Mr Taglioni, the creator of the ballet, who produced it on our stage, was called for after the first and second acts. Mlle Taglioni was never so captivating as on this evening. The calls for her were endless; we lost count of them.[1]
Marie Taglioni performed in La Fille du Danube for the final time in St Petersburg in 1842, a week before her final performance in Russia.
La Fille du Danube was to be one of the two ballets by Filippo Taglioni to survive in Russia following the departures of both the balletmaster and his daughter from the country, the other being La Sylphide. In 1880, at the request of Tsar Alexander II, who had seen Marie Taglioni in the ballet, La Fille du Danube was revived by Marius Petipa for the Prima Ballerina, Ekaterina Vazem. For this revival, Petipa included new musical additions and revisions by Léon Minkus and the revival was premièred at the Imperial Bolshoi Kammeny Theatre on 24 February 1880 for Vazem's benefit performance. Vazem writes in her memoirs how she felt that the ballet was ""flat"", that the heroine's part was ""not the most effective"" and goes onto claim that ""the mounting of the ballet looked quite wretched"". However, she also writes that the premiere was met with much enthusiasm from the public:

For all the minuses of this production, however, the public, perhaps fascinated by the legend of the furore which Taglioni created in La Fille du Danube, came to the theatre in throngs.[2]

La Fille mal gardée (from French: The Wayward Daughter, literal translation: ""The Poorly Guarded Girl"" and also known as The Girl Who Needed Watching) is a comic ballet presented in two acts, inspired by Pierre-Antoine Baudouin's 1765 painting, La réprimande/Une jeune fille querellée par sa mère.[1] The ballet was originally choreographed by the Ballet Master Jean Dauberval to a pastiche of music based on fifty-five popular French airs. The ballet was premiered on 1 July 1789 at the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux in Bordeaux, France under the title Le ballet de la paille, ou Il n'est qu'un pas du mal au bien (The Ballet of Straw, or There is Only One Step from Bad to Good).
La Fille mal gardée is one of the oldest and most important works in the modern ballet repertory, having been kept alive throughout its long performance history by way of many revivals. The work has undergone many changes of title and has had no fewer than six scores, some of which were adaptations of older music.
Today La Fille mal gardée is normally presented in one of two different versions: many ballet companies feature productions which are derived from Alexander Gorsky's version to the music of Peter Ludwig Hertel, originally staged for the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow in 1903. Gorsky's version was almost entirely based on Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov's 1885 staging for the Imperial Ballet of St. Petersburg. The Petipa/Ivanov staging was itself based on Paul Taglioni's version to the music of Peter Ludwig Hertel, originally staged in 1864 for the Court Opera Ballet of the Königliches Opernhaus in Berlin. Modern audiences are perhaps most familiar with the production staged by Frederick Ashton for the Royal Ballet in 1960.
The appealing simplicity and the naïve familiarity of the action of La Fille mal gardée have lent it a popularity that has established it in the repertory of many ballet companies all over the world.


The origins of La Fille mal gardée[edit]
Pierre-Antoine Baudouin's painting Le reprimande/Une jeune fille querellée par sa mère.
La Fille mal gardée was the creation of Jean Dauberval, one of the greatest choreographers of his day. He was trained under the influential teacher Jean-Georges Noverre and is further distinguished as the teacher of Charles Didelot, known today as ""The Father of Russian Ballet"". Legend has it that Dauberval found his inspiration for La Fille mal gardée while in a Bordeaux print shop, where he viewed an engraving of Pierre-Antoine Baudouin's painting Le reprimande/Une jeune fille querellée par sa mère. The painting showed a girl in tears with her clothes disarrayed being berated by an old woman (presumably her mother) in a hay barn, while her lover can be seen in the background scurrying up the stairs to the safety of the loft. Allegedly[according to whom?] this quaint work of art amused Dauberval so much that he immediately set out to craft a suitable scenario for a ballet.
The ballet was first presented at the Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux in Bordeaux, France on 1 July 1789. Dauberval's wife, la danseuse Marie-Madeleine Crespé (known to history as Mme. Théodore), created the role of Lison (or Lise, as the character is known in modern versions), the danseur Eugène Hus created the role of Colin (or Colas), and Francois Le Riche created the role of the Widow Ragotte (now known as Widow Simone in modern versions).
The ballet's original title was Le ballet de la paille, ou Il n'est qu'un pas du mal au bien (""The Ballet of the Straw, or There is Only One Step from Bad to Good""). The work met with public success and proved to be Dauberval's most popular and enduring work.

The music[edit]
In the late 18th and early 19th centuries scores for ballets were often patchworks (or a pastiche) of popular airs derived from well-known dances, songs and/or operas. These scores were often arranged and adapted by either the theatre's director of music or by the lead violinist of the opera house's orchestra, who at the time also served as conductor (the separate role of orchestral conductor was not yet established).
The 1789 score for La Fille mal gardée was itself an arrangement of fifty-five popular French airs. The surviving orchestral parts of the 1789 score do not list a composer/arranger, and no extant contemporary account of the original production mentions a composer. It is possible that Dauberval himself arranged the score, for he certainly devised the ballet's scenario and was a competent violinist. If it was not his work, then it may have been one of the musicians employed by the theatre.

Revivals of Dauberval's original version[edit]
Announcement for the premiere of La Fille mal gardée at the Pantheon, London, 1791.
Two years after the premiere, Dauberval travelled to London to mount the work for the Ballet of the King's Pantheon Theatre, and for the occasion he changed the title of the ballet to La Fille mal gardée, as the ballet is now commonly known. For the first performance on 30 April 1791, Dauberval's wife Mme. Théodore reprised her role as Lise, while Dauberval's student, Charles Didelot danced Colas.
The 1789 score was loathed by the musicians of the Pantheon Theatre Orchestra. When the orchestral parts were rediscovered in 1959 by the ballet historian and musicologist Ivor Guest and the conductor John Lanchbery, they were found to be covered with comments ranging from the witty to the crude. In the original manuscript the title of the ballet was sprawled atop the pages. The lead violinist of the first London performance crossed out the title, and in its place wrote ""Filly-Me-Gardy"".
Eugène Hus, creator of the role of Colas, staged Dauberval's La Fille mal gardée in 1803 at the old Paris Opéra, the Salle de la rue de Richelieu, predecessor of the Salle Le Peletier. Prior to this production, Hus utilised the ballet's libretto in 1796 for a comic opera titled Lise et Colin, which was set to the music of Pierre Gaveaux.

Jean-Pierre Aumer's new version to the music of Hérold[edit]
Mme. Théodore Dauberval, creator of the role of Lise. Paris, 1761.
The choreographer Jean-Pierre Aumer, a student of Dauberval, continuously revised Hus's 1803 production throughout his career as ballet master at the Paris Opéra. He then travelled to Vienna in 1809 to mount the work for the Ballett des imperialen Hoftheater nächst der Burg.
On 17 November 1828, Aumer presented a completely new version of La Fille mal gardée at the Paris Opéra especially for the Ballerina Pauline Montessu. For this revival the composer Ferdinand Hérold created an adaptation of the original score of 1789. Hérold also borrowed many themes from the operas of such composers as Jean Paul Egide Martini and Gaetano Donizetti.

The Fanny Elssler pas de deux[edit]
In 1837, the great Austrian Ballerina Fanny Elssler made her debut at the Paris Opéra in Aumer's production of La Fille mal gardée. As was the custom of the time, a ballerina would commission new Pas and variations to be interpolated into already existing ballets for their own performances. Making use of the extensive archives in the Paris Opéra's library, the ballerina selected her favourite airs from Donizetti's extremely popular score for the opera L'elisir d'amore. The library's copyist Aimé-Ambroise-Simon Leborne assembled and orchestrated the music for her.
Elssler's Grand pas was resurrected by the musicologist and historian Ivor Guest for Ashton's 1960 production of La Fille mal gardée for the Royal Ballet.

Paul Taglioni's new version to the music of Hertel[edit]
The Italian choreographer Paul Taglioni, brother of the legendary Marie, was engaged as ballet master to the Court Opera Ballet of the Königliches Opernhaus in Berlin from 1852–1866. On 7 November 1864, Taglioni presented his own completely new staging of La Fille mal gardée under the title Das schlecht bewachte Mädchen (The Badly Guarded Girl). For this production Taglioni commissioned an entirely new score from the Königliches Opernhaus's resident composer of ballet music Peter Ludwig Hertel. This production premiered to a resounding success, and was retained in the company's repertory for many years.
In May 1876, the Italian ballerina Virginia Zucchi made her debut in Taglioni's production in Berlin. The celebrated ballerina triumphed in the role of Lise, revitalising the work with her expressive portrayal.

La Fille mal gardée in Russia[edit]
In Russia, La Fille mal gardée (Russian: Тщетная предосторожность) was staged for the first time by the Ballet Master Giuseppe Solomoni in 1800 for Michael Maddox's Petrovsky Theatre (the predecessor of the Bolshoi Theatre) in Moscow, a production that was later revised by Solomoni's successor Jean Lamiral in 1808. Both productions utilised the original pastiche score of 1789, perhaps in adaptations prepared for each respective staging.
The first production of La Fille mal gardée to be performed by the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet was staged by Jean Dauberval's student Charles Didelot, who performed the role of Colas in the London revival of 1791. Didelot—who served as Maître de ballet to the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres from 1801–1811 and from 1816–1837—presented his version of La Fille mal gardée on 2 October [O.S. 20 September] 1818 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, under the title La Précaution inutile, ou Lise et Colin (Vain Precaution, or Lise and Colin). The work was set to music by the composer Catterino Cavos.
A production of Jean-Pierre Aumer's 1828 version of La Fille mal gardée, set to the music of Hérold, was first staged in Russia at the Moscow Bolshoi Theatre in 1845 by the Balletmaster Irakly Nikitin. The great choreographer Jules Perrot—Premier Maître de ballet of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres from 1850–1859—staged his own version of Aumer's production for the company in 1854, and for this production added new music to the ballet by the composer Cesare Pugni. Perrot's staging was given for the last time in 1880 for a benefit performance for the Imperial Ballet's Premier danseur Pavel Gerdt.

Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov's revival[edit]
Virginia Zucchi as Lise in Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov's revival of La Fille mal gardée, St. Petersburg, 1885.
The great Italian ballerina Virginia Zucchi toured St. Petersburg in 1885, performing successfully in different works at various theatres throughout the Imperial capital. In August of that year Emperor Alexander III requested that the Imperial Theatre's director Ivan Vsevolozhsky invite Zucchi to perform with the Imperial Ballet. Zucchi agreed, and chose Paul Taglioni's 1864 version of La Fille mal gardée to the music of Hertel for her début. The director Vsevolozhsky was required to pay an extremely high price to obtain Hertel's score from Berlin, while Zucchi herself commanded large fees plus a benefit performance in her contract.
The production of La Fille mal gardée was staged jointly by the Imperial Ballet's Premier maître de ballet Marius Petipa and the company's régisseur and second ballet master Lev Ivanov, while Zucchi herself would assist with staging some of the dances she had known from Paul Taglioni's version. The production also incorporated dances from the Imperial Ballet's old production to the music of Hérold. The reasons for the joint staging by both Petipa and Ivanov are not entirely clear, though it may be due to the fact that Ivanov was needed to stage the numbers brought out from the old production of the ballet. Petipa was responsible for the setting of all of the new dances, and even commissioned the composer Ludwig Minkus to score music for two additional variations for Zucchi.
The production premiered under its traditional title in Russia La Précaution inutile (Vain Precaution) on 28 December [O.S. 16 December] 1885. Zucchi's performance as Lise instantly became a legend in Russia, where she was soon known as ""The Divine Virginia"". During the famous mimed scene known as ""When I'm Married"", contemporary accounts tell us that Zucchi's performance made such an impression that it brought many in the audience to tears. The ballerina was much celebrated for the famous Pas de ruban, for which Lise and Colas dance a pas elaborated by the use of ribbons, with Colas pretending to be a horse and Lise running along.
After Zucchi left the Imperial stage, Lev Ivanov mounted an abridged version of La Fille mal gardée for performances at the Imperial Theatre of Krasnoe Selo in the summer of 1888. The role of Lise was performed by the ballerina Alexandra Vinogradova, who reprised the role in October of that same year on the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre (principal theatre of the Imperial Ballet and Opera from 1886). This was the last performance of the ballet until 1894, when Ivanov again revived the ballet for the visiting German ballerina Hedwige Hantenbürg. Thereafter the work found a permanent place in the Imperial Ballet's repertory.
La Fille mal gardée proved to be a useful vehicle for the great ballerinas of the old Imperial stage, most notably Olga Preobrajenskaya, Anna Pavlova and Tamara Karsavina. For some time the renowned ballerina Mathilde Kschessinskaya did not allow any other danseuse to perform the role of Lise.
A feature of the Ivanov production was the use of live chickens on stage. One evening when Preobrajenskaya danced the role of Lise, her rival Kschessinskaya let all of the chickens out of their coops during her variation, with many of them landing in the orchestra pit and even on the laps of many of the musicians. Preobrajenskaya kept on dancing as if nothing happened.
The difficulties brought upon the Russian ballet as a result of the 1917 revolution caused a substantial number of works in the Imperial Ballet's repertory to cease being performed and eventually become lost. The Imperial Ballet's production of La Fille mal gardée was performed for the last time on 10 October [O.S. 27 September] 1917, only one month prior to the October Revolution, with the ballerina Elsa Vill as Lise.

Notation of the Imperial Ballet's production[edit]
As with many of the works that comprised the St. Petersburg Imperial Ballet's repertory at the turn of the 20th century, the Petipa/Ivanov/Hertel production of La Fille mal gardée was notated in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation by the company's régisseur Nicholas Sergeyev and his team of notators. Sergeyev brought these notations with him when he left Russia in 1917 and utilised them to mount such ballets as the Petipa/Ivanov Swan Lake, Petipa's The Sleeping Beauty, the Imperial Ballet's original 1892 The Nutcracker, the Petipa/Ivanov/Cecchetti Coppélia, and Petipa's definitive Giselle for the first time outside of Russia, primarily for the Royal Ballet.
Today all of these notations, including those for the Imperial Ballet's production of La Fille mal gardée, are part of a collection known as the Sergeyev Collection, which is today housed in the theatre collection of the Harvard University Library. In 2015 the choreographer and historian Sergei Vikharev staged a production of La Fille mal gardée for the State Ballet of Ekaterinburg that utilized the notation from the Sergeyev Collection. The production premiered on 15 May 2015 at the Ekaterinburg State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre.

La Fille mal gardée in the 20th century[edit]
Alexander Gorsky's revival[edit]
On 20 December [O.S. 7 December] 1903, an important revival of La Fille mal gardée premiered at the Imperial Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. This version was staged by Alexander Gorsky, a former danseur of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres who served as Premier maître de ballet of the Moscow troupe. Gorsky's 1903 version was based on the Petipa/Ivanov production that he learned during his career in St. Petersburg. Gorsky's version used much additional music added to the score of Hertel, including pieces by Cesare Pugni, Ludwig Minkus, Léo Delibes, Riccardo Drigo and Anton Rubinstein. It is this version of La Fille mal gardée that would eventually serve as the basis for nearly every production mounted in Russia, Europe and the Americas for many decades. Gorsky's version of the Grand pas de deux from the second act, loosely known as La Fille mal gardée pas de deux, is now a famous repertory excerpt on the gala and competition circuit, and is still performed regularly by the Vaganova School as part of their annual graduation performances at the Mariinsky Theatre.

Soviet-era productions[edit]

In 1930 the choreographers Asaf Messerer and Igor Moiseyev mounted a new version La Fille mal gardée for the Bolshoi Ballet, which was based on the 1903 edition by Gorsky. For this production Messerer and Moiseyev added a new act to the ballet titled The Wedding of Lise and Colas, set to an arrangement of music taken from Glinka's Orpheus.[clarification needed] Messerer and Moiseyev's version remained in the Bolshoi Theatre's repertory for only two years, and was then revived under the title The Rivals in 1935, with the Hertel/Glinka music revised by the conductor Alexander Mosolov. This version was given only eighteen performances and then dropped from the repertory altogether.
The Bolshoi presented yet another revival of La Fille mal gardée in 1937, in a completely new version staged by the choreographer Leonid Lavrovsky. For this production Lavrovsky commissioned the composer Pavel Feldt to create a new score based on the traditional music of Hertel, which included all of the interpolated music the score acquired via Gorsky's revival. After eleven performances Lavrovsky's production was taken out of the Bolshoi Theatre's regular repertory, only to be presented at irregular intervals until the early 1970s. From then on the production was relegated only to occasional performances given by the top graduates of the Bolshoi Ballet Academy.
In 1989 the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet's director Oleg Vinogradov mounted a new version of the ballet for the Kirov Ballet, largely based on the traditional Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky productions from the turn of the 20th century. In spite of being a great success, Vinogradov's production was taken out of the repertory after his departure as director of the Kirov/Mariinsky Ballet in 1995, and to date the company has no production of the full-length work in their repertory.

La fille mal gardée in the West[edit]
Anna Pavlova in ""La Fille mal gardée"", 1912
The first performances of any Russian version of La Fille mal gardée (i.e., derived from Petipa and Ivanov's revivals) in the West were presented by the touring company of the legendary ballerina Anna Pavlova, one of the most celebrated interpreters of the role of Lise, who while touring London in 1912 performed in an abridged version of the ballet.
Bronislava Nijinska staged the first production of La Fille mal gardée in the United States for American Ballet Theatre (then known as the Ballet Theatre) in 1940, a version based on the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky version to the music of Hertel. The original ABT cast included Patricia Bowman as Lisette and Yurek Shabelevsky as Colas.[2] Nijinska's version was revived in 1941 under the title The Wayward Daughter and in 1942 under the title Naughty Lisette. The 1942 production was revised by Dimitri Romanoff in 1949 and was retained in the repertory of the company for many years. Romanoff returned to stage a new version of the ballet for the company in 1972, with Natalia Makarova as Lise. The Romanoff production proved to be a popular piece in the repertory of American Ballet Theatre, who retained the production until 1984. Many famous dancers such as Mikhail Baryshnikov, Gelsey Kirkland, Susan Jaffe, Cynthia Gregory, Fernando Bujones and Marianna Tcherkassky triumphed in the lead roles. Today the company includes Sir Frederick Ashton's version in their active repertory (originally staged for the Royal Ballet in 1960), though the so-called La Fille mal gardée pas de deux derived from the old version is often performed during gala performances.
In 1942 the Ballet Russe de Monte-Carlo presented their first production of La Fille mal gardée, staged by the former ballerina of the Imperial Ballet Alexandra Balachova in a version largely based on Alexander Gorsky's production derived from the Petipa/Ivanov staging of the late 19th century.
Many of the dancers who worked with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo went on to have successful careers as choreographers, teachers and balletmasters abroad, and would use Balachova's version as a basis for many revivals throughout the world. The celebrated ballerina Alicia Alonso danced Balachova's staging of La Fille mal gardée throughout the 1940s and 1950s and she would go on to stage her own version of the work for the Cuban Ballet in 1964. As a result, the majority of ballet companies in the Caribbean and South America regularly perform productions derived from Alonso's staging to the music of Hertel.
In 1985 Claude Bessy staged her version of La Fille mal gardée for the Ballet School of the Paris Opéra, a production inspired by the 1972 version of Dimitri Romanoff for American Ballet Theatre. For this production Bessy used Hertel's 1864 score in an orchestration by the Paris Opéra's conductor Jean-Michel Damase.

Frederick Ashton's Royal Ballet production[edit]

Sarah Lamb (as Lise) and Martin Harvey (as Colas) in the Fanny Elssler pas de deux from Ashton's La Fille mal gardée, London, 2005.
In 1959, the choreographer Frederick Ashton began creating a completely new version of La Fille mal gardée for the Royal Ballet of London. This production premiered on 28 January 1960,[3] with the ballerina Nadia Nerina as Lise, David Blair as Colas, Stanley Holden as the Widow Simone, and Alexander Grant as Alen. Since its inception Ashton's staging has become a celebrated classic of the ballet repertory.
Originally Ashton intended to use the 1864 score of Peter Ludwig Hertel as it had been used for nearly every revival of the ballet since the late 19th century, but after close inspection of this music Ashton decided it would not suit his plans. At the suggestion of the ballet historian and musicologist Ivor Guest, Ashton found the light, simple music of the 1828 score by Ferdinand Hérold, more suitable for his conception.
Ashton then commissioned the Royal Opera House's conductor John Lanchbery to orchestrate and edit Hérold's score, using it as a foundation for an entirely new score, for which Lanchbery composed a few new numbers, incorporating passages of the original pastiche music from the premiere of 1789 into the score, and one number from Hertel's score which was utilised for the famous Clog Dance. Ashton was disappointed that Hérold's score contained no suitable Grand pas; Ivor Guest found a violin reduction of the pas de deux that Fanny Elssler had arranged for her performance in the ballet in 1837, tucked away in an old box of music at the Paris Opéra. This number is now known as The Fanny Elssler pas de deux.
Ashton created what is considered to be among his most masterful choreography for his new version of La Fille mal gardée. He resurrected the Pas de ruban for Lise and Colas, in which the lovers perform a charming pas with intricate tricks using a pink satin ribbon. Ashton took this idea to an entirely new level with the Fanny Elssler pas de deux, devising a spectacular Grand adage for Lise, Colas and eight women with eight ribbons. Ashton also included Petipa's original mimed sequence known as When I'm Married, a passage that was performed by all of the great ballerinas of old when they danced the role of Lise. He was taught this passage by Tamara Karsavina, former Ballerina of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres and the Original Ballet Russe. She had in turn learned it from her teacher Pavel Gerdt, once the Imperial Ballet's leading male dancer who had partnered ballerinas of the late 19th century and early 20th century in the role of Lise.

To inspire Lanchbery to write music for the Clog Dance, Ashton took the composer to a performance of Lancashire clog dancers. This dance is performed in the ballet by Lise's mother, the Widow Simone. Lanchbery decided to use the leitmotiv for the Widow Simone from Hertel's score. Ashton fashioned a humorous number from this music for Simone and four ballerinas, at the beginning of which Lise tempts her mother with a pair of clogs; she puts them on and whirls into one of Ashton's most celebrated numbers, which also features the dancers using the clogs to perform sur la pointe (on their toes).
Ashton's 1960 version of La Fille mal gardée has been staged for many companies throughout the world and has become the more or less ""traditional"" version, replacing the productions derived from the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky versions danced in Russia to the music of Hertel. Among such companies are the Bolshoi Ballet (2002), and American Ballet Theatre (2004). In spite of this, the famous La Fille mal gardée pas de deux, which is taken from the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky versions of the ballet, is still performed with regularity as a gala excerpt, and is often used by various young dancers on the ballet competition circuit.
After Ashton's death, the rights to his staging of La fille mal gardée passed to Alexander Grant, the original performer of the role of Alain. In 2007, the Paris Opéra Ballet invited Grant to supervise a staging of Ashton's version, which premiered at the Palais Garnier on 22 July 2007 with Dorothée Gilbert as Lise, Nicolas Le Riche as Colas, Simon Valastro as Alain, and Stéphane Phavorin as Widow Simone.
As part of a contract between the BBC and the Royal Ballet signed in 1961, La fille mal gardée was one of nine ballets filmed for television, and was broadcast over Christmas 1962 with the original cast.[4] There have been subsequent video recordings issued by the Royal Ballet. In 1962, Lanchbery recorded excerpts of music from his adaptation of Hérold's score, and in 1983 he recorded the complete work, again for Decca Records.

The Ballet du Rhin's revival of the 1789 original[edit]
The performance history of La Fille mal gardée came full circle in 1989, when the Ballet du Rhin of Mulhouse, France presented a revival of Dauberval's original production of 1789. The production was staged by Ivo Cramer, an expert in late 18th century and early 19th century dance theatre, and the Ballet du Rhin's artistic director, Jean Paul Gravier. They painstakingly researched the original production, locating a copy of the original score in Stockholm, which describes the 1789 production, including details of the original mime passages. The original score was restored and orchestrated by the conductor Charles Farncombe. The designer Dominique Delouche created sets and costumes inspired by the designs used in the original. Though Dauberval's original choreography is lost, Cramer crafted dances in the style of the period, with heavy influence from folk dancing, as in the original. Cramer also restored the original scheme for the ballet's finale, in which the dancers, singing along with the music, shout out the refrain Il n'est qu'un pas du mal au bien (""There is Only One Step from Bad to Good""). The production was presented under the original title, Le ballet de la paille (""The Ballet of Straw"").

Characters[edit]

Colas, (Lise's beloved)
Widow Simone, (Lise's mother, traditionally danced by a man)
Alain, (Lise's rich dimwitted suitor)
Thomas, (Alain's father)
Notary
Farm workers, friends of Lise and Colas
Rooster and three hens
Synopsis[edit]
Lise and Colas are in love and want to marry. However, the Widow Simone wants Lise to marry the dimwitted, but extremely rich, Alain, and has arranged (with Alain's father Thomas) for a marriage contract between Lise and Alain. The Widow Simone does her best to keep Lise and Colas apart, but is unsuccessful in her attempts to do so.
At harvest time the Widow Simone and Lise are taken to the field for a picnic lunch by Thomas and Alain. The farm workers join in a ribbon dance around a maypole, and the girls also join in a clog dance with the Widow Simone. There is a thunderstorm and everyone rushes for shelter. Alain is carried away on the wind by his open umbrella.
The Widow Simone and Lise return to their home. The widow wants Lise to sit down at the spinning wheel and spin, but Lise spins while she is up dancing, nearly strangling the widow. After a while, the widow wants Lise to dance, and Lise shows signs of unhappiness, but obliges. The widow takes a tambourine to play in time with Lise's dancing. When the widow is asleep, Lise tries to steal the key from the widow's pocket, to prevent the widow from locking her in, but is unsuccessful. The crops are brought in by the farm workers, and the widow then leaves the house (after locking the door behind her to prevent Lise from leaving the house). Lise thinks about Colas and mimes being the mother of a large number of children. To her embarrassment, Colas suddenly rises from the stacked crops. At the sound of the Widow Simone's returning to the house, Lise and Colas look around desperately for a place where he can hide. Not finding anywhere suitable in the living room, Lise takes Colas to her room, and she returns to the living room just before Widow Simone enters the house. The Widow Simone orders Lise to go to her room and put on her wedding dress for her forthcoming marriage to Alain. The horrified Lise tries to remain where she is, but the Widow Simone pushes Lise into her room and locks the door.
Thomas arrives with his son Alain (who is still clutching his umbrella). They are accompanied by a notary who is to act as witness to the marriage. The farm workers (friends of both Lise and Colas) also arrive. The Widow Simone gives Alain the key to Lise's room. When Alain unlocks the door to Lise's room, Lise appears in her wedding dress, accompanied by Colas. Thomas and Alain take offence, and the enraged Thomas tears up the marriage contract. Thomas, Alain and the notary leave the house in dudgeon. Lise and Colas then beg the Widow Simone to look favourably upon their suit. Love conquers all and the widow relents. Joyfully celebrating the happy outcome for Lise and Colas, everyone leaves, and the house is left quiet and empty, until Alain returns for his umbrella which he had accidentally left behind. So Alain is also happy with the love of his life – his umbrella.

La fille mal gardée (English: The Wayward Daughter, literal translation: ""The Poorly Guarded Girl""), Frederick Ashton's Royal Ballet production, began in 1959 when British choreographer Frederick Ashton created a new version of La fille mal gardée for the Royal Ballet of London. This production premiered on 28 January 1960,[1] with Nadia Nerina as Lise, David Blair as Colas, Stanley Holden as the Widow Simone, and Alexander Grant as Alain. Since its inception Ashton's staging has become a celebrated classic of the ballet repertory.


Background[edit]
Originally Ashton intended to use the 1864 score of Peter Ludwig Hertel, as it had been used for nearly every revival of the ballet since the late 19th century, but after close inspection of this music Ashton decided it would not suit his plans for the revival. At the suggestion of the ballet historian and musicologist Ivor Guest, Ashton studied the 1828 score by Ferdinand Hérold, and found the light, simple music more suitable for his conception.
Ashton then commissioned the Royal Opera House's composer and conductor John Lanchbery to orchestrate and edit Hérold's score. After becoming frustrated with the underdeveloped nature of this music, Ashton and Lanchbery decided that Hérold's music would be better used as a foundation for an entirely new score, for which Lanchbery would compose a few new numbers. They went even further by incorporating passages of the original pastiche music from the premiere of 1789 into the score, as well as one number from Hertel's score which was utilised for the famous Clog Dance.
Ashton was disappointed that Hérold's score contained no suitable Grand pas, and for a while considered using the well-known La Fille mal gardée pas de deux. Ivor Guest found a violin reduction of the pas de deux that Fanny Elssler had arranged for her performance in the ballet in 1837, tucked away in an old box of music at the Paris Opéra. This number is now known as The Fanny Elssler pas de deux.
Ashton created what is considered to be among his most masterful choreography for his new version of La fille mal gardée. He resurrected the Pas de ruban for Lise and Colas, in which the lovers perform a charming pas with intricate tricks using a pink satin ribbon. Ashton took this idea to an entirely new level with the Fanny Elssler pas de deux, devising a spectacular Grand adage for Lise, Colas and eight women with eight ribbons. Ashton also included Petipa's original mimed sequence known as When I'm Married, a passage that was performed by all of the great ballerinas of old when they danced the role of Lise. He was taught this passage by Tamara Karsavina, former Ballerina of the St. Petersburg Imperial Theatres and the Original Ballet Russe. She had in turn learned it from her teacher Pavel Gerdt, once the Imperial Ballet's leading male dancer who partnered all of the great ballerinas of the late 19th century and early 20th century in the role of Lise, including Virginia Zucchi.
Robert Helpmann was originally cast in the role of Widow Simone, spending considerable time in rehearsal before the pressure of film work in the US compelled him to stand down.
To inspire Lanchbery to write music for the Clog Dance, Ashton took the composer to a performance of Lancashire clog dancers. This dance is performed in the ballet by Lise's mother, the Widow Simone. Lanchbery decided to use the leitmotiv for the Widow Simone from Hertel's score, the only music by Hertel that Lanchbery's score contains. Ashton fashioned a humorous number from this music for Simone and four ballerinas, at the beginning of which Lise tempts her mother with a pair of clogs, which she cannot resist. She puts them on and whirls into one of Ashton's most celebrated numbers, which also features the dancers using the clogs to perform sur la pointe (on their toes).
Ashton's 1960 version of La fille mal gardée has been staged for many companies throughout the world and has become the more or less ""traditional"" version, replacing the productions derived from the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky versions danced in Russia to the music of Hertel. Among such companies are the Bolshoi Ballet (2002), and American Ballet Theatre (2004). In spite of this, the famous La Fille mal gardée pas de deux, which is taken from the Petipa/Ivanov/Gorsky versions of the ballet, is still performed with regularity as a gala excerpt, and is often used by various young dancer on the ballet competition circuit.
After Ashton's death, the rights to his staging of La fille mal gardée passed to Alexander Grant, the original performer of the role of Alain. In the 1981 version, the role of Alain was performed by Alexander's brother Garry Grant.
In 2007, the Paris Opéra Ballet invited Alexander Grant to supervise a staging of Ashton's version, which premiered at the Palais Garnier on 22 July 2007 with Dorothée Gilbert as Lise, Nicolas Le Riche as Colas, Simon Valastro as Alain, Stéphane Phavorin as the Widow Simone and Gil Isoart as the Piper.
As part of a contract between the BBC and the Royal Ballet signed in 1961, La fille mal gardée was one of nine ballets filmed for television, and was broadcast over Christmas 1962 with the original cast.[2]
In 1984, Ashton's production was filmed at Covent Garden, with Lesley Collier as Lise, and Michael Coleman as Colas. A later recording, featuring Marianela Núñez and Carlos Acosta, was made in 2005. Both recordings are available on DVD.

Synopsis[edit]
Lise and Colas are in love and want to marry. However, the Widow Simone wants Lise to marry the dimwitted, but extremely rich, Alain, and has arranged (with Alain's father Thomas) for a marriage contract between Lise and Alain. The Widow Simone does her best to keep Lise and Colas apart, but is unsuccessful in her attempts to do so.
At harvest time the Widow Simone and Lise are taken to the field for a picnic lunch by Thomas and Alain. The farm workers join in a ribbon dance around a maypole, and the girls also join in a clog dance with the Widow Simone. There is a thunderstorm and everyone rushes for shelter. Alain is carried away on the wind by his open umbrella.
The Widow Simone and Lise return to their home. The widow wants Lise to sit down at the spinning wheel and spin, but Lise spins while she is up dancing, nearly strangling the widow. After a while, the widow wants Lise to dance, and Lise shows signs of unhappiness, but obliges. The widow takes a tambourine to play in time with Lise's dancing. When the widow is asleep, Lise tries to steal the key from the widow's pocket, to prevent the widow from locking her in, but is unsuccessful. The crops are brought in by the farm workers, and the widow then leaves the house (after locking the door behind her to prevent Lise from leaving the house). Lise thinks about Colas and mimes being the mother of a large number of children. To her embarrassment, Colas suddenly rises from the stacked crops. At the sound of the Widow Simone's returning to the house, Lise and Colas look around desperately for a place where he can hide. Not finding anywhere suitable in the living room, Lise takes Colas to her room, and she returns to the living room just before Widow Simone enters the house. The Widow Simone orders Lise to go to her room and put on her wedding dress for her forthcoming marriage to Alain. The horrified Lise tries to remain where she is, but the Widow Simone pushes Lise into her room and locks the door.
Thomas arrives with his son Alain (who is still clutching his umbrella). They are accompanied by a notary who is to act as witness to the marriage. The farm workers (friends of both Lise and Colas) also arrive. The Widow Simone gives Alain the key to Lise's room. When Alain unlocks the door to Lise's room, Lise appears in her wedding dress, accompanied by Colas. Thomas and Alain take offence, and the enraged Thomas tears up the marriage contract. Thomas, Alain and the notary leave the house in dudgeon. Lise and Colas then beg the Widow Simone to look favourably upon their suit. Love conquers all and the widow relents. Joyfully celebrating the happy outcome for Lise and Colas, everyone leaves, and the house is left quiet and empty, until Alain returns for his umbrella which he had accidentally left behind. So Alain is also happy with the love of his life – his umbrella.

Five Movements, Three Repeats is a dance choreographed by Christopher Wheeldon. It is set to music by Max Richter, including his mashup of ""This Bitter Earth"", written by  Clyde Otis and sung by Dinah Washington. It premiered at the Vail International Dance Festival in Gerald R. Ford Amphitheater, Vail, Colorado,[1] performed by Fang-Yi Sheu, Wendy Whelan, Tyler Angle and Craig Hall. The ""This Bitter Earth"" pas de deux is often performed separately from the rest of the piece. 


Production[edit]
Five Movements, Three Repeats was created for the Vail International Dance Festival, and premiered there in August 2012, after an incomplete version with the same cast was danced there the previous year. The original cast includes Fang-Yi Sheu, a Taiwanese modern dancer and former Martha Graham Dance Company principal dancer, and three dancers from New York City Ballet: principal dancers Wendy Whelan, Tyler Angle, and soloist Craig Hall.[1]
The title is a reference to the use of five songs by Max Richter, and a section with all four dancers in their ""separate zones"" is repeated three times, including once ""spatially reversed"". A pas de deux originated by Whelan and Angle is set to a mashup of ""This Bitter Earth"", written by Clyde Otis and sung by Dinah Washington, and Richter's ""On the Nature of Daylight"", first used in the film Shutter Island. Sheu danced barefoot and Whelan was in pointe shoes.[2][3]

Revivals[edit]
External videos Christopher Wheeldon's ""This Bitter Earth"", YouTube video New York City Ballet Presents Christopher Wheeldon's This Bitter Earth, YouTube video
In September 2012, the ""This Bitter Earth"" pas de deux was added to New York City Ballet's repertory. The company first performed it at their fall gala, with Whelan and Angle reprising their respective roles, wearing costumes from the fashion house Valentino. The company had since revived it with other casts, donning Reid Bartelme's costumes instead.[3][4][5]
Also in September 2012, the original cast performed Five Movements, Three Repeats for the Fall for Dance Festival at the New York City Center.[2] Sheu later performed the piece with former Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater dancer Clifton Brown, and San Francisco Ballet principal dancers Yuan Yuan Tan and Damian Smith.[6] In 2016, Vail International Dance Festival revived the ""This Bitter Earth"" pas de deux, danced by Isabella Boylston and Calvin Royal III, both from the American Ballet Theatre, accompanied by live vocals from Kate Davis.[7][8]

Videography[edit]
In 2020, New York City Ballet made a one-shot film with an excerpt of the ""This Bitter Earth"" pas de deux, danced by Sara Mearns and Adrian Danchig-Waring. Whelan, who became the associate artistic director of the company, was present on set. The short film was originally made to promote the spring season, which was cancelled before the film was released due to the coronavirus pandemic.[9]
Due to the pandemic, the Vail International Dance Festival in 2020 used a digital format, and a video of the 2016 performance of the ""This Bitter Earth"" pas de deux with Boylston and Royal was streamed on its opening night.[10]

Franca Florio, regina di PalermoPortrait of Donna Franca by Giovanni Boldini.ChoreographerLuciano CannitoMusicLorenzo FerreroPremiere22 November 2007Teatro Massimo, PalermoSettingSicilyTypeNarrative ballet
Franca Florio, regina di Palermo is a full-length narrative ballet in two acts, with music by Lorenzo Ferrero and scenario, choreography and staging by Luciano Cannito. A commission by the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, the work premiered there on 22 November 2007 with Carla Fracci in the title role, and was restaged in June 2010.
Set in Sicily, the story is based on the life of Franca Jacona Notarbartolo di San Giuliano (1873-1950), a famous Sicilian aristocrat whose beauty inspired many artists, musicians, and poets during the Belle Époque, who retraces the highlights of her life from her retreat on the island of Favignana. Her past is explored chronologically, by means of extensive flashbacks of events. The Florio's story, replete with worldly success but also with tragic events, is in part the metaphor of the failure of the industrial development in Sicily at the beginning of the twentieth century.[1]


Roles[edit]
The ballet employs a large corps de ballet and the lead, solo and minor roles are numerous.
The Florio family:

Synopsis


Act 1


1

On the sea shore at Favignana a lonely old woman gives herself up to memories.


2

In her parents' house in Palermo young Franca is preparing to take a walk in the town, accompanied by her two inseparable cousins.


3

Assisted by his staff, Ignazio works diligently in his office until he decides to have a short break.


4

Franca strolls along the Marina di Palermo, admired by everybody. She is passed by Ignazio, who is in the company of his friend, Vera Arrivabene.


5

Ignazio and Franca's glances crisscross; his wish to make her acquaintance brings deep embarrassment to Vera.


6

Ignazio kisses Franca's hand and between the two of them there is love at first sight. Vera, left aside, is offended and embittered.


7

It seems that the world stops around them, but the arrival of her parents compels them to separate.


8

At Favignana, Franca rereads an old letter from Ignazio and is deeply moved.


9

Ignazio is neglecting his work and continuously sends notes to Franca. Her family is not enthusiastic about their daughter's relationship with a bourgeois, despite his great wealth.


10

Franca and Ignazio get married in Livorno and return to Palermo after the ceremony.


11

A grand wedding reception takes place there. The gathering is disrupted by Vera, who provokes a confrontation with Franca.


12

The guests leave. A long pas de deux precedes the wedding night.


Act 2


1

At Favignana, Franca lives with her memories, supported by the affection of the local fishermen.


2

Several years later, Franca and Ignazio become the leading lights of the high society and are still happily united. Together they go to the launch of the Aegusa, a luxury yacht which he gives her as a present.


3

During this event their little daughter faints and is taken home immediately. Her health deteriorates and the mother remains close to the child's bed until her death.


4

Preparations are made for the arrival of the Kaiser.


5

Wilhelm II and empress consort Augusta Victoria arrive with their retinue. Palermo celebrates together with the Florios.


6

They are also visited by the English royal family and other notables.


7

Various Russian princes arrive at Palermo, to vacation with the Florios.


8

A change comes about between the spouses after the tragic deaths of Giovanna and little Ignazio, nicknamed Baby Boy. Franca withdraws to her rooms and Ignazio, upset by his wife's spurning, succumbs to Vera's temptation.


9

Franca and Ignazio attend the inauguration of the Teatro Massimo. Backstage, he flirts with a ballerina while she elegantly pretends not to take notice.


10

The painter Boldini portraits Franca in increasingly risqué poses. Ignazio catches them and destroys the painting. Soon after, repenting, he presents her with a splendid pearl necklace and orders a new portrait from the painter.


11

Even though Ignazio's passion has vanished, Franca is expecting a baby again; she still loves him and would very much like to give him the male heir he longs for.


12

At Favignana, Franca relives the most dramatic events from her past.


13

In the Sanremo Casino Ignazio sits with Vera and flirts with other women under the gaze of Franca, who is sitting alone at another table. He gambles all his money away. Times have changed and the two leave separately.


14

The sun is setting down in Favignana. Franca, frail and lonely, lives on an island in the middle of a sea of memories. As a relic of her better days, Boldini's 1924 portrait slowly descends from above onto the stage.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


1930 ballet by Dmitri Shostakovich

The Golden Age or The Age of Gold (Russian: Золотой век, Zolotoi vek), Op. 22, is a ballet in three acts and six scenes by Dmitri Shostakovich to a libretto by Alexander Ivanovsky. Choreographed by Vasili Vainonen (first act),[1] Leonid Jacobson (second act),[2] and V. Chesnakov (third act), it premiered on 26 October 1930 at the Kirov Theatre.[3]
The work was performed eighteen times[4] and was initially censored due to its inclusion of modern European dance styles.[5]


Plot summary[edit]
The ballet is a satirical take on the political and cultural change in 1920s Europe. It follows a Soviet football (soccer) team in a Western city where they come into contact with many politically incorrect antagonistic characters such as the Diva, the Fascist, the Agent Provocateur, the Negro and others. The team falls victim to match rigging, police harassment, and unjust imprisonment by the evil bourgeoisie. The team is freed from jail when the local workers overthrow their capitalist overlords. The ballet ends with a dance of solidarity between the workers and the football team.
Shostakovich himself was a very keen football follower, and is said to have coined the expression ""Football is the ballet of the masses"".

Suite[edit]
Shostakovich extracted a suite from the ballet, Op. 22a, in four movements:

Introduction (Allegro non troppo)
Adagio
Polka (Allegretto)
Danse
The Polka was reused as the second of his Two Pieces for String Quartet in 1931. He also arranged the Polka for solo piano (Op. 22b) and piano four hands (Op. 22c), in 1935 and 1962 respectively.

Revivals[edit]
In 1982, Yury Grigorovich and Isaak Glikman revived the ballet with a new libretto. Grigorovich also chose to integrate other works of Shostakovich into the score.[7]
In 1983, he created The Golden Age for Irek Mukhamedov, who defined the role of Boris, the young workers' leader, for successive generations of Bolshoi dancers. They moved the action to the USSR in the 1920s to a restaurant called ""The Golden Age"". Conflict unfolded between the Soviet Komsomol and the gang. The premiere took place on 4 November 1982 in Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre.
In 2006, the playwright Konstantin Uchitel wrote a new libretto for the same music. The action was set in present day. Old man and old woman meet and remember their youth. The premiere took place on 28 June 2006 at the Mariinsky Theatre.

Ballet premiered in 1974


L'histoire de ManonChoreographerSir Kenneth MacMillanMusicJules Massenet, original orchestration by Leighton Lucas – New orchestration in 2011 by Martin YatesPremiere1974Royal Opera House, LondonOriginal ballet companyRoyal BalletGenreClassical ballet
L'histoire de Manon, generally referred to as Manon, is a ballet choreographed by Kenneth MacMillan to music by Jules Massenet and based on the 1731 novel Manon Lescaut by Abbé Prévost. The ballet was first performed by The Royal Ballet in London in 1974 with Antoinette Sibley and Anthony Dowell in the leading roles. It continues to be performed and recognised internationally.


Background[edit]
Kenneth MacMillan had been thinking about choreographing a ballet about the story of Manon Lescaut for some time. Three years into his artistic directorship of The Royal Ballet, he wanted to create a large-scale operatic ballet that would provide exciting roles both for the company's principal dancers and the corps de ballet.[1]
On the last night of the company's summer season in 1973, MacMillan left a copy of Prévost's novel in Antoinette Sibley's dressing room, with a note informing her that it would ""come in handy for March 7, '74"". As the copy of Manon Lescaut was in a double volume with the novella Carmen by Prosper Mérimée, Sibley asked Anthony Dowell to find out which story was to be turned into a ballet, while she performed onstage in The Sleeping Beauty.[2]
MacMillan began choreographing Manon during the 1973–74 season. He left the title character open to differing dancer interpretations, but was himself sympathetic to her poverty, believing that it was her desire to escape this that underpinned her decisions.[1]
MacMillan used the designs of Nicholas Georgiadis, which reflected the ""precarious division between opulence and degradation"" with ""the stench of poverty ever-present"".[3] The ballet's narrative structure is based on that of MacMillan's earlier Romeo and Juliet, with hero and heroine meeting each other as young innocents and their love being revealed through a series of pas de deux.[4]
Critical responses to the opening night performance were mixed. The Guardian newspaper stated, ""Basically, Manon is a slut and Des Grieux is a fool and they move in the most unsavoury company"", while the Morning Star described the ballet as ""an appalling waste of the lovely Antoinette Sibley, who is reduced to a nasty little diamond digger"". The opening night audience gave the ballet a standing ovation.[5]

Synopsis[edit]
Act I – Paris
Scene 1 – The courtyard of an inn near Paris
The courtyard at the inn is frequented by actresses, gentlemen and the demimonde from Paris. Among them are des Grieux, a young student, the wealthy Monsieur GM, and Lescaut, who is there to meet his sister Manon on her way to enter a convent. A coach arrives bringing Manon and an old gentleman who has been very much attracted to her. Lescaut notices this and takes the gentleman into the inn to come to an arrangement with him over Manon. Manon remains outside and meets des Grieux. They fall in love and decide to escape to Paris with the help of the money that she has stolen from the old gentleman. Lescaut and the old gentleman come out of the inn, having made a bargain, and to their dismay see that Manon has disappeared. Monsieur GM tells Lescaut that he too is interested in Manon and because of this wealth Lescaut promises to find Manon and persuade her to accept GM.
Scene 2 – Des Grieux's lodgings in Paris
Des Grieux is writing a letter to his father but Manon interrupts by declaring her love for him. Des Grieux goes to post the letter and in his absence Lescaut arrives with Monsieur GM. Manon yields to GM's advances and when des Grieux returns, Lescaut persuades him that there will be great wealth for all of them if he, des Grieux, will sanction the liaison between Manon and GM.
Act II
Scene 1 – A party at the hotel particulier of Madame
Manon arrives at the party given by Monsieur GM and is clearly torn between the wealth of her companion and her love for des Grieux, who is also there with Lescaut. Des Grieux tries to persuade Manon to leave with him but she tells him that the time is not right and only will be when he takes more of Monsieur GM's money at cards. Des Grieux is caught cheating and he and Manon rush away.
Scene 2 – Des Grieux's lodgings
Manon and des Grieux once again declare their love for one another but Monsieur GM arrives with the police and Manon is arrested as a prostitute. In the ensuing struggle Lescaut is killed.
Act III – New Orleans
Scene 1 – The port
The gaoler of the penal colony awaits the arrival of the convicts from France. Manon has been deported to America as a prostitute and des Grieux has followed her there by pretending to be her husband. The gaoler now turns his interest towards Manon.
Scene 2 – The gaoler's room
The gaoler has arrested Manon but offers her rewards in the hope that she will desert des Grieux and live with him. Des Grieux, however, breaks in and kills the gaoler.
Scene 3 – The swamp
Manon and des Grieux have escaped into the swamp of Louisiana. All her former ambitions of wealth and splendour have been renounced for her love for des Grieux. While eluding their pursuers, Manon collapses and dies in his arms.

Music in L'histoire de Manon[edit]
MacMillan chose not to use music from Massenet's opera Manon, instead selecting other well-known pieces by the same composer such as Elegie and Méditation. The music, originally arranged and partially orchestrated by the British composer Leighton Lucas and re-orchestrated by the conductor Martin Yates in 2011, draws on thirteen operas and two oratorios as well as Massenet's orchestral suites, various mélodies and piano works.

2018 ballet by Justin Peck and M83

Hurry Up, We're Dreaming is a ballet choreographed by Justin Peck to music from French electronic music band M83's album of the same name, which was written by Anthony Gonzalez, Yann Gonzalez, Brad Laner and Justin Meldal-Johnsen. The ballet was commissioned for the San Francisco Ballet's Unbound Festival and premiered on April 20, 2018, at the War Memorial Opera House.[1]


Production[edit]
Background[edit]
Justin Peck's Hurry Up, We're Dreaming was commissioned for San Francisco Ballet's Unbound Festival in 2018, in which 12 one-act ballets were created.[2] When the ballet premiered, he was a New York City Ballet soloist, resident choreographer and interim leader, though he had previously made In the Countenance of Kings for the San Francisco Ballet, stated the troupe is his ""favorite company to work with"" outside of his home company.[3]

Music[edit]
The ballet is set to French electronic music band M83's album Hurry Up, We're Dreaming, including the song ""Wait.""[4] The music featured in the ballet was written by Anthony Gonzalez, Yann Gonzalez, Brad Laner and Justin Meldal-Johnsen.[5] The album is about people dreaming at different stages of life.[3] Peck listened to the album during his last time working with the San Francisco Ballet, and commented, ""I chose this music because of my experience with it and how it inspired me in relation to these dancers in this company.""[3]

Choreography[edit]
As with other ballets at the Unbound Festival, Hurry Up, We're Dreaming was made over the course of three weeks in late 2017, and the creative teams returned three weeks before opening night.[2]
The choreography of Hurry Up made references to the music's theme of people dreaming at different stages of life, as children, teenagers and adults.[3] The ballet is performed by fourteen dancers,[3] including three duets originated by Dores André, Wei Wang, Sarah Van Patten, Luke Ingham, Gabriela Gonzalez and Ulrik Birkkjaer.[n 1][4] Peck said he ""had some in mind from the beginning,"" like Birkkjaer, who had toured in New York with the Royal Danish Ballet, and Gonzalez, who Peck met at the Miami City Ballet School.[3]
Hurry Up is danced in sneakers.[4] San Francisco Ballet artistic director Helgi Tomasson commented that the choreography of Hurry Up is ""largely classical but the sneakers bring an entirely different look to them."" He pointed out that choreographer Jerome Robbins had used sneakers in ballets decades ago but he was ""very different"" and Peck ""has his feet firmly in today’s culture.""[7]

Costumes[edit]
The costumes are designed by Reid Bartelme and Harriet Jung, and are streetwear made of metallic fabrics.[5][8]

Critical reception[edit]
The ballet received positive reviews. On the premiere, Allan Ulrich of the San Francisco Chronicle called the ballet ""a cleverly and congenially constructed romp that evokes a summer of love"" but noted the duets ""miss a distinctive tone.""[1] The New York Times's Alastair Macaulay called it ""the most valuable creation of Unbound so far"" but nevertheless noted the ballet is ""imperfect.""[5] When summarizing the entire festival, Macaulay listed Hurry Up as one of two pieces at the festival he was ""eager to revisit.""[9] On the company's tour appearance in London in 2019, Lyndsey Winship from The Guardian wrote that Hurry Up ""is very balletic, but feels fresh, with a youthful authenticity.""[10]
Peck was nominated for the Prix Benois de la Danse for Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.[11] The New York Times included the ballet its ""Best Dance of 2018"" list.[12]

Notes[edit]


^ According to the program note, the role of Dores André's partner was created on Joseph Walsh, and according to Bachtrack, he was injured the 2018 season season. He had since performed the ballet.[6]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Erik Satie in 1898
Jack in the Box (sometimes seen as Jack-in-the-Box) is a work written by Erik Satie in 1899 for a pantomime-ballet (Satie called it a ""clownerie"", and also a ""suite anglaise"")[1] to a scenario by the illustrator Jules Depaquit. Satie gave it an English title because English phrases were considered fashionable in Parisian society at the time.[2]
Satie's intention was to score it also for orchestra. However, after he wrote the piano score, he lost it some time after 1905.[1] Satie believed it had gone missing on a bus and that it would never be found, but after his death it was found in his squalid apartment in Arcueil (some sources say it was hidden inside a notebook lodged down the back of his decrepit piano),[2][3] along with the lost score for his marionette opera Geneviève de Brabant.[1] Depaquit's scenario has not survived.[2]

The ""House of 4 Chimneys"" in Arcueil, where Satie lived from 1898 until his death. Jack in the Box was the first notable work he composed there.
Sergei Diaghilev had approached Satie for ballet music in 1922 and again in 1924, but nothing was forthcoming either time. Satie died in July 1925, and in June 1926, to commemorate the 60th anniversary of his birth, Jack in the Box was produced by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, with choreography by George Balanchine, settings by André Derain, and the music orchestrated by Satie's friend Darius Milhaud.[3][4]  The ballet received mainly negative comments: French critics called it ""banal"", while English critics decried it as ""pert but hollow.""[1]
It was also published as a short suite for solo piano in the form in which Satie left it.  The piano and orchestral versions have both received numerous recordings.
The work has three short movements, lasting less than seven minutes.

Prélude: Assez vifEntr'acte: VifFinal: Modéré
All the movements are in C major,[1] and all undergo many meter changes between 24 and 34, the changes often lasting for only a single measure at a time. The music is said to exhibit a bouncy humour and an appealing naivete.[3]  It has perky, jaunty rhythms and blurred harmonies.[2]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

(Redirected from Jardin aux Lilas)
Portrait of Hugh Laing in the 1940 American premiere of Jardin aux lilas
Jardin aux lilas (Lilac Garden) is a ballet in one act choreographed by Antony Tudor to a composition by Ernest Chausson entitled Poème, Op. 25. With scenery and costumes designed by Hugo Stevenson, it was first presented by Ballet Rambert at the Mercury Theatre, London, on 26 January 1936. It is considered to be the first of the genre of psychological ballets.[1]


History[edit]
The inspiration for Chausson's Poème came from a novella by the Russian writer Ivan Turgenev, known to him in French as Le Chant de l'amour triomphant and in English as The Song of Triumphant Love, which concerns a set of intertwined relationships. Tudor tried setting his ballet to other compositions before realizing that Poème was a perfect fit for the situation he wished to portray.[2] His ballet about unrequited love is as much about the necessity of people of the British upper classes to suppress their emotions and yield to the constraints of social convention. As a psychological study, it is a mirror of the interior monologue of its heroine, Caroline.[3]
Jardin aux lilas is an early example of Tudor's mastery of conveying profound psychological meaning and nuance through ballet vocabulary. Among his earlier works, it is also one of his most beloved. Mounted by numerous companies around the world, including American Ballet Theatre and the Paris Opera Ballet, it continues to be performed today.

Synopsis[edit]
The ballet is set at an evening garden party during the Edwardian era (1901–1910) in England. A young woman, Caroline, who is engaged to marry a man she does not love, has come to say goodbye to her friends and, particularly, Her Lover. She steals brief moments with him during the gathering, while The Man She Must Marry himself privately encounters An Episode in His Past, also present at the party. Attempts at intimacy are constantly interrupted by other guests. Caroline ultimately bids Her Lover a halted farewell as The Man She Must Marry takes her on his arm and leads her away in their betrothal of convenience. Her Lover, having secretly given Caroline a gift of lilacs at the last possible moment, is left alone as the curtain closes.[4]

Original cast[edit]
Jardin aux lilas is ideally suited to performance in a small theater, where the audience has a clear view of the subtle, emotionally wrought exchanges among the four principal characters. The original cast included Maude Lloyd as Caroline, Hugh Laing as Her Lover, Tudor himself as The Man She Must Marry, and Peggy van Praagh as An Episode in His Past. In January 1940, the American premiere was given by Ballet Theatre during its inaugural season in New York, with Tudor and Laing in their original roles, Viola Essen as Caroline, and Karen Conrad as An Episode in His Past.[5]

Legacy[edit]
Two versions of this dance were documented in Labanotation by the Dance Notation Bureau.  The first was notated in 1967.[6]  The second was notated in 1981.[7]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Le jeune homme et la mortChoreographerRoland PetitLibrettoJean CocteauPremiere25 June 1946Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, ParisOriginal ballet companyBallets des Champs-ÉlyséesDesignGeorges Wakhévitch
Le Jeune Homme et la Mort is a ballet by Roland Petit, choreographed in 1946 to Bach's Passacaglia and Fugue in C Minor, BWV 582, with a one-act libretto by Jean Cocteau. It tells the story of a young man driven to suicide by his faithless lover. Sets were by Georges Wakhévitch and costumes variously reported as being by Karinska or Cocteau. Petit is purported[according to whom?] to have created Le Jeune Homme et la Mort for his wife-to-be Zizi Jeanmaire, but it was danced by Jean Babilée and Nathalie Philippart at its 25 June 1946 premiere at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées with costumes by Tom Keogh.[1]
In 1951, Petit staged the ballet at American Ballet Theatre. In 1966, he filmed the ballet in France with Rudolf Nureyev and Zizi Jeanmaire.[2]
Le Jeune Homme et la Mort was revived by Mikhail Baryshnikov at the American Ballet Theatre in 1975 and in the 1985 movie White Nights, in arrangements by Petit for Baryshnikov. It has been in the repertoire of the Paris Opera Ballet since 1990 and was danced at its premiere there by Kader Belarbi. It has also been danced by the Ballet National de Marseilles (1984), the Berlin Opera Ballet (1985), the Boston Ballet (1998), the Bolshoi Ballet (2009),[3] the Mariinsky Ballet (late 1990s, revival 2012)[4] and the English National Ballet (2018).

Job: A Masque for Dancing is a one-act ballet produced in 1931. The scenario is by Geoffrey Keynes, the choreography by Ninette de Valois, and the music by Ralph Vaughan Williams. The ballet is based on the Book of Job from the Hebrew Bible and was inspired by the illustrated edition by William Blake. The music was first given in concert in 1930 and the ballet had its stage premiere on 5 July 1931. It was the first ballet to be produced by an entirely British creative team. It was taken into the repertoire of the Vic-Wells Ballet and its successors, and has been intermittently revived.


Background[edit]
In 1927, the centenary of the death of William Blake, Geoffrey Keynes, a leading Blake scholar and also a dance enthusiast, wrote the scenario for ""a ballet of a kind which would be new to the English stage"",[1] based on Blake's illustrations for the Book of Job, published in 1826.[2] Helped by his wife’s sister, the designer Gwen Raverat, Keynes selected eight of Blake's 21 illustrations as suitable for stage adaptation. They then approached Raverat’s cousin Ralph Vaughan Williams to write the music. He agreed, and was so enthusiastic about the idea that he pressed ahead with composition before Keynes and Raverat completed their work.[3]
Meanwhile, Keynes offered the scenario to the impresario Sergei Diaghilev of the Ballets Russes, who turned it down as ""too English and too old-fashioned"".[3] Vaughan Williams was not displeased by this. He had a low opinion of classical ballet, detested dance en pointe, and regarded Diaghilev's troupe as ""decadent and frivolous"".[3] He felt they would have made ""an unholy mess"" of the piece.[3] He so disliked ballet that he insisted that the work should be labelled ""a masque for dancing"", although the critic Frank Howes, who admired the composer greatly, pointed out that the essence of a masque is that it is a combination of all the arts of the theatre, and ""without songs and dialogues a masque is not a masque but a pantomime"".[4]
After Diaghilev's rejection of the piece, the Keynes brothers – Geoffrey and Maynard – together with the composer Thomas Dunhill agreed to fund a staging of the work by the recently formed Camargo Society.[5] The orchestral score was by this time complete, and was premiered by the Queen's Hall Orchestra conducted by the composer at the Norwich Festival on 23 October 1930.[6] Vaughan Williams had written for a large orchestra, too big for a West End theatre pit, and Constant Lambert undertook a reduction of the score for smaller forces.[6] Ninette de Valois was engaged as choreographer. She and her employer, Lilian Baylis of the Old Vic, had seen and approved the Raverat designs.[5] Job was the first ballet to be produced by an entirely British creative team.[7]

Premiere[edit]
On Sunday 5 July 1931 the ballet was performed at the Cambridge Theatre, London, conducted by Lambert. The cast comprised:

The production was repeated the next day and again on 24 July at Oxford as part of the ninth festival of the International Society for Contemporary Music. It was well received. The critic A. K. Holland, reporting ""a tumultuous reception"", called the work ""a triumph for Vaughan Williams ... the most important recent contribution to English ballet"".[8] Another reviewer wrote:

""If the Camargo Society had nothing more to its credit than this ... it would have thoroughly justified its existence and, judging from the enthusiasm of the audience at the Cambridge Theatre, satisfied its subscribers ... had it been one of Diaghilev's productions when his Russian company was at its prime, it would have been hailed as one of his most outstanding achievements.[9]
According to The Times, ""here was that rare thing, a completely satisfying synthesis of the arts"".[10]

Music[edit]
The full orchestral version is scored for three flutes (third doubling on piccolo and alto flute), two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets (in B♭), alto saxophone, bass clarinet (doubling on third clarinet in B♭), two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns (in F), three trumpets (in B♭), three trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, side drum, cymbals, bass drum, xylophone, glockenspiel, tam tam, organ, two harps, and strings.[6]
Lambert's instrumentation for theatre orchestra comprises: 2 flutes (second doubling piccolo), 1 oboe, 2 clarinets, E♭ saxophone (played by second clarinet), 2 horns, 2 trumpets, 1 trombone, timpani, percussion (3 players: cymbals, bass drum, xylophone, glockenspiel, tam-tam), 1 harp, strings.[6]
Vaughan Williams dedicated the score to the conductor Adrian Boult in 1934, after learning that at Boult's instigation the Bach Choir had raised funds towards the engraving of the full orchestra score of Job.[11] Boult made four commercial recordings of the work – with the BBC Symphony Orchestra (issued 1946), the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1954 and 1966), and the London Symphony Orchestra (1971).[12]

Performance history[edit]
The ballet was given on 22 September 1931 at the Old Vic. An adapted version was performed in New York at the Lewisohn Stadium in 1931, staged by Ted Shawn, who danced the role of Satan.[13] The Camargo Society revived the original ballet in mid-1932 and took it to Copenhagen in September of that year. From 1932 onwards it remained in the Vic-Wells (later Sadler's Wells) Ballet repertoire and was first presented on the large stage of the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in May 1948.[14] Boult conducted, and the full orchestral score, rather than Lambert's reduction, was played.[15] Raverat's original sets were considered unsuitable for the large Covent Garden stage, and new designs were commissioned from John Piper. Robert Helpmann played Satan and the cast included Donald Britton, John Cranko, Leslie Edwards, Julia Farron, John Field, Alexander Grant, Rowena Jackson, Gillian Lynne, Nadia Nerina and Michael Somes. The production was seen at intervals throughout the 1950s,[16] and staged by the Birmingham Royal Ballet in the 1990s,[17] including a performance in Coventry Cathedral in 1993.[18]

Sections[edit]
The ballet comprises nine scenes, loosely based upon the sequence of Blake's illustrations and each including in the synopsis a quotation from the Bible. Vaughan Williams headed his score with 18 section headings.

(Redirected from Leda, the Swiss Milkmaid)

Lydia, the Swiss Milkmaid (a.k.a. Lydia, ou la Laitière Suisse, or as Natalie, oder Das schweizer Milchmädche) is a Demi-Caractère ballet in 2 acts, with choreography by Filippo Taglioni and music by Adalbert Gyrowetz.[1]
First presented as Das schweizer Milchmädche at the Theater am Kärntnertor, Vienna, Austrian Empire on Monday, October 8, 1821.[2]

Revivals[edit]
Revival by Filippo Taglioni for the Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique under the title Nathalie, ou la Laitière suisse, with Michele Carafa revising Gyrowetz's score. First presented in Paris, France, on November 7, 1832. Principal dancers: Marie Taglioni.
Revival by Jules Perrot, Marius Petipa and Jean Petipa in 2 acts-2 scenes for the Imperial Ballet under the title Lydia, ou la Laitière Suisse with Cesare Pugni revising Carafa's 1832 version of Gyrowetz's score. First presented at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia on December 20 [O.S. December 8] 1849. Principal Dancers: Fanny Elssler
Notes[edit]
The Balletmaster Antoine Titus created a ballet with the same title for the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin, in Paris in 1823. In 1832 Titus restaged his 1823 production of for the Court Opera Ballet in Berlin, Prussia with Fanny Elssler in the lead role, and in 1833 staged the work for the Imperial Ballet in St. Petersburg where it was not well received.
Marius Petipa claimed sole authorship of the 1849 revival in St. Petersburg in his memoirs, in which he refers to the work as ""a new ballet of my own."". This was disputed throughout the 19th century—a published review by A. Wolf of the Imperial Ballet's 1849–1850 season credits the work as ""Jules Perrot's new production"", while in the ballet historian Alexander Pleshcheyev's study of the ballet of Tsarist St. Petersburg, titled Our Ballet, the work is attributed to Petipa's father Jean Petipa, with only Perrot having contributed one of the ballet's dances. In the biography Jules Perrot: Master of the Romantic Ballet by the ballet historian Ivor Guest, the ballet's choreography is credited to Jean Petipa, except for the Scène dansante and a Pas de trois which are credited to Perrot.

Les mariés de la tour EiffelChoreographerJean BörlinMusicLes SixLibrettoJean CocteauPremiere18 June 1921 (1921-06-18)Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, ParisOriginal ballet companyBallets suédois
Les mariés de la tour Eiffel (The Wedding Party on the Eiffel Tower) is a ballet to a libretto by Jean Cocteau, choreography by Jean Börlin, set by Irène Lagut [fr], costumes by Jean Hugo, and music by five members of Les Six: Georges Auric, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc and Germaine Tailleferre.  The score calls for two narrators. The ballet was first performed in Paris in 1921.


Background[edit]
The ballet had its genesis in a commission to Jean Cocteau and Georges Auric, from Rolf de Maré of the Ballets suédois.  Cocteau's original title for his scenario was The Wedding Party Massacre.[1] It has been suggested that Raymond Radiguet, the young writer close to Cocteau at the time, made some contribution to the libretto.[2]
Running short of time, Auric asked his fellow members of Les Six to also contribute music, and all of them did except Louis Durey, who pleaded illness.[1]
It was staged by the Ballets suédois at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris on 18 June 1921, the principal dancers being C. Ari, J. Figoni, and K. Vahlander.  The orchestra was conducted by Désiré-Émile Inghelbrecht.[3]  The narrators were Jean Cocteau and Pierre Bertin.[3]
It had a brief moment of fame and even scandal, but then fell into oblivion, although it was given in New York City in 1923. A new production opened there in 1988.[2]

Story[edit]
The story of the ballet is somewhat nonsensical: 

The new couple have a wedding breakfast on Bastille Day (July 14) at a table on one of the platforms of the famous tower. A guest makes a pompous speech. When a humpbacked photographer bids everyone to ""watch the birdie,"" it appears that a telegraph office suddenly springs into existence on the platform. A lion comes in and eats one of the guests for breakfast and a strange figure called ""a child of the future"" appears and kills everybody.  Nevertheless, the ballet concludes with the end of the wedding.[4]
When asked what the ballet was about, Cocteau replied: ""Sunday vacuity; human beastliness, ready-made expressions, disassociation of ideas from flesh and bone, ferocity of childhood, the miraculous poetry of everyday life.""[5]
On 29 July 1923, in a letter, Francis Poulenc described the work as ""toujours de la merde ... hormis l'Ouverture d'Auric"" (""yet more shit ... apart from Auric's Overture"").[6]

The ballet[edit]
The sections of the ballet are: 

Overture (14 July) - Georges Auric
Marche nuptiale - Darius Milhaud
Discours du General (Polka) – Francis Poulenc
La Baigneuse de Trouville – Poulenc
La Fugue du Massacre – Milhaud
La Valse des Depeches – Germaine Tailleferre
Marche funèbre – Arthur Honegger (in which he quotes the Waltz from Gounod's Faust)[3]
Quadrille – Tailleferre
Ritournelles – Auric
Sortie de la Noce – Milhaud.[3][7]
Recordings[edit]
The score was unpublished until the first full recording of the work in 1966, which was supervised by Darius Milhaud.[1]
Les Mariés was performed by the Delft student music company ""Krashna Musika"" in Delft, the Netherlands, on 2 May 1975, as part of the Student Music Festival ""Muzikaal Totaal"", conceived by Guus Ranke. It was repeated on 23 May 1975, in theatre ""De Junushof"" in Wageningen, The Netherlands. Both performances were in Dutch. The Wageningen edition was recorded, and can be obtained via Krashna Musika / KRAK from June 2020 on.
The ballet has also been recorded more recently by the Philharmonia Orchestra under Geoffrey Simon.
In 1987, Marius Constant arranged the music for an ensemble of fifteen instruments: wind quintet, string quintet, trumpet, trombone, harp and two percussion.[3]  This version of the music has been recorded by the Erwartung Ensemble under Bernard Desgraupes, with Jean-Pierre Aumont and Raymond Gerome, narrators.[7]

Les Millions d'Arlequin (English: Harlequin's Millions) (Russian: ""Миллионы Арлекина"", Milliony Arlekina) also known under the title Harlequinade (Russian: ""Арлекинада"", Arlekinada) is a ballet comique in two acts and two tableaux with libretto and choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Riccardo Drigo. It was first presented at the Theatre of the Imperial Hermitage Museum by the Imperial Ballet in Saint Petersburg on 23 February [O.S. 10 February] 1900.[1] The ballet was given a second premiere with the same cast at the Imperial Mariinsky Theatre on 26 February [O.S. 13 February] 1900.
The Sérénade from the first act of the ballet became a popular repertory piece that has been arranged for various instruments and recorded on numerous occasions.



History[edit]
Ivan Vsevolozhsky took up the directorship of the Imperial Hermitage Museum in 1899, a post that required supervision over performances given at the museum's theatre. Vsevolozhsky commissioned Marius Petipa—Premier maître de ballet of the Saint Petersburg Imperial Theatres—to create three short ballets for the 1900–1901 season that would be performed privately for the imperial russian court. Petipa crafted the librettos for these ballets himself: the one-act Les Ruses d'amour (The Pranks of Love), with a scenario inspired by french rococo; the one-act Les Saisons (The Seasons), a ballet-divertissement featuring dance episodes inspired by the four seasons; and Les Millions d'Arlequin, a two-act work based on the stock characters from the Italian Commedia dell'arte.
Les Millions d'Arlequin was first performed on a double bill after two acts of Alexander Serov's opera Judith at the Imperial Theatre of the Hermitage Museum on 23 February [O.S. 10 February] 1900. In the principal roles were Mathilde Kschessinskaya as Columbine, Georgy Kyaksht as Harlequin, Olga Preobrajenskaya as Pierrette, Sergei Lukianov as Pierrot, Enrico Cecchetti as Cassandre, Nikolai Aistov as Leandre, and Anna Urakova as the Good Fairy.
This performance was a private occasion given for the Imperial Russian court. Among the audience was the Emperor Nicholas II, the Empress Alexandra, and the Dowager Empress Maria. Private royal theatrical performances of that time were extremely formal affairs where rigid etiquette and protocol were strictly adhered to, and as such applause or cheering were not permitted. Nevertheless, within moments of the final curtain the typically subdued royal audience began to applaud, with the ballet master Petipa and the cast receiving an enthusiastic ovation as they took their bows before the curtain. But much to the surprise of everyone present, the composer Drigo received such a reception after the performance that he was mobbed by several princes and Grand Dukes who tripped over one another in their enthusiasm to congratulate him for his music. The Empress Alexandra admired the ballet, and commanded two additional court performances, this time on the stage of the Mariinsky Theatre, the first being given on 26 February [O.S. 13 February] 1900.
Les Millions d'Arlequin became a popular work in the repertory of the Imperial Ballet. Marius Petipa's original production was given its final performances in the 1920's. 

Later productions[edit]
In 1933 the ballet master Fyodor Lopukhov staged Les Millions d'Arlequin as Arlekinada for the newly formed Maly Theatre Ballet of Leningrad. Lopukhov's version was a redacted version in one-act with costumes and décor designed by the artist Tatiana Bruni. The premiere on June 6, 1933 was the company's first performance as the Maly Theatre's official dance troupe. Lopukhov's production of Arlekinada was performed by the company until the 1990s, and was filmed on two occasions for Russian television. Lopukhov's version would go on to be staged by various companies and schools throughout Russia. 

The New York City Ballet's production by George Balanchine[edit]
In honor of the 65th anniversary of Les Millions d'Arlequin, George Balanchine created his own version of the ballet for the New York City Ballet as Harlequinade. This production premiered at the New York State Theater in New York City on 4 February 1965 with Patricia McBride as Columbine, Edward Villella as Harlequin, Suki Schorer as Pierrette and Deni Lamont as Pierrot. The New York City Ballet still perform Harlequinade to the present day.

Alexei Ratmansky's reconstruction[edit]
Marius Petipa's choreography for Les Millions d'Arlequin was recorded in the Stepanov method of choreographic notation not long after its premiere in 1900. Today, this notation is part of the Sergeyev Collection at Harvard University. In 2018, the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky utilized the notation of Les Millions d'Arlequin to stage a reconstruction of the Imperial Ballet's original production for American Ballet Theatre, with the designer Robert Perdziola creating décor and costumes based on the ballet's original production of 1900. Ratmansky's production was staged as Harlequinade and premiered on June 4, 2018 at the Metropolitan Opera House. The production was very successful and was later staged for the Australian Ballet in 2022.

Publication of the music[edit]
After the premiere of Les Millions d'Arlequin in 1900, plans were underway by the music publisher Zimmermann to issue Riccardo Drigo's score in both piano reduction and orchestral partition. Riccardo Drigo recounts in his memoirs of how his colleagues urged the composer to dedicate his score to the Empress Alexandra. This required the composer to submit a request for the dedication to the Minister of the Imperial Court, which brought about a lengthy correspondence by a commission set up to investigate whether or not the composer's character and background were worthy of his offering a dedication to a Russian Empress. In the end the response was favorable and the dedication was graciously accepted.

The ""Sérénade""[edit]
Frontispiece for the piano reduction of the Sérénade from Riccardo Drigo's score for Les Millions d'Arlequin as issued by the music publisher Zimmermann, 1901
The first act of Les Millions d'Arlequin includes a scene  called La Sérénade where the character Columbine appears on the balcony of her house and is serenaded from the street by the character Harlequin and his friends.
The music became a popular excerpt in its own right and would go on to become a staple of Edwardian Era salon music/light music. The piece was published in several arrangements for various instruments under many different titles such as Valse Boston or Serenatina veneziana (Venetian Serenade). The Sérénade was among the pieces in the White Star Line songbook, and was played by the Musicians of the RMS Titanic.
The Sérénade was later adapted into the song Notturno d'amore (Nocturne of Love) by the lyricist S. Focacci in 1922. The Italian tenor Beniamino Gigli made a worldwide hit with his recording of the song in 1926.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


My Brother, My Sisters is a one-act ballet created by Kenneth MacMillan in 1974 for the Stuttgart Ballet, under the title Mein Bruder, meine Schwestern. The music is by Arnold Schoenberg (Five Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 16) and Anton Webern (Five Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 10 and Six Pieces for Orchestra, Op. 6). The story is loosely based on the lives of the Brontë family. The designer was Yolanda Sonnabend, who had first collaborated with him on 1963's Symphony.[1]
The first performance was on 21 May 1978, at Stuttgart. MacMillan recreated the work for the Royal Ballet in April 1980 at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.[2]

Ballet by Igor Stravinsky
Les NocesChoreographerBronislava NijinskaMusicIgor StravinskyBased onRussian peasant weddingPremiere13 June 1923Théâtre de la Gaîté, ParisOriginal ballet companyBallets RussesDesignNatalia GoncharovaTypeballet-cantata
The Wedding, or Svadebka (Russian: Свадебка), is a Russian-language ballet-cantata by Igor Stravinsky scored unusually for four vocal soloists, chorus, percussion and four pianos. Dedicating the work to impresario Sergei Diaghilev, the composer described it in French as ""choreographed Russian scenes with singing and music"" [sic], and it remains known by its French name of Les noces despite being Russian.
The Wedding was completed in 1917 but was then subjected to a series of changes of heart by Stravinsky regarding its scoring; he settled on the above forces only in 1923, in time for the premiere in Paris on 13 June that year under conductor Ernest Ansermet and danced by the Ballets Russes to choreography by Bronislava Nijinska.[1] Several versions of the score have been performed over the years, substituting an orchestra for the percussion and pianos or using pianolas in accordance with a version Stravinsky abandoned.


Composition[edit]
Stravinsky conceived of The Wedding in 1913. By October 1917 he had completed it in short score to a libretto he himself had written using Russian wedding lyrics taken mainly from songs collected by Pyotr Kireevsky and published in 1911.
During this long gestation its orchestration changed dramatically. Stravinsky at first planned to use forces similar to those of The Rite of Spring. A later idea was to use synchronised roll-operated instruments, including the pianola; this he abandoned when partially completed because the Paris firm of Pleyel et Cie was late in constructing the two-keyboard cimbaloms, later known as luthéals, he required.[a]
Stravinsky settled only in 1923, six years after his short score, on the following forces: soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor and bass vocal soloists; mixed chorus; unpitched percussion; and pitched percussion, notably four pianos. The decision exemplified his growing penchant for stripped down, clear and mechanistic sound-groups in the decade after The Rite (although he was never again to produce such an extreme sonic effect solely with percussion).
He reminisced in 1962: ""When I first played The Wedding to Diaghilev … he wept and said it was the most beautiful and most purely Russian creation of our [ballet company]. I think he did love The Wedding more than any other work of mine. That is why it is dedicated to him.""[3]

Performances[edit]
The work was premiered on 13 June 1923 at the Théâtre de la Gaîté in Paris,[5] by the Ballets Russes with choreography by Bronislava Nijinska. The instrumental ensemble of four pianos and percussion was conducted by Ernest Ansermet. The work is usually performed in Russian or French; English translations are sometimes used, and Stravinsky used the English one on the recordings he conducted for Columbia Records in 1934 and 1959.
At the London premiere on 14 June 1926 at His Majesty's Theatre, the piano parts were played by composers Francis Poulenc, Georges Auric, Vittorio Rieti and Vernon Duke.[6] When Stravinsky conducted a recording using the English libretto in 1959, the four pianists were composers Samuel Barber, Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss, and Roger Sessions.[7] At a revival of the ballet in London's Covent Garden on 23 March 1962, four composers – John Gardner, Malcolm Williamson, Richard Rodney Bennett and Edmund Rubbra – played the piano parts.[8]
The premiere of the 1919 version of Les Noces, with cimbaloms, harmonium, and pianola, took place in 1981 in Paris, conducted by Pierre Boulez.[9]
The Los Angeles Philharmonic commissioned an arrangement by Steven Stucky for symphony orchestra and premiered it under the baton of Esa-Pekka Salonen on May 29, 2008, at Walt Disney Concert Hall. The arrangement retains Stravinsky's percussion parts while replacing the four pianos with a large orchestra.[citation needed]
The version including pianola that Stravinsky left unfinished was completed with permission from Stravinsky's heirs by the Dutch composer Theo Verbey and performed in the Netherlands in 2009.[10]
A new version of Les noces was performed by the English National Ballet at Sadler's Wells in September 2023, choreographed by Andrea Miller.[11]

Critical reception and legacy[edit]
Les Noces received a mixed reception to its early performances. While its premiere in Paris in 1923 was welcomed with enthusiasm,[12] the London performance three years later received such a negative response from critics that, according to Eric Walter White, ""The virulence of this attack so exasperated [the novelist] H. G. Wells that on June 18, 1926, he wrote an open letter."" Wells' letter, quoted by White, said: ""I do not know of any other ballet so interesting, so amusing, so fresh or nearly so exciting as Les Noces... That ballet is a rendering in sound and vision of the peasant soul, in its gravity, in its deliberate and simple-minded intricacy, in its subtly varied rhythms and deep undercurrents of excitement, that will astonish and delight every intelligent man or woman who goes to see it.""[13]
The pious reaction of Soviet critics such as Tikhon Khrennikov was no surprise: ""In Petrushka and Les Noces Stravinsky, with Diaghilev's blessing, uses Russian folk customs in order to mock at them in the interests of European audiences, which he does by emphasizing Asiatic primitivism, coarseness, and animal instincts, and deliberately introducing sexual motives. Ancient folk melodies are intentionally distorted as if seen in a crooked mirror.""[14] However, in 1929, Boris Asafyev, a musicologist less inclined to stick to the ""party line"" made a shrewd prediction: ""The young generation will find in the score of Noces an inexhaustible fountain of music and of new methods of musical formulation – a veritable primer of technical mastery.""[15]
The passage of time has indeed shown Les Noces to be one of Stravinsky's finest and most original achievements. Writing in 1988, Stephen Walsh said, ""Although others among Stravinsky's theatre works have enjoyed greater prestige … The Wedding is in many respects the most radical, the most original and conceivably the greatest of them all.""[16]
Howard Goodall has pointed out the influence of the distinctive sonorities of Les Noces: ""To other composers, though, as they gradually came across Les Noces, its peculiar faux-primitive, fierce sound proved irresistible... The sound world of Les Noces is, quite simply, the most imitated of all twentieth-century combinations outside the fields of jazz and popular music."" Goodall lists composers that have fallen under its influence such as Orff, Bartók, Messiaen and many others, including film composers.[17]
In her memoir of working as Stravinsky's agent during the final decade of his life, Lilian Libman recalls the composer's particular fondness for the work: ""Still, did he have a favorite as a father has a favorite son?... I think it was Les Noces... It drew him, it would seem, as no other work of his had done. During the time I knew him, the mention of Les Noces never failed to produce the same smile with which he greeted those for whom he felt great affection.""[18]

Notable recordings[edit]
A 1934 recording conducted by Stravinsky using the English libretto has been reissued on CD by EMI as part of their ""Composers in Person"" series.
Stravinsky conducted a second recording, also in English, in 1959, with soloists Mildred Allen (s); Regina Sarfaty (m-s); Loren Driscoll (t); Robert Oliver (b); American Concert Choir; pianists Samuel Barber, Aaron Copland, Lukas Foss, Roger Sessions; Columbia Percussion Ensemble; re-issued by Sony Classical in 2016.
Robert Craft recorded the early versions of Les Noces in the early 1970s on a Columbia LP, with pianos instead of pianolas.
The Dmitri Pokrovsky Ensemble issued a recording with much of the piano writing sequenced via MIDI through Macintosh computers.
BBC Radio 3's recommended recording is that made in 1990 by the Voronezh Chamber Choir, New London Chamber Choir, Ensemble, James Wood (director) Hyperion CDA 66410.[19]
Leonard Bernstein conducted the English Bach Festival Orchestra and Chorus on a recording for Deutsche Grammophon in 1977, with Martha Argerich, Krystian Zimerman, Cyprien Katsaris, and Homero Francesch as the pianists.
Radio France recorded the work in 2011 on a SACD, with Virginie Pesch, Katalin Varkonyi, Pierre Vaello, and Vincent Menez; Percussions de l'Orchestre National de France & de la SMCQ de Montréal; Chœur de Radio France; René Bosc, conductor; Harmonia Mundi – Musicora; ASIN: B00699QPNM.[20] This recording includes both the 1923 and the 1919 versions by Stravinsky, the latter featuring two cimbaloms, a harmonium and a pianola, instead of the four pianos.
Choreography[edit]
Bronislava Nijinska's choreographic interpretation of Les Noces has been called protofeminist.[21] Les Noces deserts the upbeat nature of a typical wedding, and instead brings to life the restrictive nature of a woman's duty to marry. The dark and somber set provides the backdrop to the simple costuming and rigid movements. The individuality of the dancer is stripped away in Nijinska's choreography, therefore displaying actors on a predetermined path, as marriage was regarded as the way to maintain and grow the community. The choreography exudes symbolism as, huddled together, the women repeatedly strike the floor with their pointe shoes with rigid intensity, as if to tell the tale of their struggle and ultimate reverence. The Russian peasant culture and the dutifulness it evokes in its people is represented in Nijinska's piece.

Notes[edit]


^ The idea that it is impossible or difficult to synchronise a pianola with other instruments is erroneous. There have been hundreds of concerts in which the pianola has accompanied chamber music or been used as the solo instrument in concertos, beginning in 1900, when Luigi Kunits, concertmaster of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, was accompanied by pianolist Charles Parkyn. One example is the Rachmaninoff Third Piano Concerto with the Flemish Radio Orchestra in Brussels, with newly arranged rolls perforated in March 2007.[2]

OneginRoberta Marquez and Thiago Soares  in OneginChoreographerJohn CrankoMusicPyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky arrangements by Kurt-Heinz StolzeBased onEugene Onegin by Alexander PushkinPremiere13 April 1965[1]Staatstheater StuttgartOriginal ballet companyStuttgart BalletSetting19th-century Russia
Onegin is a ballet created by John Cranko for the Stuttgart Ballet, premiered on 13 April 1965 at Staatstheater Stuttgart. The ballet was based on  Alexander Pushkin's 1825-1832 novel Eugene Onegin, to music by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and arrangements by Kurt-Heinz Stolze. The ballet had since been in the repertoires of The Australian Ballet, National Ballet of Canada, American Ballet Theatre and The Royal Ballet.[2][1][3]


Background and production[edit]
Cranko first discovered Alexander Pushkin's verse-novel Eugene Onegin when he choreographed the dances for Tchaikovsky's opera of the same name in 1952. He first proposed a ballet based on Pushkin's story to the Royal Opera House board in the 1960s, but it was turned down, and he pursued the idea when he moved to Stuttgart. The Stuttgart Ballet premiered the work in 1965. The Royal Ballet did not present the work until 2001.[4] The choreography for his ballet includes a wide range of styles, including folk, modern, ballroom and acrobatic. The music takes inspiration from the composer he worked with when he was first introduced to the story – Kurt-Heinz Stolze arranged music by Tchaikovsky, which came principally from his piano works rather than his orchestral works, to accompany the dancers.[5][n 1] The original principals were Marcia Haydée as Tatiana, Ray Barra as Onegin, Egon Madsen as Lensky and Ana Cardus as Olga.[7]
Between 1965 and 1967 Cranko revised Onegin several times. His scenario originally ended with Tatiana kissing her children goodnight, which he decided lessened the drama of her final encounter with Onegin. Cranko also deleted the prologue, in which Onegin was seen at his uncle's deathbed. The standard version of the ballet was first performed by the Stuttgart company in October 1967.[6]
Onegin was added to The Australian Ballet's repertoire in 1976, first performed by Marilyn Rowe and John Meehan.[2] Some dancers are coached by Haydée.[8] The National Ballet of Canada first performed Onegin in 1984 in Toronto, Veronica Tennant and Luc Amyot were originally scheduled to star in the National Ballet of Canada premiere, but withdrew due to injuries. Sabina Allemann and Frank Augustyn replaced them.[9] The production was staged by then Stuttgart Ballet principal dancer Reid Anderson. Anderson himself performed in with the National Ballet alongside Karen Kain the following year.[10]
The American Ballet Theatre debuted Onegin in 2001 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Tatiana and Onegin are danced by Julie Kent and Robert Hill . Later that year, The Royal Ballet made their company premiere, with Tamara Rojo and Adam Cooper as the lead roles. Both productions are staged by Anderson and choreologist Jane Bourne.[1][11] The Paris Opera Ballet first performed Onegin in 2009, starring Hervé Moreau and Isabelle Ciaravola. Both Ciaravola and Mathias Heymann, who played Lensky, were named étoile at the curtain call of that performance.[12]
As the sets and costumes became fragile, the National Ballet invited Santo Loquasto to redesign the production, which debuted in 2010.[13] ABT started using Loquasto's design in 2012.[1] Other companies that had danced Onegin include Houston Ballet, Boston Ballet, Hamburg Ballet, Berlin State Ballet and La Scala Theatre Ballet.[14]

Synopsis[edit]
Setting: 1820s, Russia
Act 1
Madame Larina's garden
In the garden, Madame Larina, her daughters Olga and Tatiana, and the nurse are finishing party dresses and discussing Tatiana's upcoming birthday celebrations. They think about the future, and the local girls play an old folk game: whoever looks into the mirror will see her beloved. Lensky, a young poet engaged to Olga, arrives with a friend from Saint Petersburg. He introduces Eugene Onegin, who has come to the country to see if it can offer him any distraction from city life. Tatiana falls in love with the handsome stranger, who seems so different from the country people she knows, while Onegin only sees a naive, romantic girl.
Tatiana's bedroom
That night, Tatiana dreams of Onegin, her first love.  She writes him a passionate love letter, which she asks her nurse to deliver.
Act 2
Tatiana's birthday
The local gentry have all arrived to celebrate Tatiana's birthday.  Onegin finds the company boring and is struggling to be polite.  He is also annoyed by Tatiana's letter, which he thinks is just an outburst of adolescent love.  He seeks Tatiana out and tears up her letter, telling her that he cannot love her.  Prince Gremin, a distant relative of Tatiana who is in love with her, appears. Madame Larina hopes they will make a good match, but Tatiana hardly notices him as she is so distressed.  Onegin decides to provoke Lensky by flirting with Olga, hoping it will relieve his boredom.  Olga joins in with the joke, but Lensky takes it seriously and challenges Onegin to a duel.
The duel
Tatiana and Olga try to reason with Lensky but he insists the duel must go ahead.  Onegin kills his friend.
Act 3
St Petersburg
Years later, Onegin returns to St. Petersburg after travelling the world.  He goes to a ball at the palace of Prince Gremin.  Onegin is surprised when he recognises the beautiful Princess Tatiana as the country girl he once turned away.  He realises how much he lost through his previous actions.
Tatiana's boudoir
Onegin writes to Tatiana and reveals his love.  He asks to see her but she does not wish to see him.  She pleads with her husband not to leave her alone that evening.  Onegin comes and declares his love for her.  Tatiana feels Onegin's change of heart has come too late. And even if she still loves him she has now a new life with Prince Gremin and also after having killed Lensky she would never want Onegin again. She tears up his letter and orders him to leave her forever.[15]

Reception[edit]
After the Stuttgart premiere the ballet critic of The Times rated the piece enjoyable but not wholly successful. He found the score unmemorable and the characters sketchy: ""Solitary introverts are difficult to depict in dancing"".[7] By 1974, when the Stuttgart company presented the piece at Covent Garden shortly after Cranko's death, the critic John Percival reassessed the work much more favourably, praising both the music and the narrative expertise of the choreography.[19] The work has continued to divide critical opinion. In 2004 The Independent called it ""a weak piece [missing] the story's depth, its psychological understanding"".[20] Three years later the critic in The Sunday Times found that the work's ""acutely expressive choreography ... never fails to enthral... Cranko's handling of the Pushkin story as dance is masterly.""[21] Other comments have included ""compelling but dramatically flawed"",[22] ""magnificent ... a neck-pricking five-star triumph,[23] ""stodgily operatic""[24] and ""a sad, beautiful ballet, a true romance with four finely drawn leading characters and a grown-up poignance rarely found.""[25]

Music score[edit]
For the music score to Onegin, Cranko invited German musician and conductor Kurt-Heinz Stolze (then the Kapellmeister for Stuttgart Ballet) to arrange and orchestrate a compilation of solo piano and orchestral pieces from different compositions by Tchaikovsky. Stolze used selections from five solo piano opuses (from The Seasons, Op. 37a, Op. 19, and Op. 72), selections from the opera Cherevichki, Op. 9 (as a main musical theme for Tatiana and Onegin), the symphonic fantasy Francesca da Rimini, Op. 32, the symphonic ballad The Voyevoda, Op. 3, a duet from the incomplete opera Romeo and Juliet, and Impromptu from Two Piano Pieces, Op. 1.

Videography[edit]
In 2017, Stuttgart Ballet released a DVD, featuring Alicia Amatriain as Tatiana, Friedemann Vogel as Onegin, David Moore as Lensky and Elisa Badenes as Olga, Marcia Haydée, who originated the role of Tatiana, appeared as Tatiana's and Olga's nurse.[18] In light of the impact of the COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic on the performing arts, Stuttgart Ballet released the recording online.[26]

Emma Livry as Farfalla in the ballet Le papillon, Paris, 1861
Le papillon (The Butterfly) is a 'fantastic ballet' in two acts (four scenes) of 1860, with choreography by Marie Taglioni and music by Jacques Offenbach to a libretto by Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges.


Performance history[edit]
Le papillon was first presented by the Paris Opera Ballet at the Salle Le Peletier on November 26, 1860 after a performance of Lucie de Lammermoor.[1] The principal dancers were Emma Livry (Farfalla/the Butterfly), Louis Mérante (Prince Djalma), Louise Marquet (Fairy Hamza), and Mme. Simon (Diamond Fairy). The premiere and second performance were attended by Napoléon III.[2]
The Valse des rayons from the second scene of Act 1 was re-used by Offenbach in the third act ballet for Die Rheinnixen (1864)[3] and parts of the score were inserted in the French version of Whittington, Le Chat du diable (1893).[1] The solo for Le docteur Miracle ""Eh! oui, je vous entends !"" in the Antonia act of Les Contes d'Hoffmann originated as a Bohémiana in Le papillon.[4] The Valse des rayons also became an Apache Dance at the Moulin Rouge in Paris, and was used in the musical Showboat in 1927 as part of the Trocadero scene.[2]
Marius Petipa created an expanded staging in four acts for the Imperial Ballet with Ludwig Minkus adapting Offenbach's score. It was first presented in January 1874 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg with Ekaterina Vazem (Farfalla/the Butterfly), Lev Ivanov (Prince Djalma), Pavel Gerdt (Patimate), Mathil'da Madaeva (Fairy Hamza), and Lubov Radina (Diamond Fairy). Petipa added a variation to the Grand pas des papillons to a waltz by Luigi Venzano especially for Ekaterina Vazem – this variation became known as the Pas Vazem, and was much celebrated among the balletomanes of Saint Petersburg.
Having begun work on reconstruction of the original with the second act pas de deux for Paris in 1977 (partnered by Dominique Khalfouni) based on contemporary critical accounts,[2] the full ballet was revived by Pierre Lacotte at the Rome Opera in 1982.[1]
The score was used for a ballet entitled Utopia directed by Elsa-Marianne von Rosen for the Gothenburg ballet company in 1974. Having decided against making his own version of the full ballet, Frederick Ashton selected pieces from the score for a pas de deux entitled Scène dansante, first performed by Merle Park and David Wall in Aldeburgh in 1975 and then at a charity gala at the Adelphi Theatre London in 1977.[2]
Ronald Hynd prepared a production for Houston Ballet with his own adapted scenario and the score re-orchestrated by John Lanchbery, which premiered on 8 February 1979 and was also danced by the Johannesburg company PACT. It entered the repertoire of the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet in Leeds on 7 February 1980.[5] Described as Hynd's tribute to Emma Livry, the plot was pared down and reset in Persia with many of the transformations and comic situations retained.[6] But, compared to the original 1860 material, the score is largely altered by Lanchberry who integrates his own composition inside the main musical corpus, while changing the numbers order and deleting a lot of the original Offenbach's score.

Synopsis[edit]
Design by Hugues Martin for Act 1 tableau 1 of Le papillon
The ballet is set in Circassia.[7] After the Prelude, the first tableau of Act 1 opens with the evil old fairy Hamza treating her servant roughly. Hamza once abducted the Emir's daughter Farfalla who now serves as her maid. Looking in the mirror Hamza wishes only to become young again and eligible to marry, but to do this she must be kissed by a young prince.
Resting from a hunt Prince Djalma and his entourage enter. Everyone enjoys the food and wine, although the tutor thinks Farfalla that is the once kidnapped princess. The prince dances a mazurka with the maid and thanks her with a kiss. The tipsy Hamza is teased by the others and flies into a rage, lures Farfalla into a box and, using her magic crutch, when the box opens again, a beautiful butterfly emerges. Butterflies flutter into the room from doors, windows and even the chimney before being chased out by Hamza.

Marquet as the Fairy Hamza
After the Prince and his entourage have left Hamza's castle they reach a forest clearing, where shortly the butterflies fly in. When one of the butterflies is pinned to a tree by the prince, it suddenly turns into a crying girl. It falls to the ground unconscious and on inspection appears to be the prince's dance partner of earlier. But it recovers and re-joins the others.
Hamza now arrives in the clearing with her gardener. With her magic crutch she locates her maid among the butterflies and tries to catch her in a net. But leaving her magic wand unattended for a moment her gardener Patimate tries to help Farfalla. He touches his mistress with the wand and she is frozen on the spot, upon which the butterflies hasten to capture Hamza in the net. Meanwhile Patimate tells Djalma about Farfalla's real identity. However, he forgets to take the magic wand and a leprechaun steals in grabs it and rushes away. The prince carries the fairy off to his uncle's palace.
Act 2 opens at the palace of the emir Ismaël, where the happy Djalma and Farfalla arrive in a golden carriage. It emerges that Farfalla is in fact his daughter and can marry his nephew Djalma. 
However, when the prince tries to embrace his love Farfalla reminds him how not long before he wanted to impale a butterfly to a tree. Djalma tries again to kiss her, but Hamza, lurking nearby throws herself between them and obtains the kiss meant for Farfalla. The spell works for Hamza and she is turned into a beautiful young girl. Prince Djalma is confused to see the two beautiful women. He courts the rejuvenated fairy, hoping to make Farfalla throws herself into his arms, but Hamza flies into a rage and sends the prince into a magnetic sleep, while Farfalla is changed back into a butterfly. The palace of the Emir is transformed into a park.
The last tableau, in grandiose gardens, has Djalma awakening, and he finds himself surrounded by a swarm of butterflies, including his beloved Farfalla. Hamza enters with her four sisters boasting of her exploits, and secretly dreaming of marrying the prince. As a rehearsal for such an event she summons a band of golden harps, and a torch carrier. Farfalla is attracted by the glow of the torch, but in touching the lamp she burns her wings and the charm fades: she regains her human form and collapses into the arms of the prince. Hamza's sisters then break the magic crutch and together transform Hamza into a statue. The wedding with Djalma now has no more obstacles and the young couple can marry in the fairy palace which appears in the gardens.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Ballet by Sergei Prokofiev
Sergei Prokofiev
Le pas d'acier (The Steel Step or The Leap of Steel; Russian: Стальной скок), Op. 41, is a 1926 ballet in two scenes containing eleven dances composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Prokofiev also created a four-movement orchestral suite from the ballet (Op. 41b).[1]


Origin[edit]
G. Yakulov. Scene model for the ballet Le pas d'acier (1927)
The ballet was commissioned by impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who had been greatly impressed by the exhibition in Paris in 1925 of Russian contemporary artists at the International Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts, and was originally intended to ""celebrate Soviet  industrialization.""[2] Prokofiev wrote the score, based on a scenario by the Constructivist artist Georgi Yakulov and himself, in 1925–1926, much of it during his tour of the United States.[3] Prokofiev wrote that his music represented ""a move towards a Russian musical language, not that of the Fairy Tales of [the folklorist] Afanasyev, but one which could describe contemporary life. [...It] was a decisive step leading me towards chromaticism and diatonics [...] A whole series of themes is composed solely for the white keys.""[4]
The original scenario was titled Ursignol, and was approved by Diaghilev in the autumn of 1925.[5]  It appears however that over the next two years the story-line was changed, against Yakulov's wishes, as Diaghilev made preparations for the first production.[6]  The original scenario was rooted in scenes of Soviet life, of which Yakulov had experience (but the émigrés Prokofiev and Diaghilev did not), involving speculators, sailors and workers, and with scenes in a station, a market and a factory, centered on life in the early Soviet Union.[7] The factory scene features machines and sprocketed wheels as the setting for a danced romance between a sailor and a young girl worker.
It is interesting that in the factory scene the chromatic ostinato figure of the viola is nearly the same as the one of Mosolov's contemporary ""Iron Foundry"".

Premiere[edit]
Although no record of the choreography of the eventual 1927 production has survived, it is clear from the comments of critics that the scenario had been altered from the original so as to include scenes of Russian folklore, which were a typical element of Ballets Russes productions.[8] With choreography by Léonide Massine, the Ballets Russes premiered the work in Paris at the Théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt on June 7, 1927.[9] Critical reaction was extremely mixed. The critic André Levinson wrote:In this architectural decor agitates a poor drama, undecided between enthusiasm for Bolshevism and bitter irony. Only the musician was carried away in depth by the material  – for the rest, is it a homage or a parody? Is it for real or cynical derision? Must one laugh or cry? Neither one nor the other, it seems to me, the superficial eccentricity conceals the pain of a fundamental emptiness and a dishonest conception.[10]
Richard Taruskin notes that Igor Stravinsky, (from whose Rite of Spring Taruskin claims the Le pas d'acier ""poached a bit""), ""declared that it made him ill.""[11]
Wilhelm Furtwangler conducted a suite from the ballet in concert with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1929.

Performance history[edit]
Le pas d'acier was a major success for Prokofiev and Diaghilev in Paris, where it was performed for three consecutive seasons. Diaghilev was a confirmed supporter of Prokofiev's compositions, going so far as to term him ""my second son"" (Stravinsky being his metaphorical ""first""), and Diaghilev's death in 1929 removed Prokofiev's primary source of ballet commissions and practical support in the field in Paris and the West.[12] The ballet was performed under new choreography and cast at the Bolshoi Theatre with the help of Prokofiev's friend Boris Gusan. It was also performed in London and, in 1931, in the USA, where the Philadelphia Public Ledger commented ""one wonders whether [the ballet] is propaganda or music.""[13]

Revival[edit]
After 1931, the next performance of the ballet was in 2005, when it was staged at Princeton University, New Jersey. This production was described as ""faithful to the original, never-performed concept of a celebration of Soviet workers' lives, instead of a mockery of them, which was the version seen by audiences of the early 20th century.""[14]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Requiem is a one-act ballet created by Kenneth MacMillan in 1976 for the  Stuttgart Ballet. The music is Gabriel Fauré's Requiem (1890). The designer was Yolanda Sonnabend, who had first collaborated with him on 1963's Symphony.[1]
In MacMillan's words, ""This danced Requiem is dedicated to the memory of my friend and colleague John Cranko, Director of the Stuttgart Ballet 1961–1973."" The first performance was given at Stuttgart on 28 November 1976. MacMillan recreated the piece for the Royal Ballet, London, at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden on 3 March 1983.[2]
MacMillan's decision to set a ballet to Fauré's Requiem met with opposition from the board of the Royal Ballet. Catholic members of the board felt that sacred music should not be used for ballet. MacMillan wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury to seek his opinion. Although the response was favourable to MacMillan the board remained unpersuaded. MacMillan then contacted the artistic director of the Stuttgart Ballet who had previously expressed an interest in commissioning a ballet from him. They reacted with enthusiasm.[3] The piece was a portrait of the ballet company coming to terms with the death of Cranko, their much-loved artistic director.[4]
Many of the choreographic images in Requiem were based on drawings and paintings by William Blake, including illustrations for Dante's Inferno, Milton's Paradise Lost and the Old Testament Book of Job.[3] The ballet begins with a group of mourners entering to the accompaniment of the Introitus. A central figure is raised aloft like an offering. She then dances two pas de deux with different men during the Offertorium and the Sanctus, returning to comfort a young woman during the Agnus Dei. In the final section, In Paradisum, the women appear from the wings before all the dancers leave the stage bathed in light and with their backs to the audience.[4]
The ballet was met with acclaim by audiences and critics. Stuttgart Ballet had exclusive rights to perform the ballet for six years, after which it entered the repertory of the Royal Ballet in 1983.[3]

Reception[edit]
Reviewing the Stuttgart premiere for The Times, John Percival rated the piece as MacMillan's best ballet to date, and criticised the Royal Ballet for failing to secure the piece for itself.[5] When the work was staged at Covent Garden in 1983 Percival again praised it, though he was less convinced by the company's dancing, much of which he found too reserved.[6] In The Observer, Jann Parry wrote of, ""A beautiful ballet, reminding us that MacMillan can use a corps de ballet as a community rather than a crowd of extras.""[7] In Dance Now in 2002 the former Royal Ballet dancer Bruce Sansom, who had appeared in three roles in the work over the years, wrote that the merging of human voices, orchestral playing, and dance was a powerful combination, and that MacMillan ""draws them seamlessly together offering equal fulfillment for viewer and performer"".[8]

RhapsodyChoreographerFrederick AshtonMusicSergei RachmaninoffPremiere4 August 1980 (1980-08-04)Royal Opera HouseOriginal ballet companyThe Royal BalletDesignWilliam ChappellFrederick AshtonCreated forLesley CollierMikhail BaryshnikovGenreNeoclassical ballet
Rhapsody is a one-act ballet choreographed by Frederick Ashton to Rachmaninoff's Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. The ballet was made for both Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother's 80th birthday, and Mikhail Baryshnikov's guest appearance with the Royal Ballet. It premiered on 4 August 1980, at the Royal Opera House, with the two principal roles danced by Baryshnikov and Lesley Collier. The ballet is dedicated to the Queen Mother.


Choreography[edit]
Ashton had stated that his inspiration was ""not just from the nineteenth-century classics, but from classicism."" He added, ""I've worked to develop my classicism so as to enrich and fit in with the repertory of a classical company.""[1] The ballet is danced by a principal couple and a corps de ballet of six men and six women.[2] The lead male role resembles the virtuosic Russian ballet style.[2] Some critics interpret this role as the embodiment of the violin.[2] The female principal role is in the British ballet style. She only enters the stage half-way through the ballet.[2] The contrast becomes less obvious when the principal male role is danced by Royal Ballet-trained dancers.[3]: 537  The two mostly dance separately, but the moments when they are together have been compared to Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.[2] While the two leads are the main focus of the ballet, the ensemble also has its own dances.[2]

Production[edit]
Ashton first choreographed to Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini for Vincente Minnelli and Gottfried Reinhardt's 1953 film The Story of Three Loves. The dance was featured in the story ""The Jealous Lover.""[4]: 258 [3]: 372  The scene features the character portrayed by Moira Shearer, dancing what she ""supposedly improvised,"" before the corps de ballet joins her. Ashton had stated that he ""hates"" the set-up.[1] However, he was still interested in the music years later.[4]: 410 
Ashton finally choreographed to the same score again in 1980. According to him, Princess Margaret approached him about ""doing something"" for the 80th birthday of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, with whom Ashton was friendly.[3]: 536  Coincidentally, Mikhail Baryshnikov was invited to make guest appearances at the Royal Ballet in July and August 1980. However, he did not want to dance classical ballets, and would only perform with the company if Ashton would choreograph a new ballet for him.[1] Ashton had already wanted to create a ballet for Baryshnikov in 1977, after the latter's performance as Colas in the former's La fille mal gardée with the Royal Ballet.[1] Ashton said, ""with a gun held at my head and the Queen Mother's birthday, I pulled out the plugs,"" and decided to choreograph to Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini.[3]: 536 
Lesley Collier was cast as the female lead. She said she was not sure why she was chosen as she believed she was ""not an inspiring dancer."" She added, ""With me [Ashton] has to work and work to find something – he has to start completely from scratch."" However, she also said that her speed might be why she was cast.[1] Six men and six women, all younger members of the company, were chosen as the corps de ballet.[4]: 411  Rhapsody was Ashton's first ballet in many years without the involvement of Michael Somes, instead, Christopher Newton was chosen as the répétiteur, a decision with which Somes disagreed.[3]: 537 
Ashton began choreographing Rhapsody in May 1980. Baryshnikov, however, was only able to arrive in June. Ashton therefore could not work on the ballet chronologically, as he would have preferred.[4]: 411  Since he usually mapped out the structures of his works, he was able to work around Baryshnikov.[4]: 411  The actual steps were determined once Ashton started working with the dancers, as he wanted ""the feeling of spontaneity to the movement"".[1] However, Collier had a knee injury, so Ashton had to work around her too. By the time Baryshnikov arrived, the ballet had been outlined. Baryshnikov had a small injury that delayed production for a few days.[4]: 411  The choreography of the ballet was completed in late July.[1]
Baryshnikov had hoped that by dancing with the Royal Ballet, he would learn the British ballet style. However, Ashton had him dance in the Russian style, for which Baryshnikov was ""a bit disappointed,"" as he ""was trying to escape all those steps.""[3]: 537  Ashton told him that if he disliked the steps, they could be tweaked, though Baryshnikov did not request any changes to the choreography. Recalling working with Ashton, Collier said, ""[Ashton] does not tell you what's on his mind... he lets it remain a mystery and it's better that way, because then it can change."" However, Ashton did tell her about the past dancers who inspired her role, which was ""his way of giving you his vision.""[4]: 411  On working with Baryshnikov, Ashton said, ""Baryshnikov contributes so much. He's a marvellous dancer, of course. He rings some of his sensational steps and I modify them or develop them to suit the moment. One works with the material they present.""[1]
The original set was devised by Ashton, inspired by 18th-century arches. William Chappell, an old friend of Ashton, designed the costumes, though he disagreed with Ashton's feedback so much that they ""were practically passing notes to each other by the end.""[3]: 537  In 1995, the original costumes and sets were replaced by new ones by Patrick Caulfield.[4]: 515–516  They were redesigned in 2005, this time by Jessica Curtis.[5] In 2016, the costumes and sets were reverted to the original designs.[6]
Rhapsody is ""by gracious permission"" dedicated to the Queen Mother.[3]: 537

Performances[edit]
Rhapsody premiered on 4 August 1980, during the Queen Mother's birthday gala, at the Royal Opera House.[1][2] The performance was attended by the Queen and the Queen Mother.[3]: 539 
In 1996, the Paris Opera Ballet debuted Rhapsody.[4]: 515–516  Sarasota Ballet and K-ballet had also performed the ballet.[7][8]

Reception[edit]
Writing for the Dancing Times, David Vaughan wrote that Rhapsody ""is no mere gala party piece."" He added that the ballet ""is in the same lineage in the Ashton canon as Les Rendezvous, Symphonic Variations, Scenes de Ballet,"" as well as Monotones and Birthday Offering.[4]: 411–412  Arlene Croce of The New Yorker criticised the work: ""Although the expansive material suits the melodramatic Rachmaninoff score, it effectively separates Baryshnikov from the rest of the cast and from the Royal Ballet style."" She also wrote that ""Baryshnikov doesn't look fresh in Rhapsody. Ashton has indulged an image of him which he has outgrown.""[9]

La Rose, la violette et le papillon (The Rose, the Violet, and the Butterfly) is a ballet divertissement in one act, with choreography by Marius Petipa, and music by Duke Peter Georgievich of Oldenburg. The libretto was by Jules Perrot.
First presented by the Imperial Ballet on 20 October [O.S. 8 October] 1857, for the Imperial court at the theatre of Tsarskoe Selo, St. Petersburg, Russia, a second premiere was given by the Imperial Ballet on 1 November [O.S. 20 October] 1857.  at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre, St. Petersburg, Russia. The Principal Dancers were Mariia Surovshchikova-Petipa (the Rose), Matilda Madaeva (the Violet), and Marfa Muravieva (as the Butterfly).

Plot outline[edit]
A rose and a violet have both become enamoured by a gorgeous butterfly who flutters around them, paying court to their sweet embrace. The blossoms attempt to succeed the other with their floral charms, however at the end of these proceedings, the butterfly chooses to fly away rather than exclude one over the other.

Trivia[edit]
When this ballet was given its second premiere at the St. Petersburg Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre October 20/November 1, 1857, the choreography was incorrectly credited to the Balletmaster Jules Perrot in the theatre program.
Music from this ballet was interpolated into Petipa and Perrot's 1858 revival of Le Corsaire, in which it was titled the Pas d'Esclave. The piece has remained a part of the performance tradition of Le Corsaire to the present day.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


Roxana, the Beauty of Montenegro (Russian: Roksana, krasa Chernogorii, also known as Roxana) is a fantastic ballet in four acts, with choreography by Marius Petipa and music by Ludwig Minkus.[1][2] Libretto by Sergei Khudekov and Marius Petipa.
The ballet was first presented by the Imperial Ballet on January 29/February 11 (Julian/Gregorian calendar dates), 1878 at the Imperial Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in St. Petersburg, Russia, with Eugeniia Sokolova as Roxana, shortly after Montenegro was liberated by the Russian army from the Ottoman Empire.[3]
The ballet historian Konstantin Skalkovsky gives an account in his study of late 19th century ballet in St. Petersburg of how Minkus' ""Grand Marche"" from the third act of this ballet ""was the favorite piece of Tsar Alexander II, who in general did not love music. Several units of our troops (the Russian Army) stormed the Plevna to the music of this march.""

1930 ballet by William Grant Still


William Grant Still in 1949, photographed by Carl Van Vechten
Sahdji is a 1930 ballet composition in two-movements by American composer William Grant Still.[1] The ballet was first performed in 1931 under the direction of Howard Hanson at the Eastman School of Music. The work is about twenty minutes long.[2]


Overview[edit]
A description of the ballet is presented as follows:

The setting of the ballet (which calls for chorus, as well) is a hunting festival of the Azande tribe in central Africa. Sahdji, the favorite wife of the Azande chieftain Konombju, is infatuated with his nephew and successor, Mrabo. While Konombju is away on a hunting expedition, Sahdji and Mrabo betray him; a few hours later, at sunset, the hunters return carrying Konombju's body: he has been killed on the expedition. According to tribal custom, the favorite wife of the chieftain must take her life when her husband dies. Sahdji, torn between her loyalty to the death vow and her desire for life and the love of Mrabo, dances before the bier of Konombju and finally stabs herself with the sacrificial dagger.

La somnambule is a ballet-pantomime composed by Ferdinand Hérold and premiered  on 19 September 1827 at the Académie Royale de Musique.  The scenario was by Eugène Scribe, and it was choreographed by Jean-Pierre Aumer. This ballet was produced in 1827 at the height of a fashion for stage works incorporating somnambulism.  The work was quite popular in Paris and inspired many more works incorporating somnambulism, including Vincenzo Bellini's well-known Italian opera La sonnambula.
Although the work was unperformed for over 150 years and remains unpublished, it was rediscovered and recorded under the direction of conductor Richard Bonynge, and released in 2005.

La Sonnambula (The Sleepwalker) is a ballet by the co-founder and ballet master of New York City Ballet, George Balanchine, made to Vittorio Rieti's music using themes from the operas of Vincenzo Bellini including La Sonnambula, Norma, I Puritani and I Capuleti e i Montecchi (1830–35).
The ballet premiered as The Night Shadow  with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo on Wednesday, 27 February 1946, at City Center of Music and Drama, New York, with sets and costumes designed by Dorothea Tanning and costumes executed by Karinska. It was first performed by the New York City Ballet on 6 January 1960 at City Center of Music and Drama.  

The ballet tells the story of a Coquette, a Poet, and a beautiful Sleepwalker. The original 1946 program describes the story as follows: Amid the somber walls of a decaying castle a masked ball has just begun.  The host, an eccentric nobleman, receives his guests, among them a poet and a dazzling coquette.  The poet, seduced by her charms, dances with her as the guests gradually leave the scene, then she too leaves.  As the poet turns to follow, he sees a lovely white apparition gliding across the roofs toward him.  It comes nearer and he sees that it is a beautiful somnambulist.  He loses his heart to her at once, unaware that she is the wife of the host who keeps her locked away from the world.  They dance, and he sees to join her in her realm of dreaming sleep.  But they are seen.  The coquette, flushed with jealousy, steals out to tell the host....All too soon the marvelous sleep-walker drifts away.  The poet would follow her but the guests reenter and their dancing forms a barrier.  Finally, he breaks through and disappears but the host follows too and stabs him.  As he lies unconscious among the terrified guests the white figure of his love appears once more, gently raises him and together they glide away.
The ballet was renamed La Sonnambula in 1961, and has been revived numerous times.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


The Stone Flower (Russian: Каменный цветок), is a ballet by the Soviet composer Alexander Fridlender, based on the Russian Ural folk tale The Stone Flower by Pavel Bazhov.[1] Iosif Keller wrote the Russian language libretto.[2]

Background[edit]
The first version of The Stone Flower was created by the Ural composer Alexander Fridlender in 1944. It premiered at the State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre in Sverdlovsk. Alexander Fridlender himself was the conductor, with Konstantin Muller as the ballet master, and Vladimir Lyudmilin as the stage manager. It was met with significant praise by critics.[3] Bazhov who was at first sceptical about the ballet adaptations of his stories, watched the ballet and liked it in the end.  Another production was made in 1947. Fridlender revised the sheet music, made a lot of changes to the music, scenes, and rewrote the ending of the first act. Emmanuil Krasovitsky was the conductor, Konstantin Muller the ballet master, and Vladimir Lyudmilin the stage manager. Another production was done in 1975, with the ballet master Vitaly Timofeev, the conductor Evgeny Manayev, the artist Nikolay Sitnikov. The Stone Flower is still performed at the Yekaterinburg State Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre.[3]

1964 ballet by George Balanchine

Tarantella is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Grande Tarantelle by Louis Moreau Gottschalk, arranged by Hershy Kay. The ballet premiered on January 7, 1964, at the New York City Center, performed by New York City Ballet's Patricia McBride and Edward Villella.[1]


Production[edit]
George Balanchine originally created Tarantella, a pas de deux, to showcase New York City Ballet dancers Patricia McBride and Edward Villella's techniques, especially the latter's speed and jumps.[2][3][4] According to Villella, Balanchine created Tarantella between rehearsals of his other works, and each time they would only work on small sections and not in order. Villella only realized the stamina required when Balanchine put all the choreography together.[3] He later recalled, ""I would be flying parallel to the floor, and then I would be in the wings, on the ground, gasping for air"".[3] New York Times critic Anna Kisselgoff wrote that Danish choreographer August Bournonville's influence on Balanchine is ""debatable"", but Tarantella is one of Balanchine's ballets that ""paid homage"" to Bournonville.[5]
The title of the ballet is taken from Tarantella, a type of Neapolitan folk dance accompanied by tambourines. Hershy Kay rearranged Louis Moreau Gottschalk's Grande Tarantelle for the ballet.[2] The costumes are designed by Barbara Karinska.[1] The man dresses in red and black and wears a gold earring while the woman is in red and white.

Le Tombeau de CouperinChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicMaurice RavelPremiereMay 29, 1975 (1975-05-29)New York State TheaterOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignRonald BatesGenreNeoclassical ballet
Le Tombeau de Couperin is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Ravel's eponymous orchestral music. The ballet features a cast of sixteen divided into two groups, dancing separately. Le Tombeau de Couperin was made for the New York City Ballet's Ravel Festival, celebrating the composer's centenary, and premiered on May 29, 1975, at the New York State Theater.


Choreography[edit]
Le Tombeau de Couperin features eight couples divided into two groups, called quadrilles, that dances separately.[1]: 290  There are no principal roles in the ballet.[2] Balanchine wrote that the ballet ""doesn't say anything beyond the combination of these dancers moving to Ravel's lovely score.""[3]: 625  Dance critic Richard Buckle described, ""The mood is both pastoral and elegiac.""[1]: 290  Author Nancy Reynolds found that the ballet ""did not observe the overtones of lament"" in the score, but ""retained the aura of formal dances"" through the use of couples and geometric formations.[4]: 324 

Production[edit]
Balanchine decided that for French composer Maurice Ravel's centenary in 1975, the New York City Ballet would hold the Ravel Festival to honor him.[5] In the previous forty years, Balanchine had only made two ballets to Ravel's works.[4]: 319  However, he stated he always enjoyed his music and decided ""it would be a good idea to celebrate this wonderful composer’s life and work by arranging new dances to as many scores as we could.""[3]: 560  He decided to choreograph to Le Tombeau de Couperin, an orchestral score that was a tribute to both François Couperin and French music in general.[3]: 625 
Balanchine uncharacteristically completed the ballet early on in the rehearsal period, then moved on to work on other ballets. Fearing the choreography would be forgotten before the ballet's premiere, ballet master Rosemary Dunleavy gathered the cast and ""got it back together again."" Balanchine kept delaying his participation in these rehearsals despite Dunleavy's persuation. When he finally went to a rehearsal, it was also the first time he watched the ballet from the beginning to end.[1]: 290  The dancers are dressed in practice clothes. The lighting of the ballet is designed by Ronald Bates.[4]: 324 
Following Balanchine's death, Dunleavy inherited the rights to the ballet.[1]: 390

Performances[edit]
Le Tombeau de Couperin premiered on May 29, 1975, at the New York State Theater, on the third program of the Ravel Festival,[5] conducted by Robert Irving.[4]: 324  The School of American Ballet, affiliated with the New York City Ballet, had its students perform the ballet.[6]

Critical reception[edit]
Reviewing a performance months after the premiere, Clive Barnes of the New York Times wrote, ""In Le Tombeau de Couperin he just uses the ensemble, but he uses it with such grace and sensibility that it is itself a star. The ballet looks so handsome and its movements are so extraordinarily well‐aligned and well‐attuned to the music that the entire work from beginning to end absolutely sings. It is one of those ballets that you watch with ever developing wonderment and pleasure, and it should, in the future, stand as a kind of signature for the City Ballet ensemble.""[7]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


2011 ballet with score by Maury Yeston and choreography by William Whitener
Tom Sawyer: A Ballet in Three Acts premiered on October 14, 2011 at the Kauffman Center for the Performing Arts in Kansas City, Missouri. The score is by composer Maury Yeston, with choreography by William Whitener, artistic director of the Kansas City Ballet.[1][2] The ballet is based on Mark Twain's 1876 novel, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
A review by Alastair Macaulay in The New York Times observed: ""It’s quite likely that this is the first all-new, entirely American three-act ballet. It is based on an American literary classic, has an original score by an American composer and was given its premiere by an American choreographer and company ... both the score and the choreography are energetic, robust, warm, deliberately naïve (both ornery and innocent), in ways right for Twain.[3] Paul Horsely in Dance Magazine writes “Tom Sawyer is an inventive amalgam of ballet, folk dance, pantomime, comedy, games, and narrative. It’s also injected with the youthful playfulness that has been Whitener’s signature in works like Gingham Shift, the piece that brought Whitener to Yeston’s attention. 'We’re focusing on a boy’s passage from childhood to his teenage years,' Whitener says, 'and taking responsibility when he and Becky are trapped in the cave—having to grow up quickly.' The ballet is also about “the power of the Mississippi and the grandeur of the great outdoors—and the charm and vitality of youth.”[4] The design team were all Americans as well, consisting of Holly Hynes, (Costumes), Walt Spangler (Set) and Kirk Bookman (Lighting).[5]
A two-disc 90 minute premiere recording of the complete score of Yeston’s Tom Sawyer - A Ballet In Three Acts, adapted from Mark Twain’s classic novel, was recorded at Skywalker Sound with Martin West conducting the seventy-piece San Francisco Ballet Orchestra, and released on the PS Classics label on August 27, 2013.[6] The first act musically depicts the sunny days of Tom in school, his infatuation with Becky Thatcher, and rafting on the river with Huck Finn. The second reveals the boys' witnessing a murder and a frame up at midnight in the cemetery, and the third dramatizes Tom's exonerating testimony at the trial of Muff Potter, and his subsequent discovery of gold in a cave, leading to an ultimate town celebration along the Mississippi. Yeston has subsequently created a 21 minute long Tom Sawyer Suite as a Pops Orchestra offering. [6]
The work originated a year after Yeston's musical Nine opened on Broadway in 1982. Yeston was still an Associate Professor in musicology and Director of Undergraduate Musical Studies at Yale. He noted that few if any of the well-known American ballets (the Aaron Copland masterpieces, or Balanchine’s ballet “On Your Toes”) were even as much as an hour in length, let alone three-acts. He came up with the idea of Twain’s “Tom Sawyer” as a possible appropriate subject for a full length form. The book ""seemed a natural fit principally because its form, like ballet, is episodic”, he said, citing ""The Painting of the Fence"" scene, ""Lost With Becky Thatcher in The Cave,"" ""Witnessing the Murder in the Graveyard,"" as examples.[7] Upon hearing the score William Whitener, Artistic Director of Kansas City Ballet, agreed to choreograph and mount the production, saying ""When I first heard Maury Yeston's score for Tom Sawyer, I realized that we had a grand opportunity to bring this classic story to life as a dance-drama. The wit and beauty within Mr. Yeston's music, and the charm and playfulness of Mark Twain's novel make an ideal match for a ballet"".[8]

Ballet by Darius Milhaud
Le train bleuDarius Milhaud in 1923.ChoreographerBronislava NijinskaMusicDarius MilhaudPremiere20 June 1924Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, ParisOriginal ballet companyBallets russes
Le train bleu  is a one-act ballet choreographed by Bronislava Nijinska to music by Darius Milhaud for Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, based on a scenario by Jean Cocteau. The title was taken from the night train called Le Train Bleu, which transported wealthy passengers from Calais to the Mediterranean Sea.
The ballet is set on the fashionable French Riviera and has a sporting theme, with swimmers, tennis players, and weight lifters. Henri Laurens supplied a Cubist beach scene and Coco Chanel[1][2] outfitted the cast in sportswear. The curtain was painted after Deux femmes courant sur la plage, a 1922 work by Pablo Picasso.
The ballet was first performed on 20 June 1924 at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées in Paris, with Nijinska, who played a tennis player based on Suzanne Lenglen, Lydia Sokolova, Anton Dolin and Leon Woizikowski in the leading roles. The orchestra was conducted by André Messager.

Richard Buckle's biography of Diaghilev made a mistake in citing the setting as Deauville.  Deauville was a fashionable resort in Normandy, and it was not on the line of the Blue Train.[1]

Ballet by Sergei Prokofiev
Trapèze (Russian: Трапе́ция) is a ballet by Sergei Prokofiev. Closely related to his Quintet, Op. 39 (1924), it contains eight movements (in five parts) and lasts 20–25 minutes.[1] The complete ballet in eight movements was first performed in Gotha, a German town near Hanover, on 6 November 1925.[1]


Background[edit]
In 1924, when Prokofiev was staying in Paris, a travelling troupe commissioned a chamber ballet from him. However, the ensemble that provided music accompaniment to the troupe only contained five members. This provided Prokofiev an opportunity to write more chamber music. His most recent chamber piece had been the Overture on Hebrew Themes, Op. 34 (1919).
Later, Prokofiev incorporated the ballet music into two pieces: Quintet, Op. 39 (1924) and Divertissement, Op. 43 (1925–29).

Movements[edit]
The Trapèze Ballet, reconstructed in 2002, is in five parts and eight movements:[1]

Overture
Moderato, molto ritmato
""Matelote""
Allegro
""The Ballerina""
Tema con variazioni
Andante energico
""Dance of the Tumblers""
Allegro sostenuto, ma con brio
Adagio pesante
Allegro precipitato, ma non troppo presto
""Mourning the Ballerina""
Andantino
The related Quintet is in six movements as follows:

Tema con variazioni
Andante energico
Allegro sostenuto, ma con brio
Adagio pesante
Allegro precipitato, ma non troppo presto
Andantino

La ValseChoreographerGeorge BalanchineMusicMaurice RavelPremiereFebruary 20, 1951 (1951-02-20)City Center of Music and DramaOriginal ballet companyNew York City BalletDesignKarinskaJean RosenthalGenreneoclassical ballet
La Valse is a ballet choreographed by George Balanchine to Maurice Ravel's Valses Nobles et Sentimentales and La Valse. It premiered on February 20, 1951, at the City Center of Music and Drama, performed by the New York City Ballet. The ballet depicts dancers waltzing in a ballroom, during which a woman becomes attracted to a figure of death, and ultimately dies.


Choreography[edit]
The first part of the ballet is set to Valses Nobles et Sentimentales, which features eight waltzes, with the first used as an overture.[1] The second waltz features three female soloists, while the third, fourth and fifth waltzes are each danced by a couple.[1] The woman from the fifth waltz then dances a solo during the sixth waltz. In the seventh waltz, her partner returns to the stage, joined by the three soloists from the second waltz and the woman exits.[2]
In the eighth waltz, a ballerina in white enters and dances. A man then enters. Dance critic Richard Buckle described, ""They do backbends and at first seem not to know each other. They dance with a ceremonial and slightly depraved elegance.""[1] At the end of the waltz, the man lifts the ballerina and they exit the stage.[2] Tanaquil Le Clercq, who originated the ballerina role, recalled,  ""the atmosphere was lovely, it was like going to a party. There wasn't anything terribly hard in the variation, and yet you could work within what you had and make it different. Balanchine said to think of German-style contractions for it – a feeling for 'plastique.'""[3]
The La Valse section follows. At first, dancers search for each other under the spotlight. Balanchine wrote, ""All the dancers seem to be waiting for the waltz to emerge through the weird music that holds it in abeyance.""[2] As the stage brightens, a corps de ballet of eight men and sixteen women waltzes, and the fifth waltz couple also returns.[2] Then the ballerina in white and her partner enters and dances. Balanchine described, ""Their dance is slow at first; the ballerina's movements are retarded and she seeks to move more freely as the waltz attempts to resume its previous intensity."" But, as the music intensifies, ""The girl turns with despairing speed to her partner's arms.""[2]
Then, a figure of Death,[a] in black, emerge alongside his servant.[2][3] The women kneels before him while the men looks away. The white ballerina is terrified but attracted to Death. He forces her to put on black necklace, gloves and dress, as she becomes more fascinated, before presenting her with a bouquet. As the music goes faster, Death forces the ballerina to dance faster and faster, ""almost mindlessly"", as Le Clercq described. She ultimately dies, while Death disappears.[2] Le Clercq remarked, ""the dramatic mood grew completely out of the steps.""[3] The corps de ballet resumes their waltzing. The ballerina's partner carries her dead body, before she is lifted by a group of men, who turn around and around at the centre of the stage.[2]
In 1974, Balanchine made a revision to the ballet, so Death would make a brief appearance in the Eighth Waltz. Balanchine told dancer Francisco Moncion that he had ""always wanted to have the figure of Death somewhere in the first section as a premonition."" Therefore, as Moncion put it, ""there is a special place for him in the Eighth Waltz. The figure appears from nowhere in the spotlight, suddenly and only for a moment, just as she is going off, and it's very frightening.""[3]

Production[edit]
In 1951, Balanchine decided to choreograph to a ballet to Maurice Ravel's La Valse. Ravel wrote the score as a ballet for ballet impresario Sergei Diaghilev, who rejected it. However, the score had been use for several unsuccessful ballets.[1] Finding La Valse too short, Balanchine decided to also include Valses Nobles et Sentimentales,[1] which William Dollar previously choreographed to for Ballet Caravan, Balanchine's former company.[4] Moncion's character was not named in the program notes. However, Moncion specifically recalled Balanchine asking him to portray a figure of Death, and the latter had also referred the role as ""Death"".[3] Le Clercq did not receive any notes about acting or reactions from Balanchine.[3]
Valses Nobles et Sentimentales, originally written for the piano, was orchestrated for the ballet.[4] At the time, the New York City Ballet Orchestra was incapable of performing a score this large in scale. However, after being pressured by conductor Léon Barzin, the City Center of Music and Drama, managing director Morton Baum allowed the company to add a dozen more musicians.[4] The costumes, ball gowns for women and evening suit for men, took inspiration from France, and were designed by Karinska, who had lived in Paris prior to moving to the United States.[1] The original lighting was designed by Jean Rosenthal.[3]

Performances[edit]
La Valse premiered on February 20, 1951, at the City Center of Music and Drama,[5]: 427  with Barzin conducting.[6] It was removed from the company's repertory in 1956, when Le Clercq became paralysed after contracting polio.[3][7] La Valse was then not performed until 1962, after Le Clercq, who had avoided ballet for some years, taught her role to Patricia McBride.[3][5]: 242  Moncion and Nicholas Magallanes were the only original cast members to reprise their roles at this revival, though Jillana took over the role that was originated by Diana Adams.[8]
Other ballet companies that have performed La Valse include the Kirov Ballet,[9] Stuttgart Ballet,[10] Dutch National Ballet,[11] Pacific Northwest Ballet,[12] Los Angeles Ballet, and Suzanne Farrell Ballet.[13][14]

Critical reception[edit]
New York Times critic John Martin commented, ""There was a challenge in the music for Balanchine is not to be denied; in accepting it he has been forced to extend himself in new directions, and the result is a ballet which, though still characteristically  Balanchinian, has many exciting variations from that norm. Under the surface, indeed, is the fundamental quality of a different Balanchine altogether.""[15]

Videography[edit]
In June 1953, La Valse was featured in Premiere, the first commercially sponsored television program to be broadcast in color that was aired by CBS, staged by Sol Hurok.[16]
In 2015, La Valse was filmed during the New York City Ballet's appearances at Théâtre du Châtelet. It was aired on PBS Great Performances broadcast ""New York City Ballet in Paris"" in 2017.[17]
Footage of Le Clercq in La Valse were featured in Nancy Buirski's documentary Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq.[7]

Notes[edit]


^ While the role was not named in the program, Balanchine called the role ""Death."" Francisco Moncion, who originated the role, specifically recalled that Balanchine asked him to portray ""Death"".[3]

Voices of SpringChoreographerFrederick AshtonMusicJohann StraussPremiere31 December 1977Royal Opera House, LondonOriginal ballet companyThe Royal Opera
Voices of Spring is a short pas de deux ballet by Sir Frederick Ashton, set to the music of the Frühlingsstimmen waltz by Johann Strauss II. It was originally written to be included as a divertissement in a 1977–78 production of Strauss's  operetta Die Fledermaus by the Royal Opera, alongside an adaptation of the Explosions-Polka, and first performed as an independent piece by the Royal Ballet in late 1978.


Background[edit]
The Royal Opera performed Die Fledermaus for New Year's Eve 1977; this was the company premiere of the work, produced by Leopold Lindtberg and featuring, among others, Hermann Prey as Eisenstein and Kiri Te Kanawa as Rosalinde. The performance was broadcast live in Britain on BBC 2 and BBC Radio 3, and was relayed to the United States where it was repeated on television later in the day.[1]
The production contained two additional Strauss pieces, choreographed by Ashton as ballets: the Frühlingsstimmen waltz and the Explosions-Polka. These appeared in Act II of the  operetta, part of a ball scene. The Explosions-Polka was performed by an ensemble cast, while the Frühlingsstimmen waltz, a pas de deux was performed by Merle Park and Wayne Eagling.[2]
In September 1978, the Frühlingsstimmen waltz dance was premiered as an independent piece, under its English name Voices of Spring, at the Ambassador Auditorium in Los Angeles.[3]

Description[edit]
Frühlingsstimmen itself is a short piece with no plot, around eight minutes long. It is a lively Viennese waltz and the dance is suited to the music; it has a strong sense of effortless and joyful movement, strongly influenced by the boldness of the Bolshoi Ballet.[4]
It is performed by one male and one female dancer, neither named and both simply identified as ""Dancer"".[5]

Critical reception[edit]
Reviews of the first performance did not focus on the dance, but the Times described it as ""danced admirably and a great improvement on the Explosions-Polka"".[6] The 1980s independent performances were likewise not heavily remarked upon. In the 2004 revival, the Guardian noted that while not the centrepiece of the performance, Voices was ""the kind of crowd-rousing display that suits programmes of highlights"".[7]

Revivals[edit]
The piece is rarely performed, but was revived for performance by the Royal Ballet in 1981 and 1983, when it was again performed by Eagling and Park, then in 2004 and 2012.[8] In 1981, it was part of a programme of varied works and replaced a performance of the pas de deux from Sylvia, which Ashton had decided should not be performed out of the context of the main ballet.[9] The 2004 performance at the Royal Opera House was part of a series of Ashton works performed to mark his centenary, danced by Mara Galeazzi and Viacheslav Samodurov, and was coached in part by Merle Park.[5] The Royal Ballet also marked the centenary  with performances at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York in July,[10] and in England later in the year,[7] danced by Alina Cojocaru and Johan Kobborg.
The most recent performance was again as part of a series of works by Ashton, marking 25 years since his death, and was danced alternatively by Yuhiui Choe and Alexander Campbell, and Emma Maguire and Valentino Zuchetti.[11]

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia



Walpurgisnacht Ballet is a ballet made by New York City Ballet's co-founder and founding choreographer George Balanchine for a 1975 production of Gounod's 1859 Faust at the Théâtre National de l'Opéra, Paris, including Gounod's additional ballet music from 1869. The New York City Ballet premiere was the first presentation of the dance as an independent work, on Thursday, 15 May 1980 at the New York State Theater, Lincoln Center. Balanchine had previously made dances for productions of Faust at the Opéra de Monte-Carlo, danced by Diaghilev's Ballets Russes; in 1935 for the Metropolitan Opera; and 1945 for the Opera Nacional, Mexico City.
Walpurgisnacht is found at the beginning of the last act of Faust. Mephistopheles shows Faust the folk celebration before May Day, when the souls of the dead are released briefly to wander as they will. The ballet does not directly depict the Walpurgis Night but builds on a sense of joyful revelry.
